Silkworm as a model lepidopteran insect and important economic insect, has been widely studied in life science, however, the current knowledge on the glycosylation status of its proteome is not satisfactory, and little is known about how pathogenic infections could affect the glycosylation status. This study performed large scale glycosite mapping for the silkworm Bombyx mori P50 strain, and quantitatively compared with that infected with the Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV). Some 400 glycoproteins were mapped in the silkworm, including N- and O-glycoproteins. Upon virus infection, the glycosylation levels of 41 N-glycopeptides were significantly changed, some of them belonging to transmembrane glycoproteins. The O-glycosylation profiles were also affected. In addition, 4 BmCPV-encoded viral proteins were found to be glycosylated for the first time, including polyhedrin, P101, VP3, and the NS protein. This study drafted a silkworm protein glycosylation map and underlined the potential impact of virus infection on glycosylation. Significance This study reveals the characteristics of the glycoproteome in the silkworm strain P50, and quantitatively compared to that infected by the virus BmCPV, which underlines the impact of virus infection on the alteration of protein glycosylation in invertebrate species. Our findings add to the knowledge of the post translational modifications of this model organism, and also uncovered for the first time the glycosylation status of the viral proteins expressed by BmCPV.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Feifei; Li, Dong; Song, Dandan; Huo, Shuhao; Ma, Shangshang; L\u00FC, Peng; Liu, Xiaoyong; Yao, Qin; Chen, Keping","journal":"J Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d04e4cd58ea23406fc089f9f700774c58e38505e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360640/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391920301706?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874391920301706","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycosylation status","glycosylation levels","silkworm protein glycosylation map","alteration of protein glycosylation","virus BmCPV","O-glycosylation profiles","biological functions of protein glycosylation","silkworm strain P50","study","potential impact of virus infection","silkworm Bombyx mori P50 strain","NS protein","O-glycoproteins","Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus","viral proteins","time","transmembrane glycoproteins","model lepidopteran insect","model organism","current knowledge","N-glycopeptides","important economic insect","large scale glycosite mapping","post translational modifications","glycoproteome","P101","VP3","characteristics","invertebrate species","polyhedrin","pathogenic infections","life science","Significance","addition","lower organisms","findings"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiaoming; Zeng, Wenbing; Li, Xiang; Chen, Haonan; Shi, Linping; Li, Xinghui; Xiang, Hongnian; Cao, Yang; Chen, Hui; Liu, Chen; Wang, Jian","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6603736417752dd37ad8b93c86d1c1c90d883c69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132551.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02324-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Southwest China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed COVID","rare cases","diagnosing COVID","suspicious of COVID","clinical manifestations of COVID","series of confirmed cases","absorbed lesions","imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients","patchy ground glass opacities","follow-up chest CT examinations","Southwest China","evolvement features of chest CT images","confirmed coronavirus disease","consolidation of lesions co-existing","imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass","multiple lesions of bilateral lungs","Wuhan","common clinical manifestations","mixed consolidation","peripheral lung","infection pneumonia","retrospective study","pericardial effusion","characteristics","important role","pleural thickening","hydrothorax","people","history of close contact","included cough","mediastinal lymph nodes","Complications","fever","data","CONCLUSION","progression","short period of time","METHODS","Hubei","average","days","significant changes","Chinese hospitals","RESULTS","total","BACKGROUND","aim","lobes"],"language":"en"},

Road and air traffic data have been used to model these processes at national and global scales. At metropolitan scales, however, mobility patterns are fundamentally different and less directly observable. Estimating the spatial distribution of infection has public health utility, but few studies have investigated this at an urban scale. In this study we address the question of whether the use of urban-scale mobility data can improve the prediction of spatial patterns of influenza infection. We compare the use of different sources of urban-scale mobility data, and investigate the impact of other factors relevant to modelling mobility, including mixing within and between regions, and the influence of hub and spoke commuting patterns. METHODS: We used journey-to-work (JTW) data from the Australian 2011 Census, and GPS journey data from the Sygic GPS Navigation \u0026 Maps mobile app, to characterise population mixing patterns in a spatially-explicit SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) meta-population model. RESULTS: Using the JTW data to train the model leads to an increase in the proportion of infections that arise in central Melbourne, which is indicative of the city\u2019s spoke-and-hub road and public transport networks, and of the commuting patterns reflected in these data. Using the GPS data increased the infections in central Melbourne to a lesser extent than the JTW data, and produced a greater heterogeneity in the middle and outer regions. Despite the limitations of both mobility data sets, the model reproduced some of the characteristics observed in the spatial distribution of reported influenza cases. CONCLUSIONS: Urban mobility data sets can be used to support models that capture spatial heterogeneity in the transmission of infectious diseases at a metropolitan scale. These data should be adjusted to account for relevant urban features, such as highly-connected hubs where the resident population is likely to experience a much lower force of infection that the transient population. In contrast to national and international scales, the relationship between mobility and infection at an urban level is much less apparent, and requires a richer characterisation of population mobility and contact.

Vaccination of cattle against BHV-1 is a high priority. A major concern of currently modified live BHV-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection and subsequent reactivation resulting in many outbreaks. Thus, there is a need for alternative strategies. We generated two recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) expressing the glycoprotein D (gD) of BHV-1 from an added gene. One recombinant, rLaSota/gDFL, expressed gD without any modification. The other recombinant, rLaSota/gDF, expressed a chimeric gD in which the ectodomain of gD was fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the NDV fusion F glycoprotein. Remarkably, the native gD expressed by rLaSota/gDFL virus was incorporated into the NDV virion 2.5-fold more efficiently than the native NDV proteins, whereas the chimeric gD was not detectably incorporated even though it was abundantly expressed on the infected cell surface. The expression of gD did not increase the virulence of the rNDV vectors in chickens. A single intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of calves with either recombinant NDV elicited mucosal and systemic antibodies specific to BHV-1, with the responses to rLaSota/gDFL being higher than those to rLaSota/gDF. Following challenge with BHV-1, calves immunized with the recombinant NDVs had lower titers and earlier clearance of challenge virus compared to the empty vector control, and reduced disease was observed with rLaSota/gDFL. Following challenge, the titers of serum antibodies specific to BHV-1 were higher in the animals immunized with the rNDV vaccines compared to the rNDV parent virus, indicating that the vaccines primed for secondary responses. Our data suggest that NDV can be used as a vaccine vector in bovines and that BHV-1 gD may be useful in mucosal vaccine against BHV-1 infection, but might require augmentation by a second dose or the inclusion of additional BHV-1 antigens.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khattar, Sunil K.; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7649a2fc203b3f32bb54f9226adcd108152094d5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e638c32460a466670deb0dd292265d65f4f8f971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3428038.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.02.051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10002197; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10002197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20189484/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3428038?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rLaSota","chimeric gD","native gD","ectodomain of gD","expression of gD","modified live BHV","inclusion of additional BHV","recombinant NDVs","gDFL virus","NDV virion","rNDV vaccines","native NDV proteins","rNDV parent virus","NDV fusion F glycoprotein","recombinant Newcastle disease viruses","mucosal vaccine","earlier clearance of challenge virus","vaccine vector","rNDV vectors","titers of serum antibodies specific","systemic antibodies specific","lower titers","latent infection","major concern","reduced disease","glycoprotein D","vector control","Vaccination of cattle","secondary responses","major cause of respiratory tract diseases","intratracheal inoculation of calves","cytoplasmic tail","ability","subsequent reactivation","transmembrane domain","dose","virulence","fold","bovines","chickens","antigens","animals","need","alternative strategies","infected cell surface","outbreaks","augmentation","Bovine herpesvirus","high priority","added gene","modification","data"],"language":"en"},

They are extremely common causes of morbidity in the competent hosts and some are associated with significant mortality in the compromised individuals. With wider application of molecular techniques, novel viruses are being described and old viruses are found to have new significance in different epidemiological and clinical settings. Some of these emerging pathogens may have the potential to cause pandemics or global spread of a severe disease, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza. Antiviral therapy of viral respiratory infections is often unnecessary in the competent hosts because most of them are self\u2010limiting and effective agents are not always available. In the immunocompromised individuals or for infections caused by highly pathogenic viruses, such as avian influenza viruses (AIV), antiviral treatment is highly desirable, despite the fact that many of the agents may not have undergone stringent clinical trials. In immunocompetent hosts, antiviral therapy can be stopped early because adaptive immune response can usually be mounted within 5\u201314 days. However, the duration of antiviral therapy in immunosuppressed hosts depends on clinical and radiological resolution, the degree and duration of immunosuppression, and therefore maintenance therapy is sometimes needed after the initial response. Immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis appear to be promising directions for future research. Appropriate and targeted immunomodulation may play an important adjunctive role in some of these infections by limiting the extent of end\u2010organ damage and multi\u2010organ failure in some fulminant infections.","publish_time":"2008-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"WONG, Samson S.Y.; YUEN, Kwok\u2010Yung","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0034ff8bf07e25648b83a1948615b1634ef9e80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18922142/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01404.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Antiviral therapy of viral respiratory infections","duration of antiviral therapy","novel viruses","respiratory tract infections","avian influenza viruses","old viruses","pathogenic viruses","fulminant infections","immunosuppressed hosts","clinical settings","immunocompetent hosts","antiviral treatment","maintenance therapy","important pathogens","severe acute respiratory syndrome","stringent clinical trials","organ damage","severe disease","duration of immunosuppression","effective agents","emerging pathogens","immunocompromised individuals","initial response","multi\u2010organ failure","important adjunctive role","care facility settings","adaptive immune response","community","new significance","radiological resolution","potential","global spread","degree","health","extent of end","AIV","wider application of molecular techniques","promising directions","targeted immunomodulation","pandemics","common causes of morbidity","significant mortality","immunoprophylaxis","future research","Immunotherapy","fact","days"],"language":"en"},

Human mobility and travel patterns influence the spread of infection between cities and countries. We find that the infection severity in downstream cities during outbreaks is related to transmission rate, recovery rate, travel rate, travel duration and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. The peak value of the infected population in downstream cities is slightly higher than that in source cities. However, as the number of cities increases, the severity increase percentage during outbreaks between end and source cities is constant. The surveillance of important nodes connecting cities, such as airports and train stations, can help delay the occurrence time of infection outbreaks. The city-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to these cities, but also to cities that are strongly connected (i.e., have a high travel rate) to them. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to other downstream cities, but only slightly to itself. Surveillance conducted in hub cities is highly efficient in controlling infection transmission. Only strengthening the individual immunity of frequent travellers is not efficient for infection control. However, reducing the number of person-to-person contacts per day effectively limits the spread of infection.","publish_time":"2019-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Nan; Zhao, Pengcheng; Li, Yuguo","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/002160a433024de8c5e80b210f0b54e5d029fa57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094123.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319300979; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319300979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851275/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["downstream cities","number of cities","source cities","city-entry surveillance of hub cities","spread of infection","infection severity","infection transmission","infection control","high travel rate","transmission rate","person contacts","occurrence time of infection outbreaks","average number of person","travel duration","recovery rate","travel patterns","surveillance of important nodes","day","human life","Human mobility","end","infected population","percentage","individual immunity of frequent travellers","Abstract Infectious disease","airports","peak value","train stations","countries"],"language":"en"},

We estimated perception by components of The Health Belief Model (HBM), preventive behaviors consisted of avoidance behaviors, and the recommended behaviors by the Korea Center of Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Desire for vaccination was identified. RESULTS: The 1,837 participants comprised hospital employees (n = 880, 47.9%) and outpatients (n = 957, 52.1%). Of all hospital employees, 491 (55.8%) and 708 (80.5%) perceived susceptibility of the pandemic influenza and benefits of the preventive behaviors, respectively.

One of the five recipients of G0 donor derived NT embryos (20%) delivered one live male cloned kitten, whereas 4 of 15 recipients of the G1 cloned donor cat derived NT embryos (26%) delivered a total of seven male second-generation cloned kittens (four live kittens from one surrogate, plus two stillborn kittens, and one live kitten that died 2d after birth from three other surrogate mothers). The four second-generation cloned kittens from the same surrogate all had a white coat color; three of the four second-generation cloned kittens had two blue eyes, and one of the second-generation cloned kittens had an odd-eye color. Despite low cloning efficiency, cloned cats can be used as donor cats to produce second-generation cloned cats.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, X. J.; Lee, H. S.; Yu, X.

Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains. IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Yount, Boyd L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Hale, Andrew; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Anthony, Simon J.; Wang, Lingshu; Graham, Barney; Randell, Scott H.; Lipkin, W.

The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients. METHODS: Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts. RESULTS: A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. CONCLUSION: We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Tracy H.

BoHV-1 either alone or in association with other respiratory cattle pathogens causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry. The aim of this work was to validate a guinea pig model as an alternative method to the current BoHV-1 vaccine potency testing in calves. Guinea pigs were immunized with two doses of vaccine, 21 days apart and sampled at 30 days post vaccination (dpv). BoHV-1 antibody (Ab) response to vaccination in guinea pigs, measured by ELISA and virus neutralization (VN), was statistically compared to the Ab response in cattle. The guinea pig model showed a dose\u2013response relationship to the BoVH-1 antigen concentration in the vaccine and it was able to discriminate among vaccines containing 1log10 difference in its BoHV-1 concentration with very good repeatability and reproducibility (CV\u226420%). A regression analysis of the Ab titers obtained in guinea pigs and bovines at 30 and 60dpv, respectively, allowed us to classify vaccines in three potency categories: \u201Cvery satisfactory\u201D, \u201Csatisfactory\u201D and \u201Cunsatisfactory\u201D. Bovines immunized with vaccines corresponding to each of these three categories were experimentally challenged with BoVH-1 virus, the level of protection, as measured by reduction of virus shedding and disease severity, correlated well with the vaccine category used. Data generated by 85 experiments, which included vaccination of calves and guinea pigs with 18 reference vaccines of known potency, 8 placebos and 18 commercial vaccines, was subjected to statistical analysis. Concordance analysis indicated almost perfect agreement between the model and the target species for Ab titers measured by ELISA and almost perfect to substantial agreement when Ab titers were measured by VN. Taken together these results indicate that the developed guinea pig model represents a novel and reliable tool to estimate batch-to-batch vaccine potency and to predict efficacy of killed BoHV-1 veterinary vaccines.","publish_time":"2010-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parre\u00F1o, Viviana; L\u00F3pez, Mar\u00EDa Virginia; Rodriguez, Daniela; Vena, Mar\u00EDa Marta; Izuel, Mercedes; Filippi, Jorge; Romera, Alejandra; Faverin, Claudia; Bellinzoni, Rodolfo; Fernandez, Fernando; Marangunich, Laura","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/703481e322f6c0cc6ee0808b0ed750bb769bf029.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.01.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10000678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20123054/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10000678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Concordance","VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Guinea pigs","Ab titers","Ab response","developed guinea pig model","batch vaccine potency","current BoHV","commercial vaccines","veterinary vaccines","vaccine potency testing","reference vaccines of known potency","potency categories","doses of vaccine","vaccine category","vaccination of calves","ELISA","perfect agreement","response relationship","BoVH","days post vaccination","reduction of virus","virus neutralization","Concordance analysis","statistical analysis","regression analysis","VN","bovines","dpv","substantial agreement","antigen concentration","bovine herpesvirus","respiratory cattle pathogens","Abstract Infectious Bovine Rhinothracheitis","significant economic losses","novel","IBR","alternative method","placebos","target species","efficacy","good repeatability","reliable tool","livestock industry","reproducibility","1log10 difference","antibody","disease severity","CV","association","level of protection","experiments","work","results","Data","aim","infection"],"language":"en"},

However, the functional characterization of plant virus cysteine and serine proteases has highlighted their diversity in terms of biological activities, cleavage site specificities, regulatory mechanisms, and three-dimensional structures. The recent discovery of a plant picorna-like virus glutamic protease with possible structural similarities with fungal and bacterial glutamic proteases also revealed new unexpected sources of protease domains.

Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence\u2014measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak\u2014helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Louis; Fast, Shannon M.; Markuzon, Natasha","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17e4de7b95ed440d0df3a87e85e9fca8b64b0de7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6361417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Mexico City","Washington"],"keyphrases":["effect of media","media attention","media impact","media function","disease model","observed media coverage","disease coverage","disease spread","spread of disease","media influence dependent","approximated media effect","disease incidence","disease dynamics","different levels of media coverage","observed transmission dynamics","network-based model","probability of transmission","transmission pattern","case of H1N1 transmission","outbreak","rate of spread","low incidence","epidemic forecasting","size of epidemic","weekly count of news articles","hand washing","DC","compliance","diseases","typical influenza season","time series","self-protection","number of cases","real data","social distancing","preventive measures","Mexico City","Washington","SARS","individuals","local interactions","models","Ebola","turn","alternative approach"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this study were to determine the early and dynamic alterations of Th1 and Th2 populations to community-acquired severe sepsis upon onset among previously immunocompetent patients and whether it was related to clinical outcomes. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis within 24 h upon onset were included as septic group. Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients without severe sepsis were recruited as controls. Whole blood was collected on D0, 3rd day (D3) and 7th day (D7) for septic group and once upon enrollment for controls. Th1 and Th2 populations were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for associations with 28-day mortality using cox proportional hazard models. Associations of dynamic alterations of Th cell subpopulations with clinical outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that community-acquired severe sepsis patients (n = 71) had increased Th2/Th1 and Th2 populations, compared to healthy controls (n = 7) and critically ill patients without severe sepsis (n = 7) at admission. Among the septic cohort, values of Th2/Th1 were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors on D0 (p = 0.04), D3 (p \u003C 0.001) and D7 (p \u003C 0.001). Patients with persistently increasing Th2/Th1 demonstrated the highest mortality (47.1%) and incidence of ICU-acquired infections (64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Th2/Th1 was markedly up-regulated with Th2 dominance upon community-acquired severe sepsis onset among previously immunocompetent patients and its persistently dynamic increase was associated with ICU-acquired infections and 28-day death.

Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes\u2019 function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.

Due to the lack of treatment options or vaccines, and a high fatality rate, CCHF virus (CCHFV) is considered a high-priority pathogen according to the WHO R\u0026D Blueprint. Several commercial reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and serological diagnostic assays for CCHFV are already available, including febrile agent panels to distinguish CCHFV from other viral haemorrhagic fever agents; however, the majority of international laboratories use inhouse assays. As CCHFV has numerous amplifying animal hosts, a cross-sectoral \u2018One Health\u2019 approach to outbreak prevention is recommended to enhance notifications and enable early warning for genetic and epidemiological shifts in the human, animal and tick populations. However, a lack of guidance for surveillance in animals, harmonisation of case identification and validated serodiagnostic kits for animal testing hinders efforts to strengthen surveillance systems. Additionally, as RT-PCR tests tend to be lineage-specific for regional circulating strains, there is a need for pan-lineage sensitive diagnostics. Adaptation of existing tests to point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms that can be implemented in clinic or field-based settings would be of value given the potential for CCHFV outbreaks in remote or low-resource areas. Finally, improved access to clinical specimens for validation of diagnostics would help to accelerate development of new tests.

Despite an intensive vaccination program, influenza infections remain a recurrent, yet unsolved public health problem. Secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate influenza infections during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is frequently associated with these co-infections, including the 2009 influenza pandemic. Damage to alveolar epithelium is a major contributor to severe influenza-bacterial co-infections and can result in gas exchange abnormalities, fluid leakage, and respiratory insufficiency. These deleterious manifestations likely involve both pathogen- and host-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms (pathogen- and/or host-mediated) underlying influenza-bacterial co-infection pathogenesis. To address this, we characterized the contributions of viral-, bacterial-, and host-mediated factors to the altered structure and function of alveolar epithelial cells during co-infection with a focus on the 2009 pandemic influenza (pdm2009) and MRSA. Here, we characterized pdm2009 and MRSA replication kinetics, temporal host kinome responses, modulation of MRSA virulence factors, and disruption of alveolar barrier integrity in response to pdm2009-MRSA co-infection. Our results suggest that alveolar barrier disruption during co-infection is mediated primarily through host response dysregulation, resulting in loss of alveolar barrier integrity.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nickol, Michaela E.; Ciric, Justine; Falcinelli, Shane D.; Chertow, Daniel S.; Kindrachuk, Jason","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edee1fd45587a0a71d88a5db58cc81342840e2f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6409999.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6409999/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["MRSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe influenza-bacterial co-infections","pdm2009-MRSA co-infection","influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","influenza-bacterial co-infection pathogenesis","complicate influenza infections","Influenza viruses","host-mediated factors","host-mediated mechanisms","alveolar barrier disruption","Secondary bacterial infections","alveolar epithelium","disruption of alveolar barrier integrity","loss of alveolar barrier integrity","host response dysregulation","MRSA replication kinetics","modulation of MRSA virulence factors","function of alveolar epithelial cells","temporal host kinome responses","global public health","unsolved public health problem","Staphylococcus aureus","altered structure","major contributor","fluid leakage","pandemics","seasonal outbreaks","gas exchange abnormalities","methicillin-resistant","threat","focus","intensive vaccination program","increased morbidity","respiratory insufficiency","deaths","Damage","results","paucity of information","mortality","deleterious manifestations","contributions of viral","year"],"language":"en"},

On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the predictors of high baseline FFAs level were diabetes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56, 18.43, p = 0.008) and baseline cholesterol level (aOR, 4.29; 95% CI: 11.64, 11.19, p = 0.003). Serial levels of FFAs did not differ with time between permissive underfeeding and standard feeding groups. FFAs level was not associated with 90-day mortality (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.09, 2.60, p = 0.40). Conclusion: We conclude that high FFAs level in critically ill patients is associated with features of metabolic syndrome and is not affected by short-term permissive underfeeding.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arabi, Yaseen M.; Tamimi, Waleed; Jones, Gwynne; Jawdat, Dunia; Tamim, Hani; Al-Dorzi, Hasan M.; Sadat, Musharaf; Afesh, Lara; Sakhija, Maram; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/286ffc3b37fa763b765bb3d8403fd4deacff80c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6412238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6412238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high FFAs level","normal FFAs level","predictors of high baseline FFAs level","ill patients","baseline cholesterol level","Serial levels of FFAs","enrolled patients","short-term permissive underfeeding","aOR","study period","higher creatinine","higher total cholesterol levels","females","mmol","Objectives","nutritional correlates of high free fatty acids","pre-planned sub-study","higher blood glucose","day mortality","lower ratio of partial pressure of oxygen","Target Enteral Feeding","fraction of inspired oxygen","adjusted odds ratio","standard feeding groups","effect of short-term caloric restriction","PermiT","diabetes","Adult","multivariable logistic regression analysis","time","trial","diabetics","Method","outcomes","Results","features of metabolic syndrome","critical illness","days","intensive care unit","insulin","association","confidence interval","Conclusion","enrollment"],"language":"en"},

This simply implies the necessity to produce well-rounded medical graduates (physicians) who can competently integrate clinical knowledge/skills (for disease treatment) and public health knowledge/skills (for disease prevention). Moreover, the medical training (MD/MBBS curriculum) largely gives emphasis to the clinical skills needed to treat individual patients, whereas public health training (MPH degree) emphasizes the methods needed to improve the overall community health. Bridging the gap between patients and community is best achieved through a combined multidisciplinary training in both medicine and public health, that is, dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs are the way forward. In United States, for example, there are \u003E80 medical schools that offer such joint MD-MPH programs, whereas there is none in Saudi Arabia. Herein, I call on higher education bodies to implement dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs in Saudi Arabia. To the best of knowledge, this is the first ever report to call for such an innovative implementation. Also, this short communication briefly sheds light on background, rationale, benefits, curriculum design, and future directions of such programs. The implications of this perspective (i.e. dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs) should not be limited to Saudi Arabia only; rather, it should be contemplated by the other medical curricula in the different countries.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abu-Zaid, Ahmed; Eshaq, Abdulaziz M.; Alkattan, Khaled","journal":"J Family Med Prim Care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6436275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6436275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MPH degree","dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs","medical training","public health training","public health knowledge","joint MD-MPH programs","MBBS curriculum","Saudi Arabia","clinical skills","clinical knowledge","medical curricula","medical schools","best of knowledge","overall community health","combined multidisciplinary training","well-rounded medical graduates","disease treatment","curriculum design","individual patients","disease prevention","multidisciplinary approach","healthcare problem","background","benefits","light","rationale","medicine","future directions","physicians","higher education bodies","methods","perspective","emphasis","short communication","example","different countries","necessity","way","United States","implications","gap","innovative implementation","symptoms","source"],"language":"en"},

However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1(\u2212/\u2212) and OAS3(\u2212/\u2212) macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Wook-Bin; Choi, Won Young; Lee, Dong-Hyun; Shim, Hyeran; Kim-Ha, Jeongsil; Kim, Young-Joon","journal":"BMB Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8f1edfb8249017f774ccc05dea2ab17be144313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6443328.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OAS1","OAS3 gene","interferon-responsive genes","interferon-stimulated genes","OAS3 act","human macrophages","OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion","expression of chemokines","gene expression","viral RNA","mediated induction of chemokines","viral double","viral replication","viral infection","interferon-induced helicase C domain","type","TLR4-mediated induction","inducible gene","CRISPR-associated protein","human myeloid cell lines","chemokine activity","OAS proteins","intracellular poly","IFIH1","negative regulators","interspaced short palindromic repeats","ribonuclease","role","MDA5","Cas9","TLR3","technology","RNaseL","system","synthetic surrogate","interferons","RIG","degradation of rRNA","effect","retinoic-acid","mRNA sequencing analysis","oligoadenylate synthetase","cells","Toll","receptor","ds","stimulation","data"],"language":"en"},

The recent large outbreak of EVD in Western Africa (2013\u20132016) highlighted the worldwide threat represented by the disease and its impact on global public health and the economy. The development of highly needed anti-Ebola virus antivirals has been so far hampered by the shortage of tools to study their life cycle in vitro, allowing to screen for potential active compounds outside a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment. Importantly, the development of surrogate models to study Ebola virus entry in a BSL-2 setting, such as viral pseudotypes and Ebola virus-like particles, tremendously boosted both our knowledge of the viral life cycle and the identification of promising antiviral compounds interfering with viral entry. In this context, the combination of such surrogate systems with large-scale small molecule compounds and haploid genetic screenings, as well as rational drug design and drug repurposing approaches will prove priceless in our quest for the development of a treatment for EVD.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salata, Cristiano; Calistri, Arianna; Alvisi, Gualtiero; Celestino, Michele; Parolin, Cristina; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c7d1097a0fc23516fc084e127333ec4bbf9ca94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466262.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":["Western Africa"],"keyphrases":["Ebola Virus Disease","study Ebola virus entry","viral entry","viral life cycle","needed anti-Ebola virus antivirals","development of surrogate models","viral pseudotypes","BSL","potential active compounds","large-scale small molecule compounds","surrogate systems","identification of promising antiviral compounds","recent large outbreak of EVD","drug repurposing approaches","rational drug design","haploid genetic screenings","biosafety level","global public health","Western Africa","impact","combination","quest","knowledge","setting","particles","high fatality rate","member","lethal transmissible infections","economy","treatment","shortage of tools","Filoviridae family","worldwide threat","context","containment"],"language":"en"},

The known papillomavirus (PV) representatives infect vertebrates, and there are currently more than 130 recognized PV species in more than 50 genera. We identified 12 novel avian papillomavirus (APV) types in wild birds that could represent five distinct species and two genera. Viruses were detected in paired oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs collected from six bird species, increasing the number of avian species known to harbor PVs by 40%. A new duck PV (DuPV-3) was found in mallard and American black duck (27.6% estimated prevalence) that was monophyletic with other known DuPVs. A single viral type was identified in Atlantic puffin (PuPV-1, 9.8% estimated prevalence), while a higher genetic diversity was found in other Charadriiformes. Specifically, three types [gull PV-1 (GuPV-1), -2, and -3] were identified in two gull species (estimated prevalence of 17% and 2.6% in American herring and great black-backed gull, respectively), and seven types [kittiwake PV-1 (KiPV-1) through -7] were found in black-legged kittiwake (81.3% estimated prevalence). Significantly higher DuPV-3 circulation was observed in spring compared to fall and in adults compared to juveniles. The studied host species\u2019 tendencies to be in crowded environments likely affect infection rates and their migratory behaviors could explain the high viral diversity, illustrating how host behavior can influence viral ecology and distribution. For DuPV-3, GuPV-1, PuPV-1, and KiPV-2, we obtained the complete genomic sequences, which showed the same organization as other known APVs. Phylogenetic analyses showed evidence for virus\u2013host co-divergence at the host taxonomic levels of family, order, and inter-order, but we also observed that host-specificity constraints are relaxed among highly related hosts as we found cross-species transmission within ducks and within gulls. Furthermore, the phylogeny of viruses infecting the Charadriiformes did not match the host phylogeny and gull viruses formed distinct monophyletic clades with kittiwake viruses, possibly reflecting past host-switching events. Considering the vast PV genotype diversity in other hosts and the large number of bird species, many more APVs likely remain to be discovered.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canuti, Marta; Munro, Hannah J.; Robertson, Gregory J.; Kroyer, Ashley N.

This study aimed to investigate the RSV-associated neurologic manifestations that present with seizures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged less than 15 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infections and seizures between January 2011 and December 2016 in a regional hospital in South Korea. RESULTS: During this period, 1,193 patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were identified. Of these, 35 (35 of 1,193, 2.93%; boys, 19; girls, 16; mean age: 20.8\u00B116.6 months) presented with seizure. Febrile seizure was the most common diagnosis (27 of 35, 77.1%); simple febrile seizures in 13 patients (13 of 27, 48.1%) and complex febrile seizures in 14 (14 of 27, 51.9%). Afebrile seizures without meningitis or encephalopathy were observed in 5 patients (5 of 35, 14.3%), seizures with meningitis in 2 (2 of 35, 5.7%), and seizure with encephalopathy in 1 (1 of 35, 2.9%) patient. Lower respiratory symptoms were not observed in 8 patients. In a patient with encephalopathy, brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed transient changes in white matter, suggesting cytotoxic edema as the mechanism underlying encephalopathy. Most patients recovered with general management, and progression to epilepsy was noted in only 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Although febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure associated with RSV infection, the proportion of patients with complex febrile seizures was higher than that of those with general febrile seizures. Transient cytotoxic edema may be a pathogenic mechanism in RSV-related encephalopathy with seizures.","publish_time":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cha, Teahyen; Choi, Young Jin; Oh, Jae-Won; Kim, Chang-Ryul; Park, Dong Woo; Seol, In Joon; Moon, Jin-Hwa","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/104e60eede9e4016c243f20f4541a33852ea3d1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6477548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6477548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["general febrile seizures","complex febrile seizures","simple febrile seizures","Afebrile seizures","RSV-related encephalopathy","proportion of patients","RSV infections","medical records of patients","common type of seizure","Transient cytotoxic edema","laboratory","meningitis","transient changes","pathogenic mechanism","general management","common diagnosis","Respiratory syncytial virus","Lower respiratory symptoms","brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging","white matter","epilepsy","PURPOSE","years","various neurological complications","girls","regional hospital","South Korea","mean age","progression","months","period","neurologic manifestations","CONCLUSION","boys","METHODS","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To describe and analyse Ebola preparedness activities within the Icelandic healthcare system, and to explore the perspectives and experiences of managers and frontline health workers. Methods: A qualitative case study, based on semi-structured interviews with 21 staff members in the national Ebola Treatment Team, Emergency Room at Landspitali University Hospital, and managers of the response team. Results: Contextual factors such as culture and demography influenced preparedness, and contributed to the positive state of mind of participants, and ingenuity in using available resources for preparedness. While participants believed they were ready to take on the task of Ebola, they also had doubts about the chances of Ebola ever reaching Iceland. Yet, factors such as fear of Ebola and the perceived stigma associated with caring for a potentially infected Ebola patient, influenced the preparation process and resulted in plans for specific precautions by staff to secure the safety of their families. There were also concerns about the teamwork and lack of commitment by some during training. Being a \u2018tiny\u2019 nation was seen as both an asset and a weakness in the preparation process. Honest information sharing and scenario-based training contributed to increased confidence amongst participants in the response plans. Conclusions: Communication and training were important for preparedness of health staff in Iceland, in order to receive, admit, and treat a patient suspected of having Ebola, while doubts prevailed on staff capacity to properly do so. For optimal preparedness, likely scenarios for future global security health threats need to be repeatedly enacted, and areas plagued by poverty and fragile healthcare systems require global support.","publish_time":"2019-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunnlaugsson, Geir; Hauksd\u00F3ttir, \u00CDris Eva; Bygbjerg, Ib Christian; Pinkowski Tersb\u00F8l, Britt","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efd94d1135c5ee11c2af624b344881e079a5ce7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6507955.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6507955/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Landspitali University Hospital"],"locations":["West Africa","Iceland"],"keyphrases":["Ebola preparedness activities","Ebola epidemic","chances of Ebola","task of Ebola","preparedness of health staff","infected Ebola patient","optimal preparedness","worldwide preparedness activities","national Ebola Treatment Team","participants","staff members","global fear","staff capacity","global support","response team","scenario-based training","response plans","preparation process","doubts","future global security health threats","frontline health workers","experiences of managers","Contextual factors","away countries","fragile healthcare systems","Icelandic healthcare system","Emergency Room","likely scenarios","Landspitali University Hospital","semi-structured interviews","increased confidence","West Africa","qualitative case study","poverty","culture","ingenuity","perspectives","demography","specific precautions","Communication","borders","positive state of mind","Honest information","available resources","Methods","asset","Results","areas","lack of commitment","Conclusions","safety","weakness","perceived stigma","Background","teamwork","families","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating a spatial organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the virus\u2019s conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, potentially contributing to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV.","publish_time":"2019-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vahey, Michael D; Fletcher, Daniel A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67e55038298b84f9d71e2e300abcead42e725783.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6516830.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spatial organization of binding","surface of filamentous viruses","sialic acid","receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin","balance","HA","receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase","NA-rich pole","host mucus","cleaving activities","filamentous phenotype","cell surface","underlying cells","clinical isolates of IAV","persistent directional mobility","super-resolution microscopy","diffusion","virus\u2019s conflicting needs","proteins","prevalence","immobilization","Brownian ratchet","genetic aspects","viral envelope","Influenza"],"language":"en"},

To review information on the epidemiology and disease burden of neonatal pertussis in South and Southeast Asian countries, a systematic literature review of three bibliographic databases was undertaken. Peer-reviewed original studies on neonatal pertussis epidemiology and burden published since 2000, with a geographical scope limited to South and Southeast Asian countries, were included. Data were systematically extracted based on parameters defined a priori. Our findings show that the burden of neonatal pertussis and its complications is substantial. An increase in the number of pertussis cases has been noted since early 2000, ranging from 61 to 92.9% in infants 0\u20133 months old. The most common symptoms an infant is likely to present with are cough with or without paroxysms, cyanosis, apnea, tachypnea, difficulty in breathing and leukocytosis. In addition, it can lead to hospitalization (length of stay: 5\u20137 days), complications (e.g., pneumonia, seizures) and mortality ranging from 5.6 to 14.7%. Other observations indicate that diagnosis is challenging because of non-specific clinical symptoms. Specifically, for obstetricians and gynecologists, the information available for making informed decisions on the prevention of neonatal pertussis is unreliable. Maternal immunization against pertussis during late stages of pregnancy has proven to be efficacious and well tolerated. A high burden of neonatal pertussis, as well as its complications, is observed in South and Southeast Asian countries. There is a need to intensify efforts to protect this vulnerable population with maternal vaccination.

However, the mechanisms that govern the AVS are poorly defined. Using a BEAS-2B respiratory epithelial cell line deficient in IRF1, we demonstrate higher susceptibility to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza virus. IRF1-mediated restriction of VSV is IFN-independent, as blockade of types I and III IFNs and JAK-STAT signaling before infection did not affect VSV infection of either parent or IRF1 KO cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that IRF1 regulates constitutive expression of ~300 genes, including antiviral ISGs: OAS2, BST2, and RNASEL and knockdown of any of these IRF1-dependent genes increased VSV infection. Additionally, IRF1 enhances rapid expression of IFN\u03B2 and IFN\u03BB after stimulation with poly I:C and also regulates ISG expression. Mechanistically, IRF1 enhances recruitment of BRD4 to promotor-enhancer regions of ISGs for rapid expression and maintains levels of histone H3K4me1 for optimal constitutive expression. Finally, IRF1 also regulates constitutive expression of TLR2 and TLR3 and promotes signaling through these pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These data reveal multiple roles for IRF1 toward effective anti-viral responses by maintaining IFN-independent constitutive expression of anti-viral ISGs and supporting early IFN-dependent responses to PRR stimulation.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panda, Debasis; Gjinaj, Erisa; Bachu, Mahesh; Squire, Erica; Novatt, Hilary; Ozato, Keiko; Rabin, Ronald L.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3c25b9a548eebd5505b4f20d75fa99a08ab88dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6529937.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["IFN","AVS","VSV","ISG","PRR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IRF1-dependent genes","optimal constitutive expression","constitutive expression of TLR2","VSV infection","ISG expression","IFN-independent constitutive expression of anti-viral ISGs","IRF1-mediated restriction of VSV","IRF1 KO cells","rapid expression of IFN\u03B2","IFN stimulated genes","antiviral ISGs","early IFN-dependent responses","effective anti-viral responses","Viral defense","PRR stimulation","AVS","promotor-enhancer regions of ISGs","influenza virus","antiviral state","vesicular stomatitis virus","B respiratory epithelial cell line deficient","levels of histone H3K4me1","interferons","higher susceptibility","multiple roles","BST2","mucosal sites","OAS2","IFN\u03BB","parent","recruitment of BRD4","IFNs","BEAS","poly","blockade of types","TLR3","JAK-STAT","pattern recognition receptors","Transcriptome analysis","RNASEL","knockdown","data","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about viruses in devils and whether any are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species. Using both metagenomics based on virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (virion-enriched metagenomics) and metatranscriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes of captive and wild devils. A total of 54 fecal samples collected from two captive and four wild populations were processed for virome characterization using both approaches. In total, 24 novel marsupial-related viruses, comprising a sapelovirus, astroviruses, rotaviruses, picobirnaviruses, parvoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, and a gammaherpesvirus, were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2. Captive devils showed significantly lower viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two virus discovery approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with metatranscriptomics better suited for RNA viruses and virion-enriched metagenomics largely identifying more DNA viruses. Thus, the viral communities revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. An integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics constitutes a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities within a sample. IMPORTANCE The Tasmanian devil is an iconic Australian marsupial that has suffered an 80% population decline due to a contagious cancer, devil facial tumor disease, along with other threats. Until now, viral discovery in this species has been confined to one gammaherpesvirus (dasyurid herpesvirus 2 [DaHV-2]), for which captivity was identified as a significant risk factor. Our discovery of 24 novel marsupial-associated RNA and DNA viruses, and that viral diversity is lower in captive than in wild devils, has greatly expanded our knowledge of gut-associated viruses in devils and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. Our results also revealed that a combination of virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach for virome characterization than either method alone. Our results thus provide a springboard for continuous improvements in the way we study complex viral communities.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Rowena; Shi, Mang; Grueber, Catherine E.; Holmes, Edward C.; Hogg, Carolyn J.; Belov, Katherine; Barrs, Vanessa R.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3df56c2e76799309cc7bdbc5ef8f968a1569a08c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532096.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virion-enriched metagenomics","RNA viruses","Captive devils","metatranscriptomics","associated viruses","DNA viruses","wild devils","types of viruses","viruses present","viral discovery","novel marsupial-related viruses","virion enrichment","combination of virion","lower viral diversity","complex viral communities","Tasmanian devil","captive management","endangered species","novel marsupial-associated RNA","devil facial tumor disease","functional profiles of viral communities","endangered carnivorous marsupial","fecal viromes of captive","wild populations","virus discovery approaches","iconic Australian marsupial","hemorrhagic disease virus","comprehensive approach","virome characterization","integrated approach","gammaherpesvirus","DFTD","total","results","bulk RNA sequencing","fecal samples","potential conservation relevance","known mammalian pathogens","sequence-independent amplification","picobirnaviruses","substantial differences","way","powerful tool","parvoviruses","rotaviruses","papillomaviruses","astroviruses","sapelovirus","contagious cancer","number","complete overview","important baseline information","continuous improvements","springboard","polyomaviruses","knowledge of gut","dasyurid herpesvirus","DaHV","IMPORTANCE","Comparison","method","significant risk factor","captivity","research","threats"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease\u2014travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling. METHODS: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. RESULTS: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information.

The distal airway stem/progenitor cells (DASCs) have been shown to have potent regenerative capacity after lung injury. In this work, we aimed to define the role of mouse DASCs (mDASCs) in response to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. METHODS: The mDASCs were isolated, expanded in vitro, and labeled with GFP by lentiviral infection. The labeled mDASCs were intratracheally instilled into bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice on day 7. Pathological change, collagen content, \u03B1-SMA expression, lung function, and mortality rate were assessed at 7, 14, and 21 days after bleomycin administration. Tissue section and direct fluorescence staining was used to show the distribution and differentiation of mDASCs in lung. RESULTS: The transplanted mDASCs could incorporate, proliferate, and differentiate into type I pneumocytes in bleomycin-injured lung. They also inhibited fibrogenesis by attenuating the deposition of collagen and expression of \u03B1-SMA. In addition, mDASCs improved pulmonary function and reduce mortality in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice.

Here we discovered that bat cells are more resistant than human and mouse cells to DNA damage induced by genotoxic drugs. We found that bat cells accumulate less chemical than human and mouse cells, and efficient drug efflux mediated by the ABC transporter ABCB1 underlies this improved response to genotoxic reagents. Inhibition of ABCB1 triggers an accumulation of doxorubicin, DNA damage, and cell death. ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels in several cell lines and tissues derived from bats compared to humans. Furthermore, increased drug efflux and high expression of ABCB1 are conserved across multiple bat species. Our findings suggest that enhanced efflux protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds, which may contribute to their low cancer incidence.","publish_time":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koh, Javier; Itahana, Yoko; Mendenhall, Ian H.; Low, Dolyce; Soh, Eunice Xin Yi; Guo, Alvin Kunyao; Chionh, Yok Teng; Wang, Lin-Fa; Itahana, Koji","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a83b707bc3b8aa86193f85b31b70a2dc5536ca3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4a394fcf8d7f5c197eafd8203d05d1fd84a78eed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6597548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat cells","mouse cells","DNA damage","Bats","Inhibition of ABCB1","efficient drug efflux","enhanced efflux","increased drug efflux","ABC transporter ABCB1","high expression of ABCB1","genotoxic reagents","genotoxic drugs","genotoxic compounds","multiple bat species","low incidence of cancer","low cancer incidence","cell lines","cell death","improved response","tissues","accumulation of doxorubicin","higher levels","ability","mechanisms","unusual mammals","addition","findings","long lifespans","phenomenon","humans"],"language":"en"},

Y2H allows identification of protein interaction partners using screening libraries, while RY2H is used to determine residues critical to a given protein\u2013protein interaction by exploiting site-directed mutagenesis. Currently, both these techniques still rely on sequencing of positive clones using conventional Sanger sequencing. For Y2H, a screen can yield several positives; the identification of such clones is further complicated by the fact that sequencing products usually contain vector sequence. For RY2H, obtaining a complete sequence is required to identify the full range of residues involved in protein\u2013protein interactions. However, with Sanger sequencing limited to 500\u2013800 nucleotides, sequencing is usually carried from both ends for clones greater than this length. Analysis of such RY2H data thus requires assembly of sequencing products combined with trimming of vector sequences and of low-quality bases at the beginning and ends of sequencing products. Further, RY2H analysis requires collation of mutations that abrogate a DB/AD interaction. Here, we present 2HybridTools, a Java program with a user-friendly interface that allows addressing all these issues inherent to both Y2H and RY2H. Specifically, for Y2H, 2HybridTools enables automated identification of positive clones, while for RY2H, 2HybridTools provides detailed mutation reports as a basis for further investigation of given protein\u2013protein interactions.","publish_time":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cauchy, Pierre; Kahn-Perl\u00E8s, Brigitte; Ferrier, Pierre; Imbert, Jean; L\u00E9cine, Patrick","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6612259.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DB/AD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein interactions","powerful protein","identification of protein interaction partners","RY2H analysis","sequencing of positive clones","protein interaction screening methods","investigation of given protein","RY2H data","assembly of sequencing products","AD interaction","conventional Sanger sequencing","interaction of bait","HybridTools","automated identification of positive clones","clones greater","DB","ends","screening libraries","residues critical","range of residues","complete sequence","trimming of vector sequences","DNA binding","basis","prey proteins","detailed mutation reports","low-quality bases","activation domains","collation of mutations","Java program","beginning","fact","site","user-friendly interface","issues inherent","length","positives","mutagenesis","Yeast","techniques","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Ebola GP2 plays a critical role in virus entry and has similarities in mechanism and structure to the HIV gp41 protein for which inhibitors have been successfully developed. In this work, a putative binding pocket for the C-terminal heptad repeat in the N-terminal heptad repeat trimer was targeted for identification of small molecules that arrest EBOV-host membrane fusion. Two computational structure-based virtual screens of \u223C1.7 M compounds were performed (DOCK program) against a GP2 five-helix bundle, resulting in 165 commercially available compounds purchased for experimental testing. Based on assessment of inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, and target specificity, four promising candidates emerged with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the 3 to 26 \u03BCM range. Molecular dynamics simulations of the two most potent candidates in their DOCK-predicted binding poses indicate that the majority of favorable interactions involve seven highly conserved residues that can be used to guide further inhibitor development and refinement targeting EBOV. IMPORTANCE The most recent Ebola virus disease outbreak, from 2014 to 2016, resulted in approximately 28,000 individuals becoming infected, which led to over 12,000 causalities worldwide. The particularly high pathogenicity of the virus makes paramount the identification and development of promising lead compounds to serve as inhibitors of Ebola infection. To limit viral load, the virus-host membrane fusion event can be targeted through the inhibition of the class I fusion glycoprotein of Ebolavirus. In the current work, several promising small-molecule inhibitors that target the glycoprotein GP2 were identified through systematic application of structure-based computational and experimental drug design procedures.","publish_time":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singleton, Courtney D.; Humby, Monica S.; Yi, Hyun Ah; Rizzo, Robert C.; Jacobs, Amy","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2445316a3475f25e869fa303d9ec90f8739d40f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6639268.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639268/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola GP2","viral glycoprotein","host-viral membrane fusion","glycoprotein GP2","EBOV-host membrane fusion","virus-host membrane fusion event","virus entry","fusion glycoprotein of Ebolavirus","inhibitors of Ebola infection","promising candidates","computational structure","viral load","viral genome","recent Ebola virus disease outbreak","promising small-molecule inhibitors","development of promising lead compounds","available compounds","identification of small molecules","C-terminal heptad","N-terminal heptad","systematic application of structure","binding poses","potent candidates","inhibitor development","experimental testing","target specificity","current work","DOCK program","putative binding pocket","assessment of inhibitory activity","inhibitory concentration values","experimental drug design procedures","replication cycle","conformational changes","subsequent release","mechanism","paramount","critical role","cytotoxicity","similarities","trimer","HIV gp41 protein","majority of favorable interactions","class","inhibition","IMPORTANCE","virtual screens","key step","conserved residues","Molecular dynamics simulations","high pathogenicity","refinement","helix bundle","\u03BCM range","individuals","causalities"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This is a retrospective epidemiological study of adult patients with hMPV severe CAP admitted to ICU during a ten-year period with admission PSI score \u2265 3. RESULTS: The 92.8% of the 28 patients with severe CAP due to human metapneumovirus were detected during the first half of the year. Median age was 62 years and 60.7% were male. The genotyping of isolated human metapneumovirus showed group B predominance (60.7%). All patients had acute respiratory failure. Median APACHE II and SOFA score were 13 and 6.55, respectively. The 25% were coinfected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. 60.7% of the patients had shock at admission and 50% underwent mechanical ventilation. Seven patients developed ARDS, three of them younger than 60 years and without comorbidities. Mortality in ICU was 14.3%. Among survivors, ICU and hospital stay were 6.5 and 14 days, respectively. Plasma levels of procalcitonin were higher in patients with bacterial coinfection (18.2 vs 0.54; p \u003C 0.05). The levels of C-reactive protein, however, were similar. CONCLUSION: Human metapneumovirus was associated with severe CAP requiring ICU admission among elderly patients or patients with comorbidities, but also in healthy young subjects. These patients often underwent mechanical ventilation with elevated health resource consumption. While one out of four patients showed pneumococcal coinfection, plasma procalcitonin helped to implement antimicrobial stewardship.

A particular concern is that this vaccine evolution could reduce its antigenicity\u2014the immunity elicited to the transgene. We use mathematical and computational models to study vaccine evolution and immunity. These models include evolution arising during the process of manufacture, the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth, plus innate and adaptive immunity elicited during the course of infection. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the short period of within-host growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant growth may only weakly interfere with vaccine growth in the host and thus have a limited effect on immunity to vaccine. Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes compromise vaccine immunity, but only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe, and this evolution can be easily avoided or mitigated.","publish_time":"2019-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bull, James J.; Nuismer, Scott L.; Antia, Rustom","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1aff1d1cda60a3215266ed6d56288d5b3630c50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6668849.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6668849/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine immunity","vaccine growth","host vaccine evolution","vaccine manufacture","study vaccine evolution","dynamics of vaccine","vaccine revertants","selective basis of vaccine evolution","vaccine virus population","extent of evolution","host growth","revertant growth","adaptive immunity","course of host infection","process of manufacture","viral population","foreign transgene","course of infection","competent viral vector backbone","perspective of viral replication","computational models","limited effect","recombinant vector vaccines","short period","opportunity","particular concern","antigenicity","immunological consequences","complication"],"language":"en"},

In influenza A and B, AM2 and BM2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. By contrast, M2 proteins in influenza C and D, CM2 and DM2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. These differences point to different biological roles for M2 in types A and B versus C and D, which is also reflected in their sequences. AM2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, where mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality, and relative low conductance are beginning to be understood. The present review summarizes the biochemical and structural aspects of influenza viroporins and discusses the most relevant aspects of function, inhibition, and interaction with the host.","publish_time":"2019-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Janet; Torres, Jaume","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2efa5dad7a6606eece48c0c389fdd45b2f7c90e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza C","influenza types","influenza virus types","seasonal influenza epidemics","structural aspects of influenza viroporins","M2 proteins","B viruses","seasonal epidemics","proton channels","membrane permeability","contagious virus","AM2","humans","virus-infected cells","proton selectivity","ion channels","small proteins","class of viroporins","present review","relevant aspects of function","unidirectionality","mechanistic details","acid activation","rationale","best characterized viroporin","inhibition","different biological roles","relative low conductance","DM2","BM2","CM2","date","contrast","unpredictable pandemics","interaction","differences","chloride ions","host","monovalent cations","flu infections","protons","sequences"],"language":"en"},

In the experiment, we immunized four groups of piglets with two commercial inactivated (A1\u2014Progressis, A2\u2014Suivac) and two modified live vaccines (B3\u2014Amervac, B4\u2014Porcilis). Twenty-one days after the final vaccination, all piglets, including the control non-immunized group (C5), were i.n., infected with the Lelystad strain of PRRS virus. The serum antibody response (IgM and IgG) was the strongest in group A1 followed by two MLV (B3 and B4) groups. Locally, we demonstrated the highest level of IgG antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavages (BALF), and saliva in group A1, whereas low IgA antibody responses in BALF and feces were detected in all groups. We have found virus neutralization antibody at DPV 21 (days post vaccination) and higher levels in all groups including the control at DPI 21 (days post infection). Positive antigen specific cell-mediated response in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was observed in groups B3 and B4 at DPV 7 and in group B4 at DPV 21 and in all intervals after infection. The IFN-\u03B3 producing lymphocytes after antigen stimulation were found in CD4(\u2212)CD8(\u002B) and CD4(\u002B)CD8(\u002B) subsets of all immunized groups 7 days after infection. After infection, there were obvious differences in virus excretion. The virus was detected in all groups of piglets in serum, saliva, and occasionally in feces at DPI 3. Significantly lower virus load was found in groups A1 and B3 at DPI 21. Negative samples appeared at DPI 21 in B3 group in saliva. It can be concluded that antibodies after immunization and infection, and the virus after infection can be detected in all the compartments monitored. Immunization with inactivated vaccine A1\u2014Progressis induces high levels of antibodies produced both systemically and locally. Immunization with MLV-vaccines (Amervac and Porcilis) produces sufficient antibody levels and also cell-mediated immunity. After infection virus secretion gradually decreases in group B3, indicating tendency to induce sterile immunity.","publish_time":"2019-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toman, Miroslav; Celer, Vladimir; Kavanov\u00E1, Lenka; Lev\u00E1, Lenka; Frolichova, Jitka; Ondr\u00E1\u010Dkov\u00E1, Petra; Kudl\u00E1\u010Dkov\u00E1, Hana; Nechv\u00E1talov\u00E1, Kate\u0159ina; Salat, Jiri; Faldyna, Martin","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/166ac544dda68154d0cfb96da75f30e457d6eda2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6691355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPV","DPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["groups B3","groups A1","B3 group","group B3","group A1","groups of piglets","immunized groups","infection virus secretion","group B4","virus neutralization antibody","virus excretion","days post infection","serum antibody response","lower virus load","sufficient antibody levels","antibody production","cell mediated immunity","cell-mediated immunity","DPV","control non-immunized group","saliva","immunization","Lelystad strain of PRRS virus","inactivated vaccine A1","days post vaccination","MLV-vaccines","high levels of antibodies","modified live vaccines","Positive antigen specific cell-mediated response","Progressis","low IgA antibody responses","Amervac","BALF","higher levels","immune response","Porcilis","highest level of IgG antibodies","sterile immunity","feces","CD4","CD8","antigen stimulation","final vaccination","local level","lymphocyte transformation test","bronchoalveolar lavages","LTT","Suivac","A2","IgM","lymphocytes","C5","obvious differences","tendency","subsets","IFN-\u03B3","study","intervals","Negative samples","goals","experiment","compartments"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the global activity within this rapidly developing field and to identify particular areas of focus that are of current relevance to the MGBA during the last decade (2009\u20132018). METHODS: The current study uses the Scopus for data collection. We used the key terms \u201Cmicrobiome-gut-brain axis\u201D and its synonyms because we are concerned with MGBA per se as a new concept in research rather than related topics. A VOSviewer version 1.6.11 was used to visualize collaboration pattern between countries and authors, and evolving research topics by analysis of the term co-occurrence in the title and abstract of publications. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, there were 51,504 published documents related to the microbiome, including 1713 articles related to the MGBA: 829 (48.4%) original articles, 658(38.4%) reviews, and 226 (13.2%) other articles such as notes, editorials or letters. The USA took the first place with 385 appearances, followed by Ireland (n = 161), China (n = 155), and Canada (n = 144).The overall citation h-index was 106, and the countries with the highest h-index values were the USA (69), Ireland (58), and Canada (43). The cluster analysis demonstrated that the dominant fields of the MGBA include four clusters with four research directions: \u201Cmodeling MGBA in animal systems\u201D, \u201Cinterplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system\u201D, \u201Cirritable bowel syndrome related to gut microbiota\u201D, and \u201Cneurodegenerative diseases related to gut microbiota\u201D. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the research on the MGBA has been becoming progressively more extensive at global level over the past 10 years. Overall, our study found that a large amount of work on MGBA focused on immunomodulation, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite considerable progress illustrating the communication between the gut microbiome and the brain over the past 10 years, many issues remain about their relevance for therapeutic intervention of many diseases.","publish_time":"2019-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.; Smale, Simon; Waring, W.

Diagnosis usually relies on antibody screening by point-of-care tests (POCT), e.g., by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and confirmation using Western blot (WB). We increasingly observed ELISA-negative, WB-positive samples and aimed to substantiate these observations using 1194 serum/plasma samples collected from 1998 to 2019 primarily from FIV-suspect cats. While 441 samples tested positive and 375 tested negative by ELISA and WB, 81 samples had discordant results: 70 were false ELISA-negative (WB-positive) and 11 were false ELISA-positive (WB-negative); 297 ambiguous results were not analyzed further. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA (82% and 91%, respectively) were lower than those reported in 1995 (98% and 97%, respectively). The diagnostic efficiency was reduced from 97% to 86%. False ELISA-negative samples originated mainly (54%) from Switzerland (1995: 0%). Sixty-four false ELISA-negative samples were available for POCT (SNAP(TM)/WITNESS(R)): five were POCT-positive. FIV RT-PCR was positive for two of these samples and was weakly positive for two ELISA- and POCT-negative samples. Low viral loads prohibited sequencing. Our results suggest that FIV diagnosis has become more challenging, probably due to increasing travel by cats and the introduction of new FIV isolates not recognized by screening assays.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frankenfeld, Julia; Meili, Theres; Meli, Marina L.; Riond, Barbara; Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A.

Some of this extremely broad variation in susceptibility is explained by the size of the initial inoculum or the influenza exposure history of the individual; some is explained by generic host factors, such as frailty, that decrease resilience following any systemic insult. Some demographic factors (pregnancy, obesity, and advanced age) appear to confer a more specific susceptibility to severe illness following infection with influenza viruses. As with other infectious diseases, a substantial component of susceptibility is determined by host genetics. Several genetic susceptibility variants have now been reported with varying levels of evidence. Susceptible hosts may have impaired intracellular controls of viral replication (e.g. IFITM3, TMPRS22 variants), defective interferon responses (e.g. GLDC, IRF7/9 variants), or defects in cell-mediated immunity with increased baseline levels of systemic inflammation (obesity, pregnancy, advanced age). These mechanisms may explain the prolonged viral replication reported in critically ill patients with influenza: patients with life-threatening disease are, by definition, abnormal hosts. Understanding these molecular mechanisms of susceptibility may in the future enable the design of host-directed therapies to promote resilience.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clohisey, Sara; Baillie, John Kenneth","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4af17957d9f05a4c669136e67234a438c12880d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6729070.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6729070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic susceptibility variants","specific susceptibility","molecular mechanisms of susceptibility","substantial component of susceptibility","obesity","TMPRS22 variants","pregnancy","influenza viruses","generic host factors","design of host","advanced age","host genetics","resilience","prolonged viral replication","influenza exposure history","ill patients","severe illness","critical illness","systemic insult","Susceptible hosts","abnormal hosts","demographic factors","impaired intracellular controls of viral replication","increased baseline levels of systemic inflammation","varying levels of evidence","cell-mediated immunity","defective interferon responses","IFITM3","infection","initial inoculum","GLDC","life-threatening disease","definition","individual","IRF7","defects","frailty","future","new flu virus","infectious diseases","people","small minority","size","therapies","symptoms","broad variation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We employed solid phase immunoassay techniques to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies to EBV virions and defined proteins in 432 individuals with schizophrenia and 311 individuals without a history of a psychiatric disorder. Western blot testing was performed to document reactivity to specific EBV proteins. Polygenic risk for schizophrenia was calculated from genome sequencing arrays. Levels of antibodies between the groups were compared by multivariate analyses incorporating clinical, genetic, and demographic measures. RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia had marked elevations in the levels of antibodies to EBV virions as compared to the control population. Further analyses indicated increased levels of reactivity to EBV-viral capsid antibody (VCA) but not to EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) or to other human herpesviruses. Western blot analysis confirmed increased reactivity to VCA proteins in the group of individuals with schizophrenia and documented a lack of increased levels of antibodies to EBNA-1. Genetic analyses indicated an additive effect of increased levels of antibodies to EBV virions and genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, with individuals with elevated levels of both type of markers having a greater than 8.5-fold odds of a schizophrenia diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with schizophrenia have increased levels of antibodies to some but not all EBV proteins indicating an aberrant response to EBV infection. This aberrant response may contribute to the immunopathology of schizophrenia and related disorders.","publish_time":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dickerson, Faith; Jones-Brando, Lorraine; Ford, Glen; Genovese, Giulio; Stallings, Cassie; Origoni, Andrea; O\u2019Dushlaine, Colm; Katsafanas, Emily; Sweeney, Kevin; Khushalani, Sunil; Yolken, Robert","journal":"Schizophr Bull","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d1e0bb8a0e112cde902fbbe768c61526ad6eb04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6737467.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6737467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV virions","EBV infection","increased levels of reactivity","lack of increased levels of antibodies","specific EBV proteins","immunopathology of schizophrenia","schizophrenia diagnosis","increased reactivity","additive effect of increased levels of antibodies","elevated levels","EBV nuclear antigen","class antibodies","group of individuals","VCA proteins","EBV-viral capsid antibody","Genetic analyses","defined proteins","document reactivity","genetic susceptibility","multivariate analyses","aberrant response","EBNA","Western blot analysis","Western blot testing","persistent infection","human herpesviruses","prevalent human herpesvirus capable","immunoglobulin G","IgG","central nervous system","solid phase immunoassay techniques","type of markers","fold odds","Epstein","Barr virus","history","groups","elevations","genome sequencing arrays","BACKGROUND","METHODS","demographic measures","related disorders","psychiatric disorder","Polygenic risk","control population","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

A systematic literature search from 10 databases was conducted and screened for relevant articles. Studies reporting information about the treatment of MERS coronavirus infection were extracted and analyzed. Despite receiving treatment with ribavirin plus IFN, the case fatality rate was as high as 71% in the IFN\u2010treatment group and exactly the same in patients who received supportive treatment only. Having chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased the risk of mortality (P \u003C .05), and chronic renal disease is the best parameter to predict the mortality.

A little Triton X-100 can protect Hb from the effects of ribavirin.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Tianqing","journal":"Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be4dc027916ccb353a04375ddebeb2d836ca74f5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1872150808600297; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872150808600297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["morphology of Hb","concentration of Triton X","Hb surface","little Triton X","fluorescence spectrum","Abstract Effects of Triton X","stronger interaction of Triton X","effects of ribavirin","fluorescence polarization","synchronous fluorescence intensity","intrinsic fluorescence intensity","zeta potential","controlled release of ribavirin","Vis spectrum","image morphology","H2O system","increase of concentration","conductivity","HPLC","high-performance liquid chromatographic","methods of UV","properties of hemoglobin","mol"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC guidelines. METHODS: Policies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB were examined. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected. RESULTS: Uniform recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator). However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations. Amongst the nine countries reviewed, there are variations in the recommendations for all three diseases. While, some countries align with the WHO recommendations, others align with those made by the CDC. The choice of respirator and the level of filtering ability vary amongst the guidelines and the different diseases. Lastly, none of the policies discuss reuse, extended use or the use of cloth masks. CONCLUSION: Currently, there are significant variations in the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and TB. These differences may reflect the scarcity of level-one evidence available to inform policy development. The lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks, despite widespread use in many low and middle-income countries, remains a policy gap. Health organizations and countries should jointly evaluate the available evidence, prioritize research to inform evidence gaps, and develop consistent policy on masks and respirator use in the health care setting.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f7b6af5cd76098945fd076e4fa43a541fb7a5a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3693993.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23725338/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-6-216","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respirator use","use of masks","mask use","widespread use","extended use","use of cloth masks","CDC guidelines","low risk situations","high risk situations","respirators","middle-income countries","prevention of influenza","choice of respirator","evidence available","available evidence","available policies","high-income countries","evidence gaps","HCWs","SARS","TB","Uniform recommendations","limited evidence","seasonal influenza","pandemic influenza","Health organizations","health care workers","health care setting","consistent policy","World Health Organization","policy gap","policy development","prevention of respiratory infections","scarcity of level","significant variations","different diseases","level of filtering ability","protection","Center","ongoing debate","Disease Control","research","reuse","areas of consistency","reference","differences","RESULTS","study","METHODS","lack","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the most important initiative to monitor and regulate the international trade of wildlife but its credibility is dependent on the quality of the trade data. We report on the performance of CITES reporting by focussing on the commercial trade in non-native reptiles and amphibians into Thailand as to illustrate trends, species composition and numbers of wild-caught vs. captive-bred specimens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on data in the WCMC-CITES trade database, we establish that a total of 75,594 individuals of 169 species of reptiles and amphibians (including 27 globally threatened species) were imported into Thailand in 1990\u20132007. The majority of individuals (59,895, 79%) were listed as captive-bred and a smaller number (15,699, 21%) as wild-caught. In the 1990s small numbers of individuals of a few species were imported into Thailand, but in 2003 both volumes and species diversity increased rapidly. The proportion of captive-bred animals differed greatly between years (from 0 to \u003E80%). Wild-caught individuals were mainly sourced from African countries, and captive-bred individuals from Asian countries (including from non-CITES Parties). There were significant discrepancies between exports and imports. Thailand reports the import of \u003E10,000 individuals (51 species) originating from Kazakhstan, but Kazakhstan reports no exports of these species. Similar discrepancies, involving smaller numbers (\u003E100 individuals of 9 species), can be seen in the import of reptiles into Thailand via Macao. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: While there has been an increase in imports of amphibian and reptiles into Thailand, erratic patterns in proportions of captive-bred specimens and volumes suggests either capricious markets or errors in reporting. Large discrepancies with respect to origin point to misreporting or possible violations of the rules and intentions of CITES.","publish_time":"2011-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nijman, Vincent; Shepherd, Chris R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/048b240dcabbd623a6cda8c4236ea50d7961315c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3064566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21464976/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017825","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Thailand","Kazakhstan","Macao"],"keyphrases":["species of reptiles","Thailand","captive-bred individuals","species composition","threatened species","species diversity","captive-bred specimens","majority of individuals","Endangered Species of Wild Fauna","International wildlife trade","international trade of wildlife","commercial trade","trade database","numbers of wild","proportions of captive","proportion of captive","bred animals","import of reptiles","s small numbers of individuals","non-native reptiles","smaller numbers","amphibians","volumes","Large discrepancies","significant discrepancies","Similar discrepancies","exports","Kazakhstan","Asian countries","African countries","imports of amphibian","origin point","possible violations","misreporting","erratic patterns","capricious markets","respect","credibility","trends","leading threats","rules","errors","quality","Flora","Convention","biodiversity conservation","intentions","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","increase","WCMC","BACKGROUND","total","Macao","METHODOLOGY","Parties","years","important initiative","CONCLUSION","SIGNIFICANCE","performance"],"language":"en"},

Evidence shows that chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11 and their receptor CXCR3 are involved in severity of dengue, but their genetic association with the susceptibility of vascular leakage during dengue infection has not been reported. We genotyped 14 common variants of these candidate genes in 176 patients infected with dengue. rs4859584 and rs8878 (CXCL10) were significantly associated with vascular permeability of dengue infection (P \u003C0.05); while variants of CXCL11 showed moderate significance of association (P =0.0527). Haplotype blocks were constructed for genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 (5 and 7 common variants respectively). Haplotype association tests performed revealed that, \u201CCCCCA\u201D of gene CXCL10 and \u201CAGTTTAC\u201D of CXCL11 were found to be significantly associated with vascular leakage (P =0.0154 and 0.0366 respectively).

PED virus (PEDV) spreads by fecal\u2013oral contact and can be prevented by oral immunization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective oral vaccine against PEDV infection. Currently, Bacillus subtilis as recombinant vaccine carrier has been used for antigen delivery and proved well in immune effect and safety. The present study evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis-RC) in piglets via oral administration. After oral immunization in piglets, B. subtilis-RC significantly increased the local mucosal immune responses. Oral administration with B. subtilis-RC significantly improved the level of specific mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against PEDV infection, through enlarging the area of Peyer\u2019s patches (PPs) and increasing the number of ileum IgA(\u002B) secreting (SIgA) cells. In the meantime, B. subtilis-RC remarkably increased the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). We also observed that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC significantly increased CD3(\u002B)T lymphocytes\u2019 numbers and up-regulated the ratio of CD4(\u002B)/CD8(\u002B) T cells. Furthermore, high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against PEDV infection. In summary, our study demonstrated that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC could trigger a high level of local and systemic immune responses and would be a promising candidate vaccine against PEDV infection in piglets.","publish_time":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jialu; Huang, Lulu; Mou, Chunxiao; Zhang, En; Wang, Yongheng; Cao, Yanan; Yang, Qian","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5caced13bcb8a42cca41369c5a71ae7df5381ca8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6418403.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20182028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. subtilis-RC"],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subtilis-RC","oral administration of","oral immunization","PEDV infection","oral contact","effective oral vaccine","immunogenicity of recombinant Bacillus subtilis","systemic immune responses","newborn piglets","local mucosal immune responses","immune effect","satisfactory systemic immune response","level of specific mucosal immunoglobulin","high level of local","recombinant vaccine carrier","increased CD3","T cells","promising candidate vaccine","number of ileum IgA","high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin G","PED virus","present study","number of intraepithelial lymphocytes","T lymphocytes\u2019 numbers","IgG","spreads","substantial economic losses","antibodies","contagious disease","PPs","secreting","antigen delivery","area of Peyer\u2019s patches","world","Porcine epidemic diarrhea","IELs","CD8","SIgA","ratio of CD4","safety","summary","meantime"],"language":"en"},

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3\u201310 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6 hours to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC detection of EBOV for global health care. We propose that adopting miniaturized electrochemical EBOV immunosensing can detect virus level at pM concentration within ~40 minute compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaushik, Ajeet; Tiwari, Sneham; Jayant, Rahul Dev; Marty, Aileen; Nair, Madhavan","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af5ecba4221c135d7cb8339b585f1d17997bbd7f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ad6b423b6a2d68885f3802c8f5b8f9b25aa3e0a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4601610.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566315303651; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4601610?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566315303651; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26319169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","EBOV","RT/Q","POC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola infection","Ebola virus disease","related Ebola virus","rapid diagnostics","Ebola outbreak","virus level","sensitive POC detection of EBOV","review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics","EVD epidemic","fatal EBOV infection stage","global health care","unavailability of rapid diagnostic","rapid blood tests","RNA detection","miniaturized electrochemical EBOV immunosensing","days of ELISA test","diagnostics time","therapeutics","World Health Organization","severe global economic burden","selective sensor","infected animals","paper-based immunoassay methods","public health emergency of international concern","body fluids of infected person","severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome","objects","antibodies capture","patients","point","antigen","Zaire","pM concentration","direct contact","Q-PCR","art","nM levels","minute","delay","hours","therapeutic approaches","antibody response","nanotechnology","onset of symptoms","state","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

The adoption of industrial practices and the introduction of new costly molecular techniques raise the possibility that non-microbiological functions of laboratory management could be left to management professionals. This remains highly controversial; the advantages must be contrasted with the potential to disrupt the traditional managerial responsibility of the microbiologist and the links between the laboratory and clinical staff. Managers and healthcare professionals must resolve this issue, perhaps with the support of the ESCMID. Views varied, according to current professional arrangements and size of the laboratory and population served, on whether there should be a common laboratory for microbiology and other pathology disciplines with joint access to new high-technology techniques, or whether microbiology must continue as a separate facility. Clinical microbiology and infection control were viewed as core services that must be present even in smaller hospitals. Larger community hospitals and teaching centres require a full complement of expertise in laboratory and clinical practice. Integration of these disciplines within a department of infection is an emerging concept. A concern was the shortfall in trained expertise because of the ageing nature of current specialists. The importance of recruiting talented new graduates was emphasised. The importance of this topic led to a recommendation that an ESCMID working party be established to investigate the current arrangements of infection services in Europe and to make recommendations for the future organisation.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finch, R.; Hryniewicz, W.; Van Eldere, J.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15300240; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15300240","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["common laboratory","diagnostic laboratory facilities","ABSTRACT Clinical microbiology","quality laboratory-based infection service","current arrangements of infection services","department of infection","infection control","clinical staff","clinical practice","non-microbiological functions of laboratory management","current professional arrangements","management professionals","importance","ESCMID","new high-technology techniques","talented new graduates","introduction of new costly molecular techniques","pathology disciplines","trained expertise","complement of expertise","ageing nature of current specialists","core services","smaller hospitals","healthcare professionals","strong professional interaction","Larger community hospitals","possibility","joint access","teaching centres","microbiologist","links","Europe","size","traditional managerial responsibility","potential","recommendations","shortfall","adoption of industrial practices","clinicians","physical presence","issue","concern","emerging concept","party","advantages","future organisation","support","topic","Managers","Integration","separate facility","population","Views"],"language":"en"},

The replicative machinery used by the virus is based on few enzymes including a methyltransferase, located in the N-terminal domain of the NS5 protein. Flaviviral methyltransferases are involved in the last two steps of the mRNA capping process, transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine onto the N7 position of the cap guanine (guanine-N7 methyltransferase) and the ribose 2\u2032O position of the first nucleotide following the cap guanine (nucleoside-2\u2032O methyltransferase). The RNA capping process is crucial for mRNA stability, protein synthesis and virus replication. Such an essential function makes methyltransferases attractive targets for the design of antiviral drugs. In this context, starting from the crystal structure of Wesselsbron flavivirus methyltransferase, we elaborated a mechanistic model describing protein/RNA interaction during N7 methyl transfer. Next we used an in silico docking procedure to identify commercially available compounds that would display high affinity for the methyltransferase active site. The best candidates selected were tested in vitro to assay their effective inhibition on 2\u2032O and N7 methyltransferase activities on Wesselsbron and Dengue virus (Dv) methyltransferases. The results of such combined computational and experimental screening approach led to the identification of a high-potency inhibitor.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milani, Mario; Mastrangelo, Eloise; Bollati, Michela; Selisko, Barbara; Decroly, Etienne; Bouvet, Micka\u00EBl; Canard, Bruno; Bolognesi, Martino","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7b3663559b1af765ae7a9363aab7795ac66c685.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127253.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501254/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209002472; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209002472; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.03.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O methyltransferase","guanine-N7 methyltransferase","N7 methyltransferase activities","N7 position","methyltransferase active site","Dengue virus","cap guanine","O position","N7 methyl transfer","crystal structure of Wesselsbron flavivirus methyltransferase","mRNA capping process","protein synthesis","NS5 protein","virus replication","Flaviviral methyltransferases","methyltransferases attractive targets","mRNA stability","RNA interaction","methyl group","high affinity","high-potency inhibitor","identification","causative agents of severe diseases","available compounds","experimental screening approach","mechanistic model","nucleotide","nucleoside","design of antiviral drugs","S-adenosyl","essential function","N-terminal domain","methionine","Dv","ribose","silico docking procedure","Abstract Flaviviruses","Yellow fever","results","steps","effective inhibition","context","replicative machinery","enzymes","best candidates"],"language":"en"},

Because ZIKV uses glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack of information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains derived from different cells. ZIKV E proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, hybrid- and complex-N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell-surface glycans correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we discovered that ZIKV N-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN mediate cell entry of ZIKV.

This study uses a Markov-switching model (MSM) proposed by Hamilton (1989) to analyze the Taiwanese tourist hotel industry cycle. The MSM decomposes the tourist hotel industry cycle into two distinct states: high-growth and low-growth (HGS and LGS). The mean growth rate of HGS is 1.5% and the average growth rate of LGS is 0.07% during the period from December 1999 to February 2011. The corresponding standard deviations in the two regimes are 0.008% and 0.038%, implying that HGS is more stable than LGS. Moreover, the probability of staying in HGS is 94% and the probability of remaining in LGS is 65%. The expected durations of HGS and LGS are about 16 and 3 months, respectively. Further, the paper investigates the factors that keep the THI in HGS. Empirical test results show that growth in the international tourism market and industrial production growth rate are two key factors that keep the THI in HGS, but the SARS outbreak in 2003 has had an adverse effect.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ming-Hsiang","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddd4e4d6fa6d4303d0860a8222a390279d24701c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287742/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2013.01.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517713000071; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517713000071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hamilton"],"organizations":["THI","MSM","LGS","HGS","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mean growth rate of HGS","average growth rate of LGS","high-growth","low-growth","THI","expected durations of HGS","Taiwanese tourist hotel industry cycle","industrial production growth rate","MSM","paper","probability","key factors","tourism literature","international tourism market","distinct states","determinants","model","Empirical test results","corresponding standard deviations","regimes","Markov","SARS outbreak","study","Hamilton","adverse effect","period","months"],"language":"en"},

Result The standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide) identified from the protein inhibitor complex 6W63 from protein data bank was docked with COVID 19 protein 6W63 which showed MolDock score of \u2212156.913, rerank Sore \u2212121.296 and H Bond \u22125.7369, while the flavanoid narcissoside had showed MolDock score \u2212180.739, Rerank Sore \u2212137.092 and H Bond \u221218.6771. The narcissoside showed potent inhibitory effect which is greater than standard X77. The result showed that narcissoside have high affinity towards 6W63 as it showed thirteen hydrogen bonds with nine amino acids (Arg 188, Glu 166, His 164, Cys 145 (2 bonds), Asn 14 (2 bonds), Cys 44 (2 bonds), His 41 (2 bonds), Gln 192, Thr 190) while X777 showed four hydrogen bonds with amino acids (Gly 143, Cys 145, Glu 166, Ser 144). Conclusion From computation approach it was concluded that narcissoside is a potent inhibitor of viral COVID 19 protein 6W63. The narcissoside have high affinity and inhibition potential than standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide). The narcissoside predicted as more potent inhibitor which can be further optimize, pharmacologically and clinically evaluated for the treatment of novel coronavirus COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubey, Kushagra; Dubey, Raghvendra","journal":"Biomed. j.

In the model, an infectious disease can spread in one network representing the paths of epidemic spreading (contact network), leading to the diffusion of awareness in the other network (information network), and then the diffusion of awareness will cause individuals to take social distances, which in turn affects the epidemic spreading. As for the diffusion of awareness, we assume that, on the one hand, individuals can be informed by other aware neighbors in information network, on the other hand, the susceptible individuals can be self-awareness induced by the infected neighbors in the contact networks (local information) or mass media (global information). Through Markov chain approach and numerical computations, we find that the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold can be affected by the structures of the two networks and the effective transmission rate of the awareness. However, we prove that though the introduction of the self-awareness can lower the density of infection, which cannot increase the epidemic threshold no matter of the local information or global information. Our finding is remarkably different to many previous results on single-layer network: local information based behavioral response can alter the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, our results indicate that the nodes with more neighbors (hub nodes) in information networks are easier to be informed, as a result, their risk of infection in contact networks can be effectively reduced.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kan, Jia-Qian; Zhang, Hai-Feng","journal":"Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a0c55a139eb966fb19e72b5ca560487d3ff27fd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6c008c0ac375184854e2f5e357cc983bbddefc3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128930.xml.json","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00392v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2016.08.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416302751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288421/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570416302751","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["information networks","local information","global information","epidemic threshold","diffusion of awareness","contact networks","paths of epidemic spreading","multiplex networks","single-layer network","density of infected individuals","infected neighbors","susceptible individuals","aware neighbors","self-awareness","density of infection","hand","hub nodes","previous results","risk of infection","behavioral response","mass media","matter","numerical computations","Markov chain approach","turn","effective transmission rate","social distances","infectious disease","paper","model","finding","interplay","structures","Abstract","introduction"],"language":"en"},

The host macrophages are identified as the major cellular reservoirs of CHIKV during infection and this virus triggers robust TNF production in the host macrophages, which might be a key mediator of virus induced inflammation. However, the molecular mechanism underneath TNF induction is not understood yet. Accordingly, the Raw264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line, were infected with CHIKV to address the above-mentioned question. It was observed that CHIKV induces both p38 and JNK phosphorylation in macrophages in a time-dependent manner and p-p38 inhibitor, SB203580 is effective in reducing infection even at lower concentration as compared to the p-JNK inhibitor, SP600125. However, inhibition of p-p38 and p-JNK decreased CHIKV induced TNF production in the host macrophages. Moreover, CHIKV induced macrophage derived TNF was found to facilitate TCR driven T cell activation. Additionally, it was noticed that the expressions of key transcription factors involved mainly in antiviral responses (p-IRF3) and TNF production (p-c-jun) were induced significantly in the CHIKV infected macrophages as compared to the corresponding mock cells. Further, it was demonstrated that CHIKV mediated TNF production in the macrophages is dependent on p38 and JNK MAPK pathways linking p-c-jun transcription factor. Interestingly, it was found that CHIKV nsP2 interacts with both p-p38 and p-JNK MAPKs in the macrophages. This observation was supported by the in silico protein-protein docking analysis which illustrates the specific amino acids responsible for the nsP2-MAPKs interactions. A strong polar interaction was predicted between Thr-180 (within the phosphorylation lip) of p38 and Gln-273 of nsP2, whereas, no such polar interaction was predicted for the phosphorylation lip of JNK which indicates the differential roles of p-p38 and p-JNK during CHIKV infection in the host macrophages. In summary, for the first time it has been shown that CHIKV triggers robust TNF production in the host macrophages via both p-p38 and p-JNK/p-c-jun pathways and the interaction of viral protein, nsP2 with these MAPKs during infection. Hence, this information might shed light in rationale-based drug designing strategies toward a possible control measure of CHIKV infection in future.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayak, Tapas Kumar; Mamidi, Prabhudutta; Sahoo, Subhransu Sekhar; Kumar, P.

Oropharyngeal and sputum samples were collected in order to perform microarrays-based viral testing for the detection of respiratory viruses. A total of 200 (100%) patients were analyzed and from them in 107 (53.5%) a virus was detected. The commonest identified viruses were the human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (subtypes A and B) (40.5%), influenza virus (subtypes A, B, C) (11%), rhinovirus (8%) and human Parainfluenza Virus (subtypes A and B) (7.5%). A bacterial pathogen was isolated in 27 (14%) patients and a dual infection due to a bacterial and a viral pathogen was recognised in 14/107 patients.

In Saudi Arabia recent significant hospital outbreaks, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have resulted from lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures. This study was designed to assess attitudes to, and awareness of, infection prevention and control policies and guidelines among healthcare workers of different professions and institution types in Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was administered to 607 healthcare workers including physicians (n = 133), nurses (n = 162), laboratory staff (n = 233) and other staff (n = 79) in government hospitals, private hospitals and poly clinics. Results were compared using Chi square analysis according to profession type, institution type, age group and nationality (Saudi or non-Saudi) to assess variability. Responses suggested that there are relatively high levels of uncertainty among healthcare workers across a range of infection prevention and control issues, including institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence to suggest that staff in private hospitals and nurses were more confident than other staff types. Carelessness of healthcare workers was the top-cited factor contributing to causes of outbreaks (65.07% of total group), and hospital infrastructure and design was the top-cited factor contributing to spread of infection in the hospital (54.20%), followed closely by lack and shortage of staff (53.71%) and no infection control training program (51.73%). An electronic surveillance system was considered the most effective by staff (81.22%). We have identified areas of concern among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia on infection prevention and control which vary between institutions and among different professions. This merits urgent multi-factorial actions to try to ensure outbreaks such as MERS-CoV can be minimized and contained.","publish_time":"2017-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabaan, Ali A.; Alhani, Hatem M.; Bazzi, Ali M.; Al-Ahmed, Shamsah H.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cc1db8c875f2dc95b5f6989fcbaba85d0401bfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28215912/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117300205; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2016.11.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117300205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["compliance of healthcare workers","Carelessness of healthcare workers","range of infection prevention","healthcare workers of different professions","control issues","healthcare facilities","control policies","infection control training program","staff types","Effective implementation of infection prevention","control procedures","laboratory staff","shortage of staff","non-Saudi","Saudi Arabia recent significant hospital outbreaks","institution types","private hospitals","institution-specific issues","government hospitals","awareness","hospital infrastructure","MERS-CoV","nurses","cited factor","lack","profession type","age group","total group","electronic surveillance system","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","guidelines","nationality","reporting standards","Chi square analysis","readiness","high levels of uncertainty","merits urgent multi-factorial actions","poly clinics","competence","design","institutions","areas of concern","breakdown","Results","physicians","attitudes","variability","evidence","questionnaire","study","Responses"],"language":"en"},

Recently, our group reported the isolation of the Melaka virus from a patient with acute respiratory disease and provided data suggesting that this new orthoreovirus is capable of human-to-human transmission and is probably of bat origin. Here we report yet another Melaka-like reovirus (named Kampar virus) isolated from the throat swab of a 54 year old male patient in Kampar, Perak, Malaysia who was suffering from high fever, acute respiratory disease and vomiting at the time of virus isolation. Serological studies indicated that Kampar virus was transmitted from the index case to at least one other individual and caused respiratory disease in the contact case. Sequence analysis of the four small class genome segments indicated that Kampar and Melaka viruses are closely related. This was confirmed by virus neutralization assay, showing an effective two-way cross neutralization, i.e., the serum against one virus was able to neutralize the other. Although the exact origin of Kampar virus is unknown, epidemiological tracing revealed that the house of the index case is surrounded by fruit trees frequently visited by fruit bats. There is a high probability that Kampar virus originated from bats and was transmitted to humans via bat droppings or contaminated fruits. The discovery of Kampar virus highlights the increasing trend of emergence of bat zoonotic viruses and the need to expand our understanding of bats as a source of many unknown viruses.","publish_time":"2008-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chua, Kaw Bing; Voon, Kenny; Crameri, Gary; Tan, Hui Siu; Rosli, Juliana; McEachern, Jennifer A.; Suluraju, Sivagami; Yu, Meng; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ab32c7726deaff1ef10c2ee762c2cb917d92929.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2583042.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19030226/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Serological"],"locations":["Perak","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["discovery of Kampar virus","exact origin of Kampar virus","virus neutralization assay","time of virus isolation","Melaka viruses","unknown viruses","acute respiratory disease","respiratory enteric orphan viruses","bat zoonotic viruses","bat origin","fruit bats","known disease","index case","bat droppings","understanding of bats","contact case","capable of human","human transmission","fruit trees","high fever","high probability","year old male patient","effective two-way cross neutralization","increasing trend of emergence","small class genome segments","reoviruses","humans","Perak","throat swab","Malaysia","data","need","epidemiological tracing","new orthoreovirus","contaminated fruits","house","serum","source","Sequence analysis","Serological studies","group"],"language":"en"},

Although pandemics are driven by human behaviours, current surveillance systems for identifying pandemic threats are largely reliant on the monitoring of disease outcomes in clinical settings. Standardized integrated biological\u2013behavioural surveillance could, and should, be used in community settings to complement such clinical monitoring. The usefulness of such an approach has already been demonstrated in studies on human immunodeficiency virus, where integrated surveillance contributed to a biologically based and quantifiable understanding of the behavioural risk factors associated with the transmission dynamics of the virus. When designed according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria, integrated surveillance requires that both behavioural risk factors \u2013 i.e. exposure variables \u2013 and disease-indicator outcome variables be measured in behavioural surveys. In the field of pandemic threats, biological outcome data could address the weaknesses of self-reported data collected in behavioural surveys. Data from serosurveys of viruses with pandemic potential, collected under non-outbreak conditions, indicate that serosurveillance could be used to predict future outbreaks. When conducted together, behavioural surveys and serosurveys could warn of future pandemics, potentially before the disease appears in clinical settings. Traditional disease-outcome surveillance must be frequent and ongoing to remain useful but behavioural surveillance remains informative even if conducted much less often, since behaviour change occurs slowly over time. Only through knowledge of specific behavioural risk factors can interventions and policies that can prevent the next pandemic be developed.","publish_time":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Maureen; Hagan, Emily","journal":"Bull World Health Organ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37d6ce7eabf4b6177b9462771494c7c2fc36e5ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5180348.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28053365/; https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.16.175984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Observational Studies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["behavioural surveillance","behavioural surveys","integrated surveillance","Traditional disease-outcome surveillance","knowledge of specific behavioural risk factors","clinical settings","disease-indicator outcome variables","current surveillance systems","biological outcome data","monitoring of disease outcomes","disruptive disease outbreaks","pandemic potential","clinical monitoring","field of pandemic threats","community settings","future pandemics","future outbreaks","human immunodeficiency virus","exposure variables","weaknesses of self-reported data","human behaviours","serosurveys of viruses","Reporting of Observational Studies","Epidemiology criteria","interventions","policies","non-outbreak conditions","transmission dynamics","serosurveillance","hallmark","quantifiable understanding","behaviour change","time","approach","usefulness","century"],"language":"en"},

Although dogs and other carnivores represent the greatest threat to public health as rabies reservoirs, it is commonly accepted that bats are the primary evolutionary hosts of lyssaviruses. Despite early historical documentation of rabies, molecular clock analyses indicate a quite young age of lyssaviruses, which is confusing. For example, the results obtained for partial and complete nucleoprotein gene sequences of rabies viruses (RABV), or for a limited number of glycoprotein gene sequences, indicated that the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for current bat RABV diversity in the Americas lies in the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries and might be directly or indirectly associated with the European colonization. Conversely, several other reports demonstrated high genetic similarity between lyssavirus isolates, including RABV, obtained within a time interval of 25\u201350 years. In the present study, we attempted to re-estimate the age of several North American bat RABV lineages based on the largest set of complete and partial glycoprotein gene sequences compiled to date (n = 201) employing a codon substitution model. Although our results overlap with previous estimates in marginal areas of the 95 % high probability density (HPD), they suggest a longer evolutionary history of American bat RABV lineages (TMRCA at least 732 years, with a 95 % HPD 436\u20131107 years).

Qualifying publications were summarized according to therapeutic area, medication(s) studied, pharmacokinetic model type utilized, simulator program used, and the applications of that modeling. The results showed a 13-fold increase in the number of papers published from 2012 to 2018, with the largest proportion of articles dedicated to the areas of infectious diseases, oncology, and neurology, and application extensions including prediction of drug-drug interactions due to metabolism and/or transporter-mediated effects and understanding drug kinetics in special populations. In addition, we profiled several high-impact studies whose results were used to guide package insert information and formulate dose recommendations. These results show that while utilization of PBPK modeling has drastically increased over the past several years, regulatory support, lack of easy-to-use systems for clinicians, and challenges with model validation remain major challenges for the widespread adoption of this practice in institutional and ambulatory settings.

Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.","publish_time":"2017-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desvars-Larrive, Am\u00E9lie; Pascal, Michel; Gasqui, Patrick; Cosson, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Beno\u00EEt, Etienne; Lattard, Virginie; Crespin, Laurent; Lorvelec, Olivier; Pisanu, Beno\u00EEt; Teyni\u00E9, Alexandre; Vayssier-Taussat, Muriel; Bonnet, Sarah; Marianneau, Philippe; Lac\u00F4te, Sandra; Bourhy, Pascale; Berny, Philippe; Pavio, Nicole; Le Poder, Sophie; Gilot-Fromont, Emmanuelle; Jourdain, Elsa; Hammed, Abdessalem; Fourel, Isabelle; Chikh, Farid; Vourc\u2019h, Gwena\u00EBl","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8d60caf44017989b3b9633350fc1d2efda570a5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f1a9bb377e28527cda63947734bbd74fe64207a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5590879.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brown"],"organizations":["Immunogenic"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["Chanteraines rat population","urban brown rat population","population genetics","Chanteraines urban park","urban rat populations","surrounding population","norvegicus population","widespread urban species","Chanteraines rats","high diversity of Leptospira species","high genetic diversity","Chanteraines park","immunogenic diversity","potential zoonotic pathogens","parasite species richness","rodenticide resistance","potential role","Brown rats","high prevalence","presence of anticoagulant residues","presence of rodenticide residues","anticoagulant rodenticides","Genetic results","zoonotic reservoir","model parasite occurrence","Y139F mutation","mutation Y139F","Eighty-six rats","long-term rat-control management program","multiple parasite relationships","Parasitological results","haematological data","community of parasites","Haematological parameters","connectivity","knowledge","Hauts-de-Seine","haematology","France","development","regards","eradication programs","co-infection","study","future discussions","molecular methods","gene flow","rule","Combination of microscopy","unlinked microsatellite loci","liver","maintenance","Statistical approaches","linked microsatellites","Mhc-Drb","main purpose","findings","Frequency","nuisances","sampled individuals","exception"],"language":"en"},

In the LUNG SAFE study, the largest international cohort of patients with ARDS, investigators were able to determine if ARDS was present, and at what stage the clinician made the diagnosis of ARDS. The diagnosis of ARDS was delayed or missed in two-thirds of patients, with the diagnosis missed entirely in 40% of patients, while ARDS recognition ranged from 51% in mild ARDS to 79% in severe cases. Failure to recognize ARDS in a timely fashion leads to failure to use strategies that improve survival in ARDS.

Amongst others, these include fast indexing of spatial data in distributed networks. In this paper we propose a novel semantic overlay network for large-scale multi-dimensional spatial information indexing, called SON_LSII, which has a hybrid structure integrating a semantic quad-tree and Chord ring. The SON_LSII is a small world overlay network that achieves a very competitive trade-off between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead. To create SON_LSII, we use an effective semantic clustering strategy that considers two aspects, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances. Based on SON_LSII, a mapping method is used to reduce the multi-dimensional features into a single dimension and an efficient indexing algorithm is presented to support complex range queries of the spatial information with a massive number of concurrent users. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate that SON_LSII is superior to existing overlay networks in various respects, including scalability, maintenance, rate of indexing hits, indexing logical hops, and adaptability. Thus, the proposed SON_LSII can be used for large-scale spatial information indexing.","publish_time":"2013-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Zhiqiang; Wang, Yue; Cao, Kai; Qu, Tianshan; Wang, Zhongmin","journal":"Computers \u0026 Geosciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb75b255e56960c472d2d13c3b23d5b392e95253.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125740.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287505/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0098300413001192; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.04.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300413001192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Computer Science and Geographic Information Science"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LSII","semantic of spatial information","large-scale spatial information indexing","large-scale multi-dimensional spatial information indexing","indexing efficiency","fast indexing of spatial data","online services of spatial information","proposed SON","novel semantic overlay network","Geographic Information Science","efficient indexing algorithm","rate of indexing hits","small world overlay network","existing overlay networks","semantic quad-tree","physical network performances","effective semantic clustering strategy","multi-dimensional features","distributed networks","maintenance overhead","Computer Science","single dimension","various respects","scalability","new challenges","competitive trade-off","peer","complex range queries","logical hops","increased demand","hybrid structure","massive number of concurrent users","Chord ring","aspects","extensive experiments","mapping method","results","paper","adaptability"],"language":"en"},

Apart from standard hygiene measures, cohorting of RSV-infected patients separately from RSV-negative patients is frequently applied to prevent cross-infection, although evidence to support this practice is lacking. The objective is to evaluate the risk of room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in children \u003C 2 years hospitalised with acute bronchiolitis. During the first day of admission, patients shared one room, pending results of virological diagnosis (PCR). When diagnostic results were available, RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients were separated. Standard hygienic measures (gowns, gloves, masks, hand washing) were used in all patients. RESULTS: We included 48 patients (83% RSV-positive). Co-infection was found in nine patients at admission, and two during hospitalisation (23%). The two patients with acquired co-infection had been nursed in a single room during the entire admission. None of 37 patients sharing a room with other bronchiolitis patients (20 with patients with a different virus) were co-infected during admission. Disease severity in co-infection was not worse than in mono-infection. CONCLUSION: One in five patients with bronchiolitis was co-infected, but co-infection acquired during admission was rare and was not associated with more severe disease. Room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients (on the first day of admission) did not influence the risk of co-infection, suggesting that cohorting of RSV-infected patients separate from non-RSV-infected patients may not be indicated.","publish_time":"2013-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bekhof, Jolita; Bakker, Joline; Reimink, Roelien; Wessels, Mirjam; Langenhorst, Veerle; Brand, Paul L.P.; Ruijs, Gijs J.H.M.","journal":"J Clin Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/447da2087b2d876e228b40eb8a29446bfd585499.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3808260.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4021/jocmr1556w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24171054/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV-negative patients","bronchiolitis patients","non-RSV-infected patients","RSV-positive","cohorting of RSV","risk of co-infection","mono-infection","cross-infection","day of admission","risk of room","entire admission","single room","acute bronchiolitis","different virus","hospitalisation","diagnostic results","respiratory syncytial virus","Standard hygienic measures","standard hygiene measures","main causative virus","results of virological diagnosis","young children","Disease severity","severe disease","gloves","winter season","gowns","major cause","prospective observational cohort study","masks","years","hand washing","PCR","BACKGROUND","evidence","METHODS","practice","objective","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N =44] and SARS ICU [N =26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N =15] and CCU [N =17]). Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p \u003C0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p \u003C0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.","publish_time":"2007-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Tung-Ping; Lien, Te-Cheng; Yang, Chih-Yi; Su, Yiet Ling; Wang, Jia-Horng; Tsai, Sing-Ling; Yin, Jeo-Chen","journal":"Journal of Psychiatric Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0987d9c6c5278a01841398509512aafa1ca8e14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094424.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395605001561; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395605001561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CCU [N","CCU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS regular","SARS outbreak","regular SARS unit","non-SARS unit nurses","non-SARS units","SARS patient care","structured SARS ICU environment","nurses care","adjustment of nurses","psychological status of nurses","unit subjects","psychological impact","acute stress","gradual psychological adaptation","prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms","perceived negative feelings","Neurology","family support","Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms","insomnia rate","depression","structured work environment","mood ratings","higher rate","acute phase","Nurse participants","Positive coping attitude","previous mood disorder history","periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity","younger age","sleep disturbance","significant reduction","direct exposure","caring staffs","anxiety","future bio-disaster","increasing knowledge","lowered risk factors","ill patients","end","study","groups","conclusion","difference","Results"],"language":"en"},

It is one of six known genotypes in the yellow head complex of nidoviruses which also includes mildly pathogenic gill-associated virus (GAV, genotype 2) and four other genotypes (genotypes 3\u20136) that have been detected only in healthy shrimp. In this study, comparative phylogenetic analyses conducted on replicase- (ORF1b) and glycoprotein- (ORF3) gene amplicons identified 10 putative natural recombinants amongst 28 viruses representing all six genotypes from across the Indo-Pacific region. The \u223C4.6 kb genomic region spanning the two amplicons was sequenced for three putative recombinant viruses from Vietnam (genotype 3/5), the Philippines (genotype 5/2) and Indonesia (genotype 3/2). SimPlot analysis using these and representative parental virus sequences confirmed that each was a recombinant genotype and identified a recombination hotspot in a region just upstream of the ORF1b C-terminus. Maximum-likelihood breakpoint analysis predicted identical crossover positions in the Vietnamese and Indonesian recombinants, and a crossover position 12 nt upstream in the Philippine recombinant. Homologous genetic recombination in the same genome region was also demonstrated in recombinants generated experimentally in shrimp co-infected with YHV and GAV. The high frequency with which natural recombinants were identified indicates that genetic exchange amongst genotypes is occurring commonly in Asia and playing a significant role in expanding the genetic diversity in the yellow head complex. This is the first evidence of genetic recombination in viruses infecting crustaceans and has significant implications for the pathogenesis of infection and diagnosis of these newly emerging invertebrate pathogens.","publish_time":"2009-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wijegoonawardane, Priyanjalie K.M.; Sittidilokratna, Nusra; Petchampai, Natthida; Cowley, Jeff A.; Gudkovs, Nicholas; Walker, Peter J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acf96ddbc6d42b5cb7d62498d9c3d79125bb2901.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127526.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209002621; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19487006/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209002621","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Philippine","YHV"],"locations":["Vietnam","Indonesia","Asia"],"keyphrases":["recombinant genotype","known genotypes","putative natural recombinants","putative recombinant viruses","Homologous genetic recombination","evidence of genetic recombination","Indonesian recombinants","genetic diversity","Abstract Yellow head virus","genetic exchange","genome region","genomic region","yellow head complex of nidoviruses","YHV","GAV","recombination hotspot","Philippine recombinant","Indo-Pacific region","healthy shrimp","shrimp co-infected","gene amplicons","significant implications","pathogenic gill-associated virus","representative parental virus sequences","SimPlot analysis","significant role","virulent pathogen of Penaeus monodon shrimp","identical crossover positions","ORF1b C-terminus","Maximum-likelihood breakpoint analysis","diagnosis","replicase","glycoprotein","Vietnamese","ORF3","crustaceans","pathogenesis of infection","comparative phylogenetic analyses","emerging invertebrate pathogens","study","high frequency","Asia","Philippines"],"language":"en"},

Some hospital departments are at higher risk of infection. Objective: To describe TB cases detected after TB screening in HCW from a hospital department (Ear, Nose and Throat \u2013 ENT) who had had contact with active TB cases. Material and methods: All HCW (73) from Hospital S\u00E3o Jo\u00E3o\u2019s ENT Unit who had been in contact with two in-patients with active TB underwent TB screening. Those who had symptoms underwent chest X-ray and mycobacteriological sputum exam. Results: Of 73 HCW who underwent TB screening, TB diagnosis was established in 9 (8 female; median age: 30 years; 1 doctor, 6 nurses, 2 nursing auxiliaries). Pulmonary TB was found in 8 and extra-pulmonary TB in 1. Microbiology diagnosis was obtained in 7 cases by sputum smear, n=2; culture exam in bronchial lavage, n=4 and histological exam of pleural tissue, n=1. In 4 cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA was extracted from cultures and molecular typing was done. All cases had identical MIRU types, which allowed identification of the epidemiological link. Conclusion: Nosocomial TB is prominent and efforts should be made to implement successful infection control measures in health care facilities and an effective TB screening program in HCW. Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis facilitates cluster identification.

Uptake of pathogens by dendritic cells may lead to cross-presentation of antigens or infection of these cells, which ultimately results in activation of virus-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes. Little is known about the interaction of DC-SIGN with influenza A viruses. Here we show that a virus with a non-functional receptor binding site in its hemagglutinin, can replicate in cells expressing DC-SIGN. Also in the absence of sialic acids, which is the receptor for influenza A viruses, these viruses replicate in DC-SIGN expressing cells including human dendritic cells.

Abstract Objective To study differences in the presentation of laboratory-confirmed acute viral respiratory infections, especially gastroenteritis symptoms, according to age and causative viral agent during five influenza seasons (1999 to 2004.) Material and methods Five influenza seasons (1999-2000 to 2003-2004) were studied. Data from samples taken at 24 primary care sentinel centres for influenza surveillance distributed throughout Catalonia (Spain), which were positive for any of the viruses studied (influenza virus A, [IVA], influenza virus B [IVB], syncytial respiratory virus [SRV], adenovirus [ADV] and parainfluenza 1,2,3 viruses), were analyzed. The following clinical variables were evaluated: sudden onset, fever, respiratory symptoms, sore throat, malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms. These variables were studied for each virus and for two age groups: age 14 years or younger and older than 14 years. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results Of a total of 1,591 samples tested during the influenza seasons studied, 42.68% (679) samples belonged to subjects aged \u2264 14 years and 57.32% (912) to subjects aged\u003E14 years. There were 286 IVA (166/286 [58.04%] in subjects aged \u2264 14 years and 120/286 [41.95%] in subjects aged\u003E14 years), 107 were positive for IVB (78/107 [72.90%] in subjects aged \u2264 14 years and 29/107 [27.10%] in subjects aged\u003E14 years), 53 SRV (39/53 [73.58%] in subjects aged \u2264 14 years and 12/53 [22.64%] in subjects aged\u003E14 years) and 40 ADV (36/40 [90%] in subjects aged \u2264 14 years and 4/40 [10%] in subjects aged\u003E14 years). The differences in symptoms between the two age groups could be compared for IVA: fever (OR=16.536; 95% CI=4.893-55.887; p=0.001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (OR=4.664; 95% CI=1.569-13.868; p\u003C0.03) were significantly more frequent in subjects aged \u2264 14 years, while malaise (OR=0.048; 95% CI=0.026-0.089; p=0.001) was more frequent in subjects aged\u003E14 years. Conclusions The results indicate that acute viral respiratory infections always present with fever in children, whatever the virus, but not in adults. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more strongly associated with IVA and IVB and these symptoms were most frequent in children aged under 5 years.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torner, N.; Mart\u00EDnez, A.; Ruiz, L.; Pumarola, T.; Marcos, M.

It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis \u0026 Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially followed during the early days of the MERS-CoV epidemic, which were characterized by overwhelming uncertainty. The SCH\u2019s commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy since day one, contributed to creating the SCH\u2019s image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of the overall response efforts. Yet, conflicting messages and over reassurance were among the observed pitfalls of the implemented ERC strategy. Conclusion: The adoption of CERC principles can help restore and maintain the credibility of responding agencies.

ARDS patients suffer from severe hypoxemia, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy may be necessary to ensure oxygenation. ARDS has various etiologies, including trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury or infections of various origins, and the associated immunological responses may vary. To support the immunological response in this patient collective, we used intravenous IgM immunoglobulin therapy to enhance the likelihood of pulmonary recovery. METHODS: ARDS patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who were placed on ECMO and treated with (IVIG group; n = 29) or without (control group; n = 28) intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins for 3 days in the initial stages of ARDS were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups, although the IVIG group showed a significantly reduced oxygenation index compared to the control group. We found no differences in the length of ICU stay or ventilation parameters. We did not find a significant difference between the groups for the extent of inflammation or for overall survival. CONCLUSION: We conclude that administration of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins as an additional therapy did not have a beneficial effect in patients with severe ARDS requiring ECMO support.

Effective surveillance for acute respiratory infectious diseases in a recruit training site is an important way to prevent disease outbreaks. METHODS: Eight hundred recruits (722 males and 78 females) enlisted in autumn 2015 received a background survey within 24 h of settlement at the recruit training site, including their general personal information, vaccination history, mental status and clinical symptoms. Then, nasopharyngeal swabs of these recruits were collected to detect common respiratory pathogens [influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, adenovirus (Adv), human respiratory syncytial virus, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus] by PCR. In addition, fasting venous blood was collected in the morning for adenovirus IgG antibody detection. During the three months of training, the recruits were monitored for symptoms of respiratory infection, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from those with an axillary temperature \u226538 \u00B0C and other respiratory symptoms within 4 h of symptom onset. Samples were further examined by PCR. RESULTS: Among the 795 effective nasopharyngeal swab samples collected during survey, two cases of group C type 1 adenovirus were identified by PCR. During the 3 months of training, fever and respiratory symptoms occurred in 39 recruits (incidence rate of 4.9%) and 5 cases of adenovirus were detected (positive rate of 12.8%). Genotyping showed 3 cases of type 4 adenovirus and 2 of type 3 adenovirus. No type 7, 14 or 55 adenovirus was detected. The Adv-IgG positive rate of recruits was 48.2%. Among the 5 Adv positive cases with fever and respiratory symptoms, 4 were Adv-IgG positive. CONCLUSION: The pathogen carrier rate in recruits was low, and only group C adenovirus, which causes mild infection in humans, was detected. No respiratory outbreak was observed at the recruit training site, and sporadic cases were mainly caused by type 3 and type 4 adenoviruses.","publish_time":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei-Wei; Xu, Wen; Xie, Yang-Xin; Zhang, Yun-Hui; Wu, Dan; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhao, Min","journal":"Mil Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c21ac102e96cf6a038edb3fd4fb7d7dd4471170.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5376280.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373908/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-017-0120-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","cases of type","cases of adenovirus","symptoms of respiratory infection","respiratory outbreak","cases of group C type","group C adenovirus","Adv positive cases","Adv-IgG positive rate of recruits","human respiratory syncytial virus","months of training","Recruit training sites","common respiratory pathogens","influenza virus type B","acute respiratory infectious diseases","high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases","adenovirus IgG antibody detection","clinical symptoms","sporadic cases","incidence rate","PCR","nasopharyngeal swabs","human bocavirus","human metapneumovirus","background survey","fever","effective nasopharyngeal swab samples","pathogen carrier rate","Effective surveillance","h of settlement","mild infection","h of symptom onset","vaccination history","general personal information","places","mental status","morning","important way","venous blood","disease outbreaks","autumn","CONCLUSION","females","addition","humans","axillary temperature","RESULTS","Genotyping","adenoviruses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The virus is a novel coronavirus isolated from patients exhibiting atypical pneumonia and may have originated from wild animals such as civet cats in southern China. The genome of SARS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA whose sequence is distantly related to all known coronaviruses that infect humans and animals. Like other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing three outer structural proteins, namely the membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein together with the viral RNA genome presumably form a helical core located within the viral envelope. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is a 423 amino-acid, predicted phospho-protein of 46kDa that shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. A short serine-rich stretch, and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal are unique to it, thus suggesting its involvement in many important functions during the viral life cycle. In this report we have cloned the N gene of the SARS coronavirus, and studied its property of self-association to form dimers. We expressed the N protein as a fusion protein in the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate self-association and confirmed dimerization of the N protein from mammalian cell lysates by coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, via deletion analysis, we have shown that the C-terminal 209 amino-acid region constitutes the interaction domain responsible for self-association of the N protein to form dimers.","publish_time":"2004-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surjit, Milan; Liu, Boping; Kumar, Purnima; Chow, Vincent T.K; Lal, Sunil K","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8321bf6ff40cb7c32c781dd52b6f814cf644c2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111157.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04006588; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04006588","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["southern China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","fusion protein","genome of SARS","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","N gene","predicted phospho-protein","novel coronavirus","coronavirus family","viral envelope","property of self-association","viral RNA genome","known coronaviruses","dimers","amino-acid region","viral life cycle","enveloped virus","severe outbreak","wild animals","single-stranded RNA","outer structural proteins","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","interaction domain responsible","putative bipartite nuclear localization signal","confirmed dimerization","helical core","mammalian cell lysates","civet cats","important functions","kDa","positive-sense","hybrid system","short serine-rich stretch","members","atypical pneumonia","patients","spike","membrane","sequence","little homology","yeast","coimmunoprecipitation","southern China","C-terminal","regions","humans","world","involvement","report","deletion analysis"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent (2015) MERS-CoV outbreak at a large tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We conducted an epidemiologic outbreak investigation, including case finding and contact tracing and screening. MERS-CoV cases were categorized as suspected, probable, and confirmed. A confirmed case was defined as positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Of the 130 suspected cases, 81 (62%) were confirmed and 49 (38%) were probable. These included 87 patients (67%) and 43 healthcare workers (33%). Older age (mean [SD], 64.4 [18.3] vs 40.1 [11.3] years, P\u003C.001), symptoms (97% vs 58%, P\u003C.001), and comorbidity (99% vs 42%, P\u003C.001) were more common in patients than healthcare workers. Almost all patients (97%) were hospitalized whereas most healthcare workers (72%) were home isolated. Among 96 hospitalized cases, 63 (66%) required intensive care unit management and 60 (63%) required mechanical ventilation. Among all 130 cases, 51 (39%) died; all were patients (51 [59%]) with no deaths among healthcare workers. More than half (54%) of infections were believed to be caught at the emergency department. Strict infection control measures, including isolation and closure of the emergency department, were implemented to interrupt the chain of transmission and end the outbreak. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV remains a major healthcare threat. Early recognition of cases and rapid implementation of infection control measures are necessary.

In 2014, there were further outbreaks of the disease occurring within four months of each other. In this study, the full-length genome sequences of two genetically distinct PEDV isolates from the outbreaks were characterized. The two PEDV isolates, CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014, were 28,039 and 28,033 nucleotides in length and showed 96.2% and 93.6% similarities at nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively. In total, we have observed 1048 nucleotide substitutions throughout the genome. Compared to EAS1/2014, CBR1/2014 has 2 insertions of 4 ((56)GENQ(59)) and 1 ((140)N) amino acid positions 56\u201359 and 140, and 2 deletions of 2 ((160)DG(161)) and 1 ((1199)Y) amino acid positions 160\u2013161 and 1199. The phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genome of CBR1/2014 isolate has grouped the virus with the pandemic variants. In contrast, EAS1/2014 isolate was grouped with CV777, LZC and SM98, a classical variant. Our findings demonstrated the emergence of EAS1/2014, a classical variant which is novel to Thailand and genetically distinct from the currently circulating endemic variants.

The UV\u2010C method was performed at different UV light doses (from 750 to 9000 J l(\u22121)) using a pilot plant UV\u2010C device working under turbulent flow. Spray\u2010drying treatment was done at inlet temperature 220 \u00B1 1\u00B0C and two different outlet temperatures, 80 \u00B1 1\u00B0C or 70 \u00B1 1\u00B0C. Results indicated that UV\u2010C treatment induced a 4 log(10) viability reduction for both E. coli at 3000 J l(\u22121). Full inactivation of both E. coli strains was achieved in all spray\u2010dried samples dehydrated at both outlet temperatures. The special UV\u2010C system design for turbid liquid porcine plasma is a novel treatment that can provide an additional redundant biosafety feature that can be incorporated into the manufacturing process for spray\u2010dried animal plasma. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The safety of raw materials from animal origin such as spray\u2010dried porcine plasma (SDPP) may be a concern for the swine industry. Ultraviolet treatment at 254 nm (UV\u2010C) of liquid plasma has been proposed as an additional biosafety feature in the manufacturing process of SDPP. We found that UV\u2010C exposure in the liquid plasma at 3000 J l(\u22121) reduces about 4 log10 ml(\u22121) for E. coli K88 and K99. Full inactivation of both E. coli strains was achieved in all spray\u2010dried samples. The incorporation of UV\u2010C treatment to liquid plasma improves the robustness of the SDPP manufacturing process.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bl\u00E1zquez, E.; Rodr\u00EDguez, C.; R\u00F3denas, J.; P\u00E9rez de Rozas, A.; Campbell, J.M.; Segal\u00E9s, J.; Pujols, J.; Polo, J.","journal":"Lett Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30e08db2437779d4587e2d51114db369ddec60eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165488.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30152866/; https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["Escherichia","SDPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C treatment","C method","spray","C device","C exposure","liquid plasma","special UV","incorporation of UV","C system design","dried porcine plasma","dried animal plasma","drying treatment","pilot plant UV","turbid liquid porcine plasma","Ultraviolet treatment","different UV light doses","drying method","coli strains","novel treatment","manufacturing process of SDPP","SDPP manufacturing process","dried samples","inactivation of Escherichia coli K88","nm","additional biosafety feature","K99","study","different outlet temperatures","additional redundant biosafety feature","irradiation system","animal origin","independent safety steps","safety of raw materials","robustness","inlet temperature","turbulent flow","concern","IMPACT","viability reduction","effectiveness","Results","swine industry","SIGNIFICANCE","objectives","log10"],"language":"en"},

In both cases, China demonstrated strong incentives to participate in the negotiation of legally binding international rules. Still, the sovereignty issue was a major, if not the biggest, concern for China when engaging in global health rule making. The two cases also reveal domestic political economy as an important factor in shaping China\u0027s position in international health negotiations.","publish_time":"2014-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Y.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fcd00c95eba171b36bd5fe211ee06c182e621eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118741.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350613002643; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370173/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350613002643","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["international health negotiations","China\u0027s position","China\u0027s attitudes","revised International Health Regulations","domestic political economy","cases","binding international rules","global health rule","sovereignty issue","Tobacco Control","important factor","Framework Convention","concerns","actions","responsible power","sets of factors","aspiration","strong incentives","paper"],"language":"en"},

Limited data exist on the epidemiology of ICU-acquired infections in China. This retrospective study was carried out to determine the current status of nosocomial infection in China. METHODS: A retrospective review of nococomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in East China between 2003 and 2007 was performed. Nosocomial infections were defined according to the definitions of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The overall patient nosocomial infection rate, the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections, the excess length of stay, and distribution of nosocomial infection sites were determined. Then, pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were further investigated. RESULTS: Among 1980 patients admitted over the period of time, the overall patient nosocomial infection rate was 26.8% or 51.0 per 1000 patient days., Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) accounted for most of the infections (68.4%), followed by urinary tract infections (UTI, 15.9%), bloodstream (BSI, 5.9%), and gastrointestinal tract (GI, 2.5%) infections. There was no significant change in LRTI, UTI and BSI infection rates during the 5 years. However, GI rate was significantly decreased from 5.5% in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007. In addition, A. baumannii, C. albicans and S. epidermidis were the most frequent pathogens isolated in patients with LRTIs, UTIs and BSIs, respectively. The rates of isolates resistant to commonly used antibiotics ranged from 24.0% to 93.1%. CONCLUSION: There was a high and relatively stable rate of nosocomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in China through year 2003\u20132007, with some differences in the distribution of the infection sites, and pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility profiles from those reported from the Western countries. Guidelines for surveillance and prevention of nosocomial infections must be implemented in order to reduce the rate.","publish_time":"2009-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Ji-Guang; Sun, Qing-Feng; Li, Ke-Cheng; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Miao, Xiao-Hui; Ni, Wu; Hong, Liang; Yang, Jin-Xian; Ruan, Zhan-Wei; Zhou, Rui-Wei; Zhou, Hai-Jiao; He, Wen-Fei","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ebef419c2970287a5fd24ea38695453e0bbfffa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2722662.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19630992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","BSI"],"locations":["China","East China"],"keyphrases":["prevention of nosocomial infections","stable rate of nosocomial infections","incidence density rate of nosocomial infections","overall patient nosocomial infection rate","urinary tract infections","distribution of nosocomial infection sites","current status of nosocomial infection","Lower respiratory tract infections","GI rate","retrospective review of nococomial infections","BSI infection rates","patients","epidemiology of ICU","East China","patient days","tertiary hospital","gastrointestinal tract","antibiotic susceptibility profiles","antimicrobial susceptibility profiles","retrospective study","rates of isolates resistant","major threat","excess length of stay","LRTIs","intensive care unit","period of time","epidermidis","Disease Control","frequent pathogens","definitions of Centers","surveillance","used antibiotics","significant change","baumannii","albicans","METHODS","UTIs","BSIs","Guidelines","years","BACKGROUND","order","Limited data","addition","bloodstream","differences","Western countries","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

With a longitudinal study we relate changes in national IHR core capacities to changes in cross\u2010border infectious disease threat events (IDTE) between 2010 and 2016, collected through epidemic intelligence at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). By combining all IHR core capacities into one composite measure we found that a 10% increase in the mean of this composite IHR core capacity to be associated with a 19% decrease (p = 0.017) in the incidence of cross\u2010border IDTE in the EU. With respect to specific IHR core capacities, an individual increase in national legislation, policy \u0026 financing; coordination and communication with relevant sectors; surveillance; response; preparedness; risk communication; human resource capacity; or laboratory capacity was associated with a significant decrease in cross\u2010border IDTE incidence. In contrast, our analysis showed that IHR core capacities relating to point\u2010of\u2010entry, zoonotic events or food safety were not associated with IDTE in the EU. Due to high internal correlations between core capacities, we conducted a principal component analysis which confirmed a 20% decrease in risk of IDTE for every 10% increase in the core capacity score (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88). Globally (EU excluded), a 10% increase in the mean of all IHR core capacities combined was associated with a 14% decrease (p = 0.077) in cross\u2010border IDTE incidence. We provide quantitative evidence that improvements in IHR core capacities at country\u2010level are associated with fewer cross\u2010border IDTE in the EU, which may also hold true for other parts of the world.","publish_time":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Semenza, Jan C.; Sewe, Maquines Odhiambo; Lindgren, Elisabet; Brusin, Sergio; Aaslav, Kaja Kaasik; Mollet, Thomas; Rockl\u00F6v, Joacim","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abd53dcf1f9552913a4e99b759c0df469577d5b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6852001.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022321/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13211","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHR","EU","IDTE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["national IHR core capacities","specific IHR core capacities","composite IHR core capacity","IHR core capacity implementation","core capacity score","national public health core capacities","border IDTE incidence","risk of IDTE","incidence of cross","laboratory capacity","fewer cross","individual increase","significant decrease","human resource capacity","border infectious disease threat events","national legislation","risk communication","Recurrent health emergencies","global health security","mean","International Health Regulations","changes","Disease Prevention","zoonotic events","principal component analysis","preparedness","policy","European Centre","relevant sectors","coordination","surveillance","response","financing","improvements","country","level","Control","entry","food safety","point","quantitative evidence","high internal correlations","respect","epidemic intelligence","longitudinal study","ECDC","threats","world","parts","contrast"],"language":"en"},

These individuals and organisations previously set health priorities for WHO, either through its regular budget or extra-budgetary funds. We asked what insights can be gained as to their priorities from previous decisions within the context of WHO. METHODS: We compared the WHO biennial budgetary allocations with the burden of disease from 1994\u201395 to 2008\u201309. We obtained data from publicly available WHO sources and examined whether WHO allocations varied with the burden of disease (defined by death and disability-adjusted life years) by comparing two WHO regions\u2014Western Pacific and Africa\u2014that are at differing stages of epidemiological transition. We further assessed whether the allocations differed on the basis of the source of funds (assessed and voluntary contributions) and the mechanism for deciding how funds were spent. FINDINGS: We noted that WHO budget allocations were heavily skewed toward infectious diseases. In 2006\u201307, WHO allocated 87% of its total budget to infectious diseases, 12% to non-communicable diseases, and less than 1% to injuries and violence. We recorded a similar distribution of funding in Africa, where nearly three-quarters of mortality is from infectious disease, and in Western Pacific, where three-quarters of mortality is from non-communicable disease. In both regions, injuries received only 1% of total resources. The skew towards infectious diseases was substantially greater for the WHO extra-budget, which is allocated by donors and has risen greatly in recent years, than for the WHO regular budget, which is decided on by member states through democratic mechanisms and has been held at zero nominal growth. INTERPRETATION: Decision makers at Bamako should consider the implications of the present misalignment of global health priorities and disease burden for health research worldwide. Funds allocated by external donors substantially differ from those allocated by WHO member states. The meeting at Bamako provides an opportunity to consider how this disparity might be addressed.

Prevention of diarrhea in puppies requires a global approach encompassing enteropathogens, environment and management practices especially when housed in groups. The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence of enteropathogens in puppies in breeding kennels and to identify risk factors of diarrhea. Two hundred and sixty six puppies (between 5 and 14weeks of age) from 29 French breeding kennels were included. For each kennel, data about environment, management of the kennel and puppies\u2019 characteristics (age, sex and breed) were collected. For each puppy, fecal consistency and fecal excretion of enteropathogens (viruses and parasites) was evaluated. At least one enteropathogen was identified in 77.1% of puppies and 24.8% of puppies presented abnormal feces. The main risk factor of weaning diarrhea was fecal excretion of canine parvovirus type 2 (odds ratio=5; confidence interval 95%: 1.7\u201314.7). A targeted sanitary and medical prophylaxis against canine parvovirus type 2 should be implemented to decrease risk of weaning diarrhea.","publish_time":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grellet, Aur\u00E9lien; Chastant-Maillard, Sylvie; Robin, Coralie; Feugier, Alexandre; Boogaerts, Cassandre; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Grandjean, Dominique; Polack, Bruno","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/506cb2a3df8ea8f08442e700050c019f678e5f96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114196.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587714002517; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.07.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175676/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587714002517","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of weaning diarrhea","risk factors of diarrhea","Prevention of diarrhea","Abstract Diarrhea","main risk factor of weaning diarrhea","fecal excretion of canine parvovirus type","fecal consistency","environment","increased risk of death","French breeding kennels","management practices","weeks of age","abnormal feces","degradation of feces quality","odds ratio","medical prophylaxis","reduced daily weight gain","global approach encompassing","puppies\u2019 characteristics","sex","puppy","confidence interval","viruses","data","prevalence","frequent disorders","study","dogs","groups","parasites","purpose","enteropathogen"],"language":"en"},

China also had a sudden increase in the incidence of the disease in 2011. In this study, we aimed to assess the epidemiological changes before and after the upsurge. We also aimed to explore the reasons for the upsurge in disease in 2011, the epidemiological factors that contributed to it, and assess how these could be managed to prevent future epidemics. METHODS: In this observational study, we extracted the epidemiological data for all cases of scarlet fever between 2004 and 2016 in China from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center, the official website of National Health Commission of the People\u0027s Republic of China, and the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. These data had been collected from 31 provinces and regions in China and included geographical, seasonal, and patient demographic information. We used descriptive statistical methods and joinpoint regression to examine the spatiotemporal patterns and annual percentage change in incidence of the upsurge of disease across China. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2016, 502 723 cases of scarlet fever, with ten fatalities, were reported in China, resulting in an annualised average incidence of 2\u00B78807 per 100 000 people. The annual average incidence increased from 1\u00B7457 per 100 000 people in 2004 to 4\u00B77638 per 100 000 people in 2011 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3\u00B727, 95% CI 3\u00B722\u20133\u00B732; p\u003C0\u00B70001), peaking in 2015 (5\u00B70092 per 100 000 people). The annual incidence after the 2011 upsurge of scarlet fever, between 2011 and 2016, was twice the average annual incidence reported between 2004 and 2010 (4\u00B70125 vs 1\u00B79105 per 100 000 people; IRR 2\u00B707, 95% CI 2\u00B706\u20132\u00B709; p\u003C0\u00B70001). Most cases were distributed in the north, northeast, and northwest of the country. Semi-annual patterns were observed in May\u2013June and November\u2013December. The median age at onset of disease was 6 years, with the annual highest incidence observed in children aged 6 years (49\u00B74675 per 100 000 people). The incidence among boys and men was 1\u00B754 greater than that among girls and women before the upsurge, and 1\u00B751 times greater after the upsurge (p\u003C0\u00B70001 for both). The median time from disease onset to reporting of the disease was shorter after the upsurge in disease than before (3 days vs 4 days; p=0\u00B7001). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the largest epidemiological study of scarlet fever worldwide. The patterns of infection across the country were similar before and after the 2011 upsurge, but the incidence of disease was substantially higher after 2011. Prevention and control strategies being implemented in response to this threat include improving disease surveillance and emergency response systems.

Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5\u2032 fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3\u2032 fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5\u2032 tree could be rejected for the 3\u2032 region, and the optimal 3\u2032 tree could be rejected for the 5\u2032 region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1\u20133 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3\u2032 RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rest, Joshua S; Mindell, David P","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2029617f5839a09db987a746e2d03561fd9ea801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129878.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134803000935; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134803000935","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RDRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV RDRP","SARS-CoV lineage","SARS-CoV proteins","RDRP fragment of SARS","multiple host-species","known host-species","Inference of host","avian coronaviruses","species associations","additional host-species shift","history of host","analyses of N","Conservation of RDRP","Comparison of phylogenetic trees","recombination breakpoint","phylogenetic relationships","statistical evidence","Demonstration of recombination","mammals","humans","alternative trees","supported trees","sister relationship","region","Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","statistical incongruence","coronavirus groups","strong evidence","different topologies","current sampling","sliding window analyses","potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome","important challenge","public health management","turkey","rapid unpredictable change","drug","chicken","manx shearwater","nucleocapsid","mouse","sudden appearance","little signal","focused attention","set of Arteriviridae taxa","vaccine development","Coronaviridae phylogeny","spike","clade","origins"],"language":"en"},

Different types of EAE have been developed in order to investigate pathogenetic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of the heterogenic human disease. Generally, investigations in EAE are more suitable for the analysis of immunogenetic elements (major histocompatibility complex restriction and candidate risk genes) and for the study of histopathological features (inflammation, demyelination and degeneration) of the disease than for screening of new treatments. Recent studies in new EAE models, especially in transgenic ones, have in connection with new analytical techniques such as microarray assays provided a deeper insight into the pathogenic cellular and molecular mechanisms of EAE and potentially of MS. For example, it was possible to better delineate the role of soluble pro-inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, interferon-\u03B3 and interleukins 1, 12 and 23), anti-inflammatory (transforming growth factor-\u03B2 and interleukins 4, 10, 27 and 35) and neurotrophic factors (ciliary neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor).

The disease that develops in this model is similar to chronic obstructive lung disease in humans. Using this model we have characterized two distinct phases in the chronic disease process. The first phase appears at three weeks after viral infection and depends on type I interferon-dependent expression and then subsequent activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03B5RI) on conventional lung dendritic cells, which in turn recruit IL-13-producing CD4(\u002B) T cells to the lower airways. The second phase becomes maximal at seven weeks after infection and depends on invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and lung macrophages. Cellular cross-talk relies on interactions between the semi-invariant V\u03B114J\u03B118 T-cell receptor on lung iNKT cells and CD1d on macrophages as well as iNKT cell-derived IL-13 and IL-13 receptor on macrophages. These interactions drive macrophages to a pattern of alternative activation and overproduction of IL-13. This innate immune axis is also activated in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, as evidenced by increased numbers of iNKT cells and IL-13-producing alternatively activated macrophages marked by chitinase 1 production. Together the findings identify two new immune pathways responsible for early and late phases of chronic inflammatory lung disease in experimental and clinical settings. These findings extend our understanding of the complex mechanisms that underlie chronic obstructive lung disease and provide useful targets for diagnosis and therapy of this common disorder.","publish_time":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benoit, Loralyn A.; Holtzman, Michael J.","journal":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36a90735892ad7f68721a6d417d821c726eae0cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b9cfa51a20b411553782bea2df83efb708eb5baa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3060024.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20146716/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3060024?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05136.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung macrophages","chronic obstructive lung disease","lung iNKT cells","immunopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung disease","chronic disease process","late phases of chronic inflammatory lung disease","mouse model of disease","conventional lung dendritic cells","activated macrophages","iNKT cell-derived IL","overproduction of IL","increased numbers of iNKT cells","turn recruit IL","semi-invariant V\u03B114J\u03B118 T-cell receptor","interactions","respiratory viral infection","weeks","findings","invariant natural killer T","distinct phases","high-affinity IgE receptor","subsequent activation","pattern of alternative activation","innate immune axis","new immune pathways responsible","Fc\u03B5RI","useful targets","diagnosis","complex mechanisms","patients","CD1d","therapy","interferon-dependent expression","type","clinical settings","CD4","humans","Cellular cross-talk","common disorder","understanding","chitinase","lower airways"],"language":"en"},

Since outbreak management is essential to disease control, we aimed to examine university students\u0027 knowledge of and attitudes toward the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and vaccination and other preventive measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 first year university students at Yeditepe University in Istanbul, Turkey between 1(st )and 30(th )of November 2009. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics of the students, perceptions, level of knowledge and attitudes toward influenza pandemic and prevention measures were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed by the students affiliated with SANITAS, a university club of students in health related sciences. RESULTS: 25.1% (101/402) of the study group perceived their personal risk of influenza as \u0022high\u0022, while 40.5% (163/402) perceived it as \u0022moderate\u0022, 20.6% (107/402) viewed it as \u0022low\u0022 and 7.7% (31/402) indicated that it was \u0022unknown\u0022. The risk perception of males was significantly lower than that of females (p = 0.004) and the risk perception among the students of health sciences was significantly lower than that of students of other sciences (p = 0.037). Within the study group, 72.1% (290/402) indicated that their main information source regarding H1N1 was the mass media. Health sciences students tended to rely more on the internet as an information source than other students (p = 0.015). The vast majority (92.8%; 373/402) of those interviewed indicated that they would not be vaccinated. The major concerns regarding vaccination had to do with the safety and side effects of the vaccine. Most of the participants (343/402, 85.3%) were carrying out one of prevention measures and the vast majority believed that hand washing, face mask and quarantina were effective measures for prevention. CONCLUSION: The participants had enough knowledge about H1N1 pandemic about the disease although there were still gaps and confusions in some areas. In the future, when planning management strategies regarding pandemics or outbreaks in higher education institutions, new strategies should be developed to promote positive health behaviour among university students compatible with the international guidelines. Main information source is mass media, so it seems that new policies must be developed to attract attention of students to use different and more scientific-based information sources.","publish_time":"2010-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akan, Hulya; Gurol, Yesim; Izbirak, Guldal; Ozdatl\u0131, Sukran; Yilmaz, Gulden; Vitrinel, Ayca; Hayran, Osman","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/545def8771357b4cb2875f5795a0760e97534cc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2918554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Yeditepe University"],"locations":["Istanbul","Turkey"],"keyphrases":["Health sciences students","students of health sciences","attention of students","university students compatible","university club of students","year university students","influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","H1N1 pandemic","prevention measures","Yeditepe University","university students\u0027 knowledge","main information source","health related sciences","personal risk of influenza","effective measures","preventive measures","study group","higher education institutions","attitudes","level of knowledge","management strategies","positive health behaviour","new strategies","outbreak management","vaccination","mass media","risk perception of males","vast majority","cross-sectional study","participants","scientific-based information sources","disease control","new policies","self-administered questionnaire","serious outbreak centers","large populations of young adults","quarantina","outbreaks","face mask","hand washing","pandemics","perceptions","Istanbul","socio-demographic characteristics","international guidelines","SANITAS","Data","safety","Turkey","effects","vaccine","major concerns","METHODS","future","CONCLUSION","females","internet","BACKGROUND","confusions","areas","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation.

While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. SUMMARY: COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Han; Rhee, June-Wha; Cheng, Paul; Waliany, Sarah; Chang, Amy; Witteles, Ronald M.; Maecker, Holden; Davis, Mark M.; Nguyen, Patricia K.; Wu, Sean M.","journal":"Curr Cardiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f12a115ffa060877bd7a292df682bac1b99a8193.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318865/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new cardiac injury","mechanism of injury","potential mechanisms of cardiac injury","potential mechanisms of myocardial injury","COVID infection","COVID patients","history of cardiac disease","cardiac disease history","ill COVID","mortality","Development of new onset myocardial injury","viral infection","hypoxia-related myocyte injury","Potential treatments","host immune responses","viral toxicities","Coronavirus disease","excessive immune responses","direct viral entry","host cells","hospital morbidity","number of studies","mechanism of cardiotoxicity","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome","cause of significant morbidity","worsened outcome","epidemiological association","increased risk","ACE2","receptor","angiotensin","biology of SARS","enzyme","permanent damage","SUMMARY","limited data","current knowledge","cardiovascular system","RECENT FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

These plasmids are constructed as cassettes that harbor genes involved in replication and its control, mobilization, resistance determinants and one or two origins of lagging strand synthesis. Any given plasmid may contain all, some, or just only the replication cassette. We discuss here the family of the promiscuous streptococcal plasmid pMV158, with emphasis on its mobilization functions: the product of the mobM gene, prototype of the MOB(V) relaxase family, and its cognate origin of transfer, oriT. Amongst the subfamily of MOB(V1) plasmids, three groups of oriT sequences, represented by plasmids pMV158, pT181, and p1414 were identified. In the same subfamily, we found four types of single-strand origins, namely ssoA, ssoU, ssoW, and ssoT. We found that plasmids of the rolling-circle Rep_2 family (to which pMV158 belongs) are more frequently found in Lactobacillales than in any other bacterial order, whereas Rep_1 initiators seemed to prefer hosts included in the Bacillales order. In parallel, MOB(V1) relaxases associated with Rep_2 initiators tended to cluster separately from those linked to Rep_1 plasmids. The updated inventory of MOB(V1) plasmids still contains exclusively mobilizable elements, since no genes associated with conjugative transfer (other than the relaxase) were detected.

Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as crucial sentinels of microbial and non-infectious antigens throughout the respiratory tract and mediate host innate immunity. Selective induction of inflammatory responses to harmful environmental exposures and tolerance to innocuous antigens are required to maintain tissue homeostasis and integrity. Conversely, dysregulated innate immune responses manifest as sustained and self-perpetuating tissue damage rather than controlled tissue repair.

One class of antiviral compounds, nucleoside analogues, mimics naturally occurring nucleosides to inhibit viral replication. While these compounds have been successful therapeutics for several viral infections, mutagenic nucleoside analogues, such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil, have been ineffective at inhibiting CoVs. This has been attributed to the proofreading activity of the viral 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN). \u03B2-d-N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) (EIDD-1931; Emory Institute for Drug Development) has recently been reported to inhibit multiple viruses. Here, we demonstrate that NHC inhibits both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 0.17 \u03BCM) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (EC(50) = 0.56 \u03BCM) with minimal cytotoxicity. NHC inhibited MHV lacking ExoN proofreading activity similarly to wild-type (WT) MHV, suggesting an ability to evade or overcome ExoN activity. NHC inhibited MHV only when added early during infection, decreased viral specific infectivity, and increased the number and proportion of G:A and C:U transition mutations present after a single infection. Low-level NHC resistance was difficult to achieve and was associated with multiple transition mutations across the genome in both MHV and MERS-CoV. These results point to a virus-mutagenic mechanism of NHC inhibition in CoVs and indicate a high genetic barrier to NHC resistance. Together, the data support further development of NHC for treatment of CoVs and suggest a novel mechanism of NHC interaction with the CoV replication complex that may shed light on critical aspects of replication. IMPORTANCE The emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) into human populations from animal reservoirs has demonstrated their epidemic capability, pandemic potential, and ability to cause severe disease. However, no antivirals have been approved to treat these infections. Here, we demonstrate the potent antiviral activity of a broad-spectrum ribonucleoside analogue, \u03B2-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), against two divergent CoVs. Viral proofreading activity does not markedly impact sensitivity to NHC inhibition, suggesting a novel interaction between a nucleoside analogue inhibitor and the CoV replicase. Further, passage in the presence of NHC generates only low-level resistance, likely due to the accumulation of multiple potentially deleterious transition mutations. Together, these data support a mutagenic mechanism of inhibition by NHC and further support the development of NHC for treatment of CoV infections.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agostini, Maria L.; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Chappell, James D.; Gribble, Jennifer; Lu, Xiaotao; Andres, Erica L.; Bluemling, Gregory R.; Lockwood, Mark A.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Sims, Amy C.; Natchus, Michael G.; Saindane, Manohar; Kolykhalov, Alexander A.; Painter, George R.; Baric, Ralph S.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dcf0124cf00dbf2e2bf0025fee1bba8a57f81da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6880162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578288/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01348-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emory Institute for Drug Development","EC","MHV","NHC"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["development of NHC","presence of NHC","NHC inhibited MHV","Low-level NHC resistance","novel mechanism of NHC interaction","virus-mutagenic mechanism of NHC inhibition","viral infections","Viral proofreading activity","MERS-CoV","treatment of CoVs","treatment of CoV infections","viral replication","ExoN activity","CoV replicase","inhibiting CoVs","divergent CoVs","CoV replication complex","mutagenic mechanism of inhibition","multiple transition mutations","mutagenic nucleoside analogues","potent antiviral activity","low-level resistance","data support","deleterious transition mutations","viral specific infectivity","nucleoside analogue inhibitor","novel interaction","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","animal reservoirs","U transition mutations present","accumulation of multiple","Drug Development","\u03BCM","severe disease","\u03B2-d","multiple viruses","Hydroxycytidine","class of antiviral compounds","critical aspects of replication","FDA-approved antivirals","single infection","lethal disease","emergence of coronaviruses","broad-spectrum ribonucleoside analogue","murine hepatitis virus","light","mimics","epidemic capability","high genetic barrier","human populations","nucleosides","genome","pandemic potential","wild-type","successful therapeutics","number","Emory Institute","WT","EIDD","ribavirin","sensitivity","proportion of G","fluorouracil","humans","effective concentration","IMPORTANCE","minimal cytotoxicity","results","passage","exoribonuclease"],"language":"en"},

We have studied the occurrence of a broad panel of respiratory viruses in apparently healthy children attending day care, taking into account the influence of possible confounding factors, such as age, clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (RTI), location (day-care section) and season. METHODS: We have studied 161 children in two day-care centers, each with separate sections for younger and older children, during four autumn and winter visits over a two-year period. A total of 355 clinical examinations were performed, and 343 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were analyzed by semi-quantitative, real-time, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for 19 respiratory pathogens. RESULT: Forty-three percent of all NPS were PCR-positive for \u2265 1 of 13 virus species, with high species variation during visits. Rhinovirus 26% (88/343 NPS), enterovirus 12% (40/343) and parechovirus 9% (30/343) were detected in every visit, and the rates varied in relation to age, day-care section and season. Ten other viruses were detected in \u2264 3% of the NPS. Generally, viruses occurred together in the NPS. In 24% (79/331) of the clinical examinations with available NPS, the children had clear signs of RTI, while in 41% (135/331) they had mild signs, and in 35% (117/331) the children had no signs of RTI. Moreover, viruses were found in 70% (55/79) of children with clear signs of RTI, in 41% (55/135) with mild signs and in 30% (35/117) without any signs of RTI (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive PCR tests for respiratory viruses, particularly picornaviruses, were frequently detected in apparently healthy children attending day care. Virus detection rates were related to age, presence of clinical signs of RTI, location in day care and season.","publish_time":"2016-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moe, Nina; Pedersen, B\u00E5rd; Nordb\u00F8, Svein Arne; Skanke, Lars H\u00F8s\u00F8ien; Krokstad, Sidsel; Smyrnaios, Anastasios; D\u00F8llner, Henrik","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0f39f2d61d66f276287f181454ae85cdafb7ffa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4951077.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinovirus"],"organizations":["NPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clear signs of RTI","healthy children","older children","asymptomatic children","presence of clinical signs of RTI","mild signs","clinical signs of respiratory tract infection","broad panel of respiratory viruses","respiratory pathogens","available NPS","age","day care","clinical examinations","season","PCR-positive","day-care section","Positive PCR tests","location","virus species","day-care centers","Virus detection rates","winter visits","high species variation","polymerase chain reaction","account","separate sections","influence of possible confounding factors","autumn","relation","CONCLUSIONS","knowledge","two-year period","occurrence","percent","picornaviruses","nasopharyngeal samples","RESULT","total","BACKGROUND","Rhinovirus","enterovirus","METHODS","parechovirus"],"language":"en"},

Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. METHODS: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. RESULTS: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent\u2013target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the target\u2013constituent\u2013disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung\u2013Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney\u2013Urinary Bladder and Stomach\u2013Spleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CL(pro) inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. CONCLUSION: RDS acts primarily in the Lung\u2013Large Intestine, Kidney\u2013Urinary Bladder and Stomach\u2013Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS\u2019s dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating. This results in general therapeutic effects for early COVID-19 control and prevention.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zi-jia; Wu, Wen-yong; Hou, Jin-jun; Zhang, Lin-lin; Li, Fei-fei; Gao, Lei; Wu, Xing-dong; Shi, Jing-ying; Zhang, Rong; Long, Hua-li; Lei, Min; Wu, Wan-ying; Guo, De-an; Chen, Kai-xian; Hofmann, Lewis A.; Ci, Zhong-hua","journal":"J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc747e718ce54ac7f2a974a9a13599f68baf99cb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/496a85509fce73e0f8a8408599e61c8ecd6f63be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195604.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307268/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095496420300364; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095496420300364; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","RDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targets of RDS","analysis of RDS","RDS formula","disease network","chemical constituents of RDS","active constituents of RDS","disease pathways-meridians","coronavirus disease","disease control","target network","aqueous decoction of RDS","disease-related pathways","crucial disease pathways","compounds-targets","PPI network","candidate constituents","validated compounds","Spleen meridians","Large Intestine meridians","network pharmacological study","corresponding compounds","established TCM databases","Urinary Bladder","predicted targets","target prediction","Kidney","Stomach","general therapeutic effects","cluster analysis","hub genes","RESULTS","prevention","presence","ingredients","context of TCM meridian theory","Lung-toxin Dispelling Formula","entire Zang-fu viscera","core regulatory effects","data-independent analysis mode","protein interaction","RDS\u2019s dual effects of health","early COVID","targeted approaches","SARS-coronavirus","mechanisms of action","present study","action mechanism of","validation of molecular docking predictions","Therapeutic benefits","high binding affinity","total","reference standards","multiple components","liquid chromatography mass spectrometry","classical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine","material foundation","theoretical understanding of herbal properties","integrative analytical platform","drug-likeness screening","computational pattern recognition","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","effort","abundance","samples","bioinformatic programs","networks","Respiratory Detox Shot","intricate connections","activity","inhibition assay","protease","chymotrypsin","goal","pathogen","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to predict the effects of risk-factor trends on COPD, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. METHODS: We used representative data sources to estimate past trends in smoking and household solid-fuel use and to construct a range of future scenarios. We obtained the aetiological effects of risk factors on diseases from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies and from large studies in China. We modelled future COPD and lung cancer mortality and tuberculosis incidence, taking into account the accumulation of hazardous effects of risk factors on COPD and lung cancer over time, and dependency of the risk of tuberculosis infection on the prevalence of disease. We quantified the sensitivity of our results to methods and data choices. FINDINGS: If smoking and solid-fuel use remain at current levels between 2003 and 2033, 65 million deaths from COPD and 18 million deaths from lung cancer are predicted in China; 82% of COPD deaths and 75% of lung cancer deaths will be attributable to the combined effects of smoking and solid-fuel use. Complete gradual cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 could avoid 26 million deaths from COPD and 6\u00B73 million deaths from lung cancer; interventions of intermediate magnitude would reduce deaths by 6\u221231% (COPD) and 8\u221226% (lung cancer). Complete cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 would reduce the projected annual tuberculosis incidence in 2033 by 14\u221252% if 80% DOTS coverage is sustained, 27\u221262% if 50% coverage is sustained, or 33\u221271% if 20% coverage is sustained. INTERPRETATION: Reducing smoking and solid-fuel use can substantially lower predictions of COPD and lung cancer burden and would contribute to effective tuberculosis control in China.

Cell tropism and host range is determined in part by the coronavirus spike (S) protein(4), which binds cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion. As the largest known class I fusion protein, its size and extensive glycosylation have hindered structural studies of the full ectodomain, thus preventing a molecular understanding of its function and limiting development of effective interventions. Here we present the 4.0 \u00C5 resolution structure of the trimeric HKU1 S protein determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. In the prefusion conformation, the receptor-binding subunits, S1, rest atop the fusion-mediating subunits, S2, preventing their conformational rearrangement. Surprisingly, the S1 C-terminal domains are interdigitated and form extensive quaternary interactions that occlude surfaces known to bind protein receptors in other coronaviruses. These features, along with the location of the two protease sites known to be important for coronavirus entry, provide a structural basis to support a model of membrane fusion mediated by progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage. Additionally, these studies should serve as a foundation for the structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Cottrell, Christopher A.; Wang, Nianshuang; Pallesen, Jesper; Yassine, Hadi M.; Turner, Hannah L.; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Graham, Barney S.; McLellan, Jason S.; Ward, Andrew B.","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af027d237d28a214db31b89c67047d49cf6e4a5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4860016.xml.json","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17200.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26935699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion protein","protein receptors","trimeric HKU1 S protein","progressive S protein destabilization","fusion-mediating subunits","model of membrane fusion","receptor binding","receptor-binding subunits","structural studies","largest known class","extensive glycosylation","human betacoronavirus","structural basis","coronavirus entry","coronavirus spike","cellular receptors","structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens","\u00C5 resolution structure","extensive quaternary interactions","S1 C-terminal domains","rest","size","single-particle cryo-electron microscopy","function","high fatality rates","S2","surfaces","proteolytic cleavage","betacoronaviruses","pandemic potential","prevalent respiratory disease","ectodomain","foundation","molecular understanding","protease sites","prefusion conformation","development of effective interventions","MERS","location","Cell tropism","host range","conformational rearrangement","zoonotic SARS","features"],"language":"en"},

Previously studies have demonstrated that the mammarenavirus and hantavirus carried by rodents or shrews could cause diseases in human population. To determine the distribution of zoonotic viruses in Shenzhen city, the major city in southern China with a high population density, we analyzed 225 rodents (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus flavipectus) and 196 shrews (Suncus murinus) from urban and rural districts for the presence of mammarenavirus, hantavirus, and hepatitis E virus (HEV) by RT-PCR targeting the conserved regions. The infection rates for mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and HEV in rodents and shrews were 3.56%, 6.89%, and 1.66%, respectively. Partial genome fragment analysis indicated that mammarenavirus and hantavirus strains had more than 90% and 99% nucleic acid identity with Cardamones virus and Seoul virus, respectively, which cause diseases in humans. Although the present HEV strains identified are typically found worldwide, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a divergence of 16%. To our knowledge, the present work is the first report of the prevalence of mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and rat HEV strains in rodents and shrews from Shenzhen city, China. Our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of rodent- and shrew-borne mammarenavirus and hantavirus, and the biodiversity of rat HEV isolates in Shenzhen city. The present work suggests that utilization of good hygiene habits is important to minimize the risk of zoonosis.","publish_time":"2017-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Bo; Cai, Chun-Lin; Li, Bei; Zhang, Wei; Zhu, Yan; Chen, Wei-Hong; Zhuo, Fei; Shi, Zheng-Li; Yang, Xing-Lou","journal":"Virologica Sinica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/633e89365f800d4e5c888ad2e2d8e580a7843065.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6598888.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12250-017-3973-z.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28721632/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-017-3973-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shenzhen","China"],"keyphrases":["shrews","present HEV strains","Shenzhen city","presence of mammarenavirus","prevalence of mammarenavirus","hantavirus strains","rat HEV strains","major city","present work","human viruses","Diverse species of rodents","distribution of zoonotic viruses","biodiversity of rat HEV isolates","Cardamones virus","Seoul virus","hantaviruses","zoonotic potential of rodent","human population","diseases","variety of viruses","hepatitis E virus","southern China","Rattus flavipectus","Rattus norvegicus","phylogenetic analysis","high population density","Partial genome fragment analysis","utilization of good hygiene habits","rural districts","nucleic acid identity","Suncus murinus","RT-PCR","report","conserved regions","findings","infection rates","risk of zoonosis","divergence","knowledge","humans","studies"],"language":"en"},

To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining. Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death. Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed. Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified. There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material. Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes. Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules. In addition to the direct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, factors contributing to acute kidney injury included systemic hypoxia, abnormal coagulation, and possible drug or hyperventilation-relevant rhabdomyolysis. Thus, our studies provide direct evidence of the invasion of SARSCoV-2 into kidney tissue.

(2012) Antivirals in seasonal and pandemic influenza\u2014future perspectives. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(Suppl. 1), 76\u201380. Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials. Examples of these novel antiviral drugs and the challenges for influenza antiviral drug development are discussed in this article.","publish_time":"2012-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wathen, Michael W.; Barro, Mario; Bright, Rick A.","journal":"Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9224d443e92d462370c773c9f98f4fcb1a21a084.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5978628.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23279900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","treatment of influenza disease","classes of drugs","influenza antiviral drug development","novel antiviral drugs","Additional antiviral drugs","landscape of drugs","past influenza seasonal outbreaks","neuraminidase inhibitors","M2 inhibitors","face of drug resistance","widespread resistance","limited number of drug classes","early phases of pandemic","viral replication","viral functions","important option","advanced development","novel mechanisms of action","challenges","attachment","entry","polymerase","transcription","host factors","fusion","Antivirals","future perspectives","clinical trials","issues","Examples","Wathen","article","Respiratory Viruses","paper","years"],"language":"en"},

To overcome this challenge, we combined live-cell imaging and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy of whole cells to capture emerging enterovirus ROs. The first foci of fluorescently labeled viral protein correlated with ROs connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preceded the appearance of ROs stemming from the trans-Golgi network. Whole-cell data sets further revealed striking contact regions between ROs and lipid droplets that may represent a route for lipid shuttling to facilitate RO proliferation and genome replication.

We have previously shown that conditioned media from infected glial cell cultures (supernatants) contain a factor unrelated to infectious virus and capable of inducing H-2 class I antigens on uninfected glial cells. The synthesis of this factor appears to be dependent on production of infectious virus since the H-2 inducing activity could not be detected 3 days following the addition of neutralizing antibodies to the cultures. This suggests that H-2 inducing activity contains as unstable component, the synthesis of which is dependent on continual virus production.

Phylogenetic analyses of amplified ORF1b gene segments identified at least six distinct genetic lineages (genotypes). Genotype 1 (YHV) was detected only in shrimp with yellow head disease. Genotype 2 (GAV) was detected in diseased shrimp with the less severe condition described as mid-crop mortality syndrome and in healthy shrimp from Australia, Thailand and Vietnam. Other genotypes occurred commonly in healthy shrimp. Sequence comparisons of structural protein genes (ORF2 and ORF3), intergenic regions (IGRs) and the long 3\u2032-UTR supported the delineation of genotypes and identified both conserved and variant structural features. In putative transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) encompassing the sub-genomic mRNA 5\u2032-termini, a core motif (5\u2032-GUCAAUUACAAC-3\u2032) is absolutely conserved. A small (83 nt) open reading frame (ORF4) in the 3\u2032-UTR of GAV is variously truncated in all other genotypes and a TRS-like element preceding ORF4 is invariably corrupted by a A \u003E G/U substitution in the central core motif (5\u2032-UU(G/U)CAAC-3\u2032). The data support previous evidence that ORF4 is a non-functional gene under construction or deconstruction. The 3\u2032-UTRs also contain predicted 3\u2032-terminal hairpin-loop structures that are preserved in all genotypes by compensatory nucleotide substitutions, suggesting a role in polymerase recognition for minus-strand RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2008-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wijegoonawardane, Priyanjalie K.M.; Cowley, Jeff A.; Phan, Thuy; Hodgson, Richard A.J.; Nielsen, Linda; Kiatpathomchai, Wansika; Walker, Peter J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c5fbfd4840c2689fbec7ae1fcd204fbc937b7b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103379.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18768192/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220800442X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220800442X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.07.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genotype","GAV"],"locations":["Australia","Thailand","Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["healthy shrimp","diseased shrimp","delineation of genotypes","Abstract Penaeus monodon shrimp","UTR of GAV","element preceding ORF4","central core motif","yellow head disease","non-functional gene","U substitution","presence of yellow head-related viruses","variant structural features","Sequence comparisons of structural protein genes","Phylogenetic analyses of amplified ORF1b gene segments","ORF3","ORF2","mid-crop mortality syndrome","severe condition","TRSs","role","polymerase recognition","minus-strand RNA synthesis","termini","distinct genetic lineages","Australia","data support previous evidence","open reading frame","intergenic regions","sub-genomic mRNA","compensatory nucleotide substitutions","sequences","IGRs","Thailand","terminal hairpin-loop structures","putative transcription","deconstruction","Vietnam","Indo-Pacific region","GUCAAUUACAAC","YHV","UTRs"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We based our approach on established rapid review methods, which were incorporated into existing WHO guideline development processes. Guidance was further informed by in-depth discussions of issues related to rapid guideline development with WHO staff (n = 6), who oversee the Organization\u0027s response to emergencies. RESULTS: We discuss criteria for considering if a rapid advice guideline is appropriate and feasible and outline the roles of various contributors across the phases of development. Further, we describe the methods and steps involved in performing rapid reviews, which are more fluid and iterative than for a standard guideline process. In general, rapid advice guidelines involve a shorter timeline, narrower scope, and the use of abbreviated methods for the evidence review. CONCLUSION: Important differences exist between developing a standard guideline and a rapid advice guideline. However, the core principles for WHO guidelines apply to rapid advice guidelines including minimizing bias, applying transparent processes and the use of explicit methods.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garritty, Chantelle M.; Norris, Susan L.; Moher, David","journal":"J Clin Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/998548cf6bc83b4dfc9d061a2a4425cc9506e82e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125868.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2016.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591906/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435616303869; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435616303869","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rapid guideline development","rapid advice guidelines","rapid reviews","guideline developers","guideline development processes","standard guideline process","established rapid review methods","use of abbreviated methods","use of explicit methods","phases of development","established guidance","transparent processes","World Health Organization","public health emergency","shorter timeline","minimizing bias","context","narrower scope","approach","roles of various contributors","in-depth discussions of issues","fluid","staff","procedures","Important differences","SETTING","evidence","steps","criteria","core principles","Organization\u0027s response","emergencies","STUDY DESIGN","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","Ebola epidemic","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Like the course of a virus infection, pathogenesis is determined by the balance between host and virus factors. Not all the pathogenic symptoms seen in virus infections are caused directly by the virus but are side effects of the immune response. In the past few decades, molecular genetic analysis has contributed enormously in understanding the virus pathogenesis. In the chapter, three major aspects of virus pathogenesis are considered: direct cell damage resulting from virus replication, damage resulting from immune activation or suppression, and cell transformation caused by viruses. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of cellular injury, virus-induced immunodeficiency, virus-related diseases, bacteriophages, and cell transformation by viruses, retroviruses, and DNA viruses. The chapter ends with a discussion of new pathogenic viruses that are being discovered all the time, and changes in human activities that have resulted in the emergence of new or previously unrecognized diseases.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cann, Alan J.","journal":"Principles of Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88f7c3b22a2d2ddbad1c07b3e4fdc4232098a40f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149512.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123849397100079; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123849397100079","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","virus infections","virus factors","Publisher Summary Virus pathogenesis","major aspects of virus pathogenesis","virus-induced immunodeficiency","chapter","cell transformation","DNA viruses","discussion of new pathogenic viruses","direct cell damage","virus-related diseases","immune activation","unrecognized diseases","emergence of new","immune response","pathogenic symptoms","bacteriophages","complex","mechanisms of cellular injury","variable","suppression","retroviruses","past","decades","molecular genetic analysis","balance","human activities","time","changes","host","effects","course","rare state"],"language":"en"},

In humans, coronaviruses are included in the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is a zoonosis. This chapter explains that the family Coronaviridae is included with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae in the order nidovirales; viruses in these three families share a distinctive replication strategy. The genus Coronavirus contains a substantial number of pathogens of mammals and birds that individually cause a remarkable variety of diseases, including pneumonia, reproductive disease, enteritis, polyserositis, sialodacryoadenitis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, nephritis, and various other disorders. The genus Coronavirus can be subdivided into at least three cluster groups on the basis of genetic and serologic properties, with subgroups in two of these. Group 1a includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, ferret and mink coronaviruses, and spotted hyena coronavirus. Group 1b includes certain human coronaviruses, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and bat coronavirus. Group 2a includes mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus of rats, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, and other human coronaviruses.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify lncRNAs in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and evaluate their transcriptomic regulation during ISA virus (ISAV) infection, an Orthomyxoviridae virus associated with high mortalities in salmonid aquaculture. Using next-generation sequencing, whole-transcriptome analysis of the Salmo salar response to ISAV infection was performed, identifying 5,636 putative lncRNAs with a mean length of 695 base pairs. The transcriptional modulation evidenced a similar number of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the gills (3,294), head-kidney (3,275), and liver (3,325) over the course of the infection. Moreover, analysis of a subset of these lncRNAs showed the following: (i) Most were similarly regulated in response to ISA virus infection; (ii) The transcript subsets were uniquely modulated in each tissue (gills, liver, and head-kidney); and (iii) A subset of lncRNAs were upregulated for each tissue and time analysed, indicating potential markers for ISAV infection. These findings represent the first discovery of widespread differential expression of lncRNAs in response to virus infection in non-model species, suggesting that lncRNAs could be involved in regulating the host response during ISAV infection.","publish_time":"2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolta\u00F1a, Sebastian; Valenzuela-Miranda, Diego; Aguilar, Andrea; Mackenzie, Simon; Gallardo-Esc\u00E1rate, Cristian","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8213f353876b2eba6110eae70dae057a2f08b93f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4778034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26939752/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep22698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISAV"],"locations":["Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["ISAV infection","subset of lncRNAs","ISA virus infection","putative lncRNAs","host response","Salmo salar response","Orthomyxoviridae virus","discovery of widespread differential expression of lncRNAs","tissue","liver","gills","head-kidney","transcriptome analysis","non-model species","long non-coding RNAs","roles","potential markers","transcriptomic regulation","high mortalities","mean length","time analysed","Atlantic salmon","similar number","participation","salmonid aquaculture","transcriptional modulation","base pairs","generation sequencing","study","evidence","findings","transcript subsets","following","course","aims"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of EF (WEF) and its components were evaluated in vitro. We found that pretreatment with WEF markedly reduced viral replication, as evaluated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged virus (influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus) in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. We demonstrated that WEF induces the production of type I IFN including pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we identified the active anti-viral components of WEF as quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin. Thus, WEF and its active components are immunomodulators of the innate immune response in murine macrophages, a finding that is potentially useful to developing prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against a range of viruses.","publish_time":"2017-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Jang-Gi; Lee, Heeeun; Hwang, Youn-Hwan; Lee, Jong-Soo; Cho, Won-Kyung; Ma, Jin Yeul","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5a4d0cd6846bf609769f3274a5cbf22b11b14a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5541272.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824435/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2017.00511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EF","Newcastle","WEF"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["active anti-viral components of WEF","active components","effect of EF","anti-oxidant activities","vesicular stomatitis virus","Newcastle disease virus","aqueous extract of EF","murine macrophages","viral replication","range of viruses","malignant metastatic human cancers","innate immune response","mechanism of action","immunomodulators","influenza","quercetin","anti-angiogenic","Korea","China","IFN","antiviral activity","therapeutic treatments","GFP","production of type","Asian countries","pro-inflammatory cytokines","finding","psoralen","green fluorescent protein","present study","macrophage cells","herbal medicine","pretreatment","variety of diseases","Recent studies","quercitrin","Eupatorium fortunei"],"language":"en"},

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients\u2019 clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin colonization. The median age was 64 years (14\u201388) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient\u2019s cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin B (33%) minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), but had low echinocandin and voriconazole MICs.

Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. RESULTS: Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality (p = 0.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (p = 0.0464). The most common reason for DLB was to assess for structural airway abnormality. Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. CONCLUSIONS: Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niermeyer, Weston L.; Ball, Jessica; Worobetz, Noah; Bourgeois, Tran; Onwuka, Amanda; Burrier, Candice; Chiang, Tendy","journal":"Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6b0daaa78cd0437943c7d74214defdc73aeb728.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172690.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388322/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620302007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620302007?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVP","DLB","URI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive RVP","RVP results","negative RVP","RVP positivity","RVP positive testing","RVP negative encounters","Major perioperative complications","major complications","DLB findings","inpatient DLB","concerns of perioperative complications","DLB indication","respiratory distress","Respiratory viral panels","Viral testing results","diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection","active viral infection","pediatric patient encounters","history of recurrent upper respiratory infections","stridor","inpatient children","differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction","incidence of major","anatomic airway abnormality","structural airway abnormality","complex patient group","operative findings","pediatric patients","management of complex","presence of recent","presence of URI symptoms","surgical intervention","URTI","retrospective chart review","specific pathogens","CONCLUSIONS","postponement of surgery","minor complication","acute illness","METHODS","otolaryngologist","direct laryngoscopy","bronchoscopy","study","reintubation","OBJECTIVES","common reason","association","Laryngospasm"],"language":"en"},

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Filoviridae Study Group and other experts have recently established an almost consistent classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Here, further guidelines are suggested to include their natural genetic variants. First, this term is defined. Second, a template for full-length virus names (such as \u201CEbola virus H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit-9510621\u201D) is proposed. These names contain information on the identity of the virus (e.g., Ebola virus), isolation host (e.g., members of the species Homo sapiens), sampling location (e.g., Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD)), sampling year, genetic variant (e.g., Kikwit), and isolate (e.g., 9510621). Suffixes are proposed for individual names that clarify whether a given genetic variant has been characterized based on passage zero material (-wt), has been passaged in tissue/cell culture (-tc), is known from consensus sequence fragments only (-frag), or does (most likely) not exist anymore (-hist). We suggest that these comprehensive names are to be used specifically in the methods section of publications. Suitable abbreviations, also proposed here, could then be used throughout the text, while the full names could be used again in phylograms, tables, or figures if the contained information aids the interpretation of presented data. The proposed system is very similar to the well-known influenzavirus nomenclature and the nomenclature recently proposed for rotaviruses. If applied consistently, it would considerably simplify retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases and be a first important step toward a viral genome annotation standard as sought by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Furthermore, adoption of this nomenclature would increase the general understanding of filovirus-related publications and presentations and improve figures such as phylograms, alignments, and diagrams. Most importantly, it would counter the increasing confusion in genetic variant naming due to the identification of ever more sequences through technological breakthroughs in high-throughput sequencing and environmental sampling.","publish_time":"2012-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuhn, Jens H.; Bao, Yiming; Bavari, Sina; Becker, Stephan; Bradfute, Steven; Brister, J.

Owing to its limited use, the value of RT-PCR in the clinical laboratory has not been fully evaluated. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore in 2003, RT-PCR to detect dengue viral RNA was used as a rapid diagnostic tool to differentiate dengue from SARS among patients who presented to a hospital designated to manage and quarantine SARS cases. A total of 343 results for RT-PCR and 439 results for serology were analysed and compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Our experience indicates that RT-PCR for dengue can be set up rapidly in a clinical laboratory, with very sensitive and specific results for the diagnosis of dengue, particularly in the first 5 days from onset of symptoms.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barkham, Timothy M.; Chung, Youne Kow; Tang, Kin Fai; Ooi, Eng Eong","journal":"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d215d9be316bee0ac2e98fc60fa51bad7ec2d0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107224.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003592030500235X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003592030500235X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["laboratory diagnosis of dengue","value of RT","different RT-PCR protocols","clinical laboratory","dengue viral RNA","specific results","quarantine SARS cases","final discharge diagnosis","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Singapore","rapid diagnostic tool","serological assays","hospital","limited use","patients","Summary","days","onset of symptoms","serology","total","experience"],"language":"en"},

Relevant theoretical frameworks remain nascent. PURPOSE: To model associations between trust in information, perceived hygiene effectiveness, knowledge about the causes of influenza, perceived susceptibility and worry, and personal hygiene practices (PHPs) associated with influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional household telephone surveys on avian influenza A/H5N1 (2006) and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) gathered comparable data on trust in formal and informal sources of influenza information, influenza-related knowledge, perceived hygiene effectiveness, worry, perceived susceptibility, and PHPs. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed domain content while confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the extracted factors. The hypothesized model, compiled from different theoretical frameworks, was optimized with structural equation modelling using the A/H5N1 data. The optimized model was then tested against the A/H1N1 dataset. RESULTS: The model was robust across datasets though corresponding path weights differed. Trust in formal information was positively associated with perceived hygiene effectiveness which was positively associated with PHPs in both datasets. Trust in formal information was positively associated with influenza worry in A/H5N1 data, and with knowledge of influenza cause in A/H1N1 data, both variables being positively associated with PHPs. Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry in both datasets. Independent of information trust, perceived influenza susceptibility associated with influenza worry. Worry associated with PHPs in A/H5N1 data only. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of influenza cause and perceived PHP effectiveness were associated with PHPs. Improving trust in formal information should increase PHPs. Worry was significantly associated with PHPs in A/H5N1.","publish_time":"2010-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak; Fielding, Richard","journal":"Int J Behav Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6463593f45c19d4989336f52905704d1ec9b74e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3088805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20949342/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-010-9123-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza worry","PHPs","perceived influenza susceptibility","avian influenza","causes of influenza","pandemic influenza","knowledge of influenza cause","influenza-related knowledge","informal sources of influenza information","perceived susceptibility","perceived hygiene effectiveness","Independent of information trust","H5N1 data","informal information","perceived PHP effectiveness","comparable data","datasets","optimized model","model associations","hypothesized model","personal hygiene practices","H1N1 dataset","confirmatory factor analysis","Exploratory factor analysis","different theoretical frameworks","Relevant theoretical frameworks","domain content","Cross-sectional household telephone surveys","population responses","corresponding path weights","METHODS","public health interventions","structural equation modelling","BACKGROUND","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","variables","RESULTS","extracted factors"],"language":"en"},

Viruses that cause acute disease tend to bear characteristics that make them very contagious, as survival does not derive from chronicity of infection, but spread of disease throughout the herd. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is one of the most contagious viruses known. Upon infection of susceptible species, cloven-hoofed animals, the virus proliferates rapidly and causes a vesicular disease within 2\u20134 days. Disease symptoms resolve by 10 days to 2 weeks and in most cases, virus can no longer be detected. Periods of fever and viremia are usually brief, 1\u20133 days. In vivo control of virus infection and clearance of the virus during and following acute infection is of particular interest. The interaction of this virus with cells mediating the early, innate immune response has been analyzed in a number of recent studies. In most reports, the virus has a distinct inhibitory effect on the response of cells early in infection. Here we review these new data and discuss the dynamics of the interaction of virus with different cell types mediating the immune response to infection.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toka, Felix N.; Golde, William T.","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd9e7b8938d7ca75bf092d2ac53cf01e7bcfd29c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112845.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23727070/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2013.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247813000679; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247813000679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of virus","control of virus infection","mouth disease virus","acute infection","chronicity of infection","acute disease","response of cells","infection of susceptible species","vesicular disease","Disease symptoms","days","immune response of mammalian species","contagious viruses","pathogenic viruses","different cell types","distinct inhibitory effect","cloven-hoofed animals","Abstract Pathogens","dynamics","myriad of mechanisms","clearance","viremia","weeks","characteristics","Foot","FMDV","Periods of fever","number of recent studies","new data","survival","cases","reports","herd"],"language":"en"},

It causes MERS with high mortality rate. However, no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available. Since antiviral activity of some flavonoids is known, we applied a flavonoid library to probe inhibitory compounds against MERS\u2010CoV 3C\u2010like protease (3CLpro). Herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3\u2010\u03B2\u2010d\u2010glucoside and helichrysetin were found to block the enzymatic activity of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. The binding of the four flavonoids was also confirmed independently using a tryptophan\u2010based fluorescence method. The systematic comparison of the binding affinity of flavonoids made it possible to infer their scaffolds and functional groups required to bind with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. An induced\u2010fit docking analysis revealed that S1 and S2 sites play a role in interaction with flavonoids. The experimental and computational study showed that flavonol and chalcone are favourite scaffolds to bind with the catalytic site of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. It was also deduced that some flavonoid derivatives with hydrophobic or carbohydrate attached to their core structures have a good inhibitory effect. Therefore, we suggest that flavonoids with these characteristics can be used as templates to develop potent MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.","publish_time":"2019-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jo, Seri; Kim, Hyojin; Kim, Suwon; Shin, Dong Hae; Kim, Mi\u2010Sun","journal":"Chem Biol Drug Des","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7923a79042dbabb12a0adffe7606fe39d4f85bd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162010.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cbdd.13604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31436895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV","potent MERS","enzymatic activity of MERS","catalytic site of MERS","CLpro inhibitors","binding affinity of flavonoids","inhibitory compounds","favourite scaffolds","flavonoid library","flavonoid derivatives","antiviral activity","good inhibitory effect","S1","flavonol","coronavirus","S2 sites","core structures","fit docking analysis","carbohydrate","role","Middle East respiratory syndrome","zoonotic virus","quercetin","helichrysetin","computational study","animals","interaction","templates","human beings","systematic comparison","functional groups","tryptophan","based fluorescence method","vaccine","specific treatment","isobavachalcone","glucoside","high mortality rate","protease","Herbacetin","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Our broad contention is that, notwithstanding its biomedical reality, TB is socially constructed by, and through, human experience. Further, public health practitioners depend, to a large extent, on the media to alert the public to threats of disease and opportunities for protection. However, the messages conveyed are sometimes neither helpful nor accurate. In our analysis of TB coverage in three major daily newspapers in New Zealand, we enumerate and classify references to the disease, as well as undertake a discursive analysis of the revealed themes. Of the 366 texts we retrieved in the database search, we selected 120 for in-depth analysis. Our examination indicated the importance of bovine TB within the national consciousness, the stigmatised character of TB and the association between TB and immigrants. We observe that newspaper \u2018stories\u2019 in general, and commentaries by public health officials in particular, are invariably offered on a \u2018case by case\u2019 basis. We conclude that this specificity in time and place avoids more challenging discourses linking TB with deeply embedded determinants of health such as the strong link between TB and poverty.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawrence, Jody; Kearns, Robin A.; Park, Julie; Bryder, Linda; Worth, Heather","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8ce3bfb5998240ec5c139c3874e426f55ca82f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131337.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953607005266; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953607005266","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["analysis of TB coverage","stigmatised character of TB","importance of bovine TB","public health practitioners","public health officials","New Zealand","discursive analysis","in-depth analysis","case","embedded determinants of health","print media","threats of disease","major daily newspapers","commentaries","national consciousness","challenging discourses","place","association","recent years","strong link","time","opportunities","large extent","stories\u2019","protection","revealed themes","ways","tuberculosis","examination","poverty","database search","biomedical reality","texts","specificity","basis","references","immigrants","broad contention","human experience","messages"],"language":"en"},

This soluble endonuclease mediates the escape from an interferon (IFN) response in the infected fetus, thereby permitting the establishment of persistent infection. Viral single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA act as potent IFN inducing signals and we previously showed that E(rns) efficiently cleaves these substrates, thereby inhibiting an IFN response that is crucial for successful fetal infection. Considering that a large variety of RNases and DNases require dimerisation to cleave double-stranded substrates, the activity of E(rns) against dsRNA was postulated to depend on homodimer formation mediated by disulfide bonds involving residue Cys171. Here, we show that monomeric E(rns) is equally able to cleave dsRNA and to inhibit dsRNA-induced IFN synthesis as the wild-type form. Furthermore, both forms were able to degrade RNA within a DNA/RNA- as well as within a methylated RNA/RNA-hybrid, with the DNA and the methylated RNA strand being resistant to degradation. These results support our model that E(rns) acts as \u2018nicking endoribonuclease\u2019 degrading ssRNA within double-stranded substrates. This efficiently prevents the activation of IFN and helps to maintain a state of innate immunotolerance in persistently infected animals.","publish_time":"2018-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lussi, Carmela; Sauter, Kay-Sara; Schweizer, Matthias","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e18358325d65bee698980b7433a62923fcca051a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5974291.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29844335/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26557-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rns","IFN response","RNA act","RNA-hybrid","double-stranded substrates","potent IFN","methylated RNA strand","activation of IFN","activity of E","glycoprotein E","monomeric E","dsRNA-induced IFN synthesis","infected fetus","infected animals","successful fetal infection","establishment of persistent infection","pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus","biology","dimerisation","disulfide bonds","BVDV","DNases","ssRNA","signals","homodimer formation","wild-type form","state of innate immunotolerance","escape","interferon","central role","degradation","nicking endoribonuclease","large variety of RNases","residue Cys171","model","soluble endonuclease","results","forms"],"language":"en"},

Methods and Results: An antimicrobial coating based on polymer\u2010encapsulated ClO(2) was developed. A low viscosity, water/oil/water double emulsion coating was formulated for easy on\u2010site application. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were applied onto the coating to study the bactericidal capabilities of the coating. The bactericidal performance of the coating increased when the contact time with the tested bacteria increased. Over 99% of the E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa, B. subtilis were killed with a contact time of 30 min. Although endospores of B. subtilis are more resistant, about 75% of the spores were killed after 72 h on the coating. Moreover, a sustained release of gaseous ClO(2) was achieved to maintain about 90% removal of B. subtilis with a 10\u2010min contact time during a 28\u2010day study period.

However, the investment of resources in primary care institutions is not based on the actual medical demands of the public. This study analysed primary care utilization to provide targeted guidance for the improvement of primary healthcare delivery in China. METHODS: We extracted outpatient visit data from all community healthcare centres in Shanghai from 2014 to 2018. Diseases were then classified according to ICD-10 codes. The disease spectrum (frequency, proportion, rank) was stratified by sex, age, and region. RESULTS: Most primary care outpatients were female (58.20%), 60\u201379 years old (57.91%), and in suburban regions (62.18%). Chronic diseases accounted for the majority (91.41%). Hypertension, chronic ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and acute upper respiratory tract infections were the top four disorders for primary care visits regardless of sex. In the group aged 0\u201318 years, symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings not elsewhere classified accounted for 37.96% of the top 20 reasons. Acute upper respiratory tract infections were the most common diseases in the groups aged 0\u201318 (11.20%) and 19\u201339 (11.14%) years. However, hypertension was the most common disease in the group aged \u003E 39 years old (\u003E 20%). There were more outpatients with respiratory and digestive diseases in suburban areas than in urban areas. In addition, problems associated with medical equipment and other healthcare deficiencies were relatively more common in suburban areas (suburban: 4.13%, rank 5; urban: 2.29%, rank 10). CONCLUSIONS: To meet the patients\u2019 needs and to develop the primary care system, the Shanghai government should focus on diseases with regionally high proportions. Disease diagnosis and treatment should be improved in the younger and suburban populations.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Jianwei; Chi, Chunhua; Gong, Xin; Chen, Chen; Yu, Wenya; Huang, Jiaoling; Zhou, Liang; Chen, Ning; Yang, Yan; Liu, Qian; Wang, Zhaoxin","journal":"BMC Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcc9f077bf64ae93b3be7e93453b04c76b8e13c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190008.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01146-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["primary care institutions","primary care outpatients","primary care system","primary care utilization","primary care visits","common diseases","suburban areas","Chronic diseases","improvement of primary healthcare delivery","healthcare system","digestive diseases","suburban populations","suburban regions","years old","rank","healthcare deficiencies","disease spectrum","Disease diagnosis","acute upper respiratory tract infections","community healthcare centres","chronic ischaemic heart disease","China","sex","Hypertension","medical equipment","Shanghai government","actual medical demands","diabetes","targeted guidance","signs","data","disorders","laboratory findings","symptoms","frequency","investment of resources","gateway","public","addition","problems","treatment","study","RESULTS","female","METHODS","age","ICD","high proportions","patients\u2019","majority","groups","codes","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","reasons"],"language":"en"},

The majority of the outbreaks that were part of this study were in adults (\u003E65 years). Total nucleic acid extraction was done on 123 residual anonymized clinical specimens from 51 different respiratory outbreaks. Specimens were subjected to PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing targeting the F and G genes of hMPV. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify genotypes. HMPV accounted for 195 (8.5%) of 2,292 respiratory outbreaks. Genotype A2b was most prevalent, detected in 28 (54.9%) of 51 typed hMPV\u2010positive outbreaks.

The test is based on a proprietary technology that combines the principles of immunochromatography and fluid dynamics. Gold nanoparticles conjugated to staphylococcal protein A (SPA) were prepared in liquid form and used as signal vehicles. T. gondii-specific recombinant antigens and SPA were sprayed onto a nitrocellulose membrane in strips at positions designated as T and C, respectively. The DFICT is performed by applying a 100 \u00B5L aliquot of liquid gold-SPA conjugate to the reagent hole and a 5 \u03BCL aliquot of serum sample to the sample hole. The results were observable within 5 min by the naked eye. The lowest detectable limit of the assay was determined as the highest dilution (1:320) of positive serum. No cross-reaction of the antibodies with other related canine or feline pathogens was observed. The DFICT can be stored for 12 months at 4 \u00B0C or 6 months with no loss of sensitivity or specificity. A high degree of consistency was observed between the DFICT and the standard ELISA kit, supporting the reliability of the novel test strip. The introduction of a liquid gold nanoparticle conjugate reagent provides this method with several attractive characteristics, such as ease of manufacture, low sample volume requirements, high selectivity and high efficiency. This method opens a novel pathway for rapid diagnostic screening and field analysis.","publish_time":"2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Wei; Liu, Yingchun; Chen, Yongjun; Yang, Qiufeng; Chun, Peter; Yao, Kailing; Han, Xiangan; Wang, Shaohui; Yu, Shengqing; Liu, Yongjie; Wang, Quan","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25978441/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.04.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566315300415; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566315300415","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFICT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DFICT","sample hole","\u00B5L aliquot of liquid gold-SPA conjugate","novel test strip","liquid gold nanoparticle conjugate reagent","high selectivity","rapid assay","reagent hole","novel pathway","\u03BCL aliquot of serum sample","high efficiency","Gold nanoparticles","liquid form","method","months","novel dynamic flow immunochromatographic test","high degree of consistency","low sample volume requirements","Toxoplasma gondii","positive serum","rapid diagnostic screening","gondii-specific recombinant antigens","ease of manufacture","reliability","positions","related canine","principles of immunochromatography","field analysis","antibodies","strips","nitrocellulose membrane","attractive characteristics","standard ELISA kit","staphylococcal protein","introduction","feline pathogens","loss of sensitivity","proprietary technology","fluid dynamics","lowest detectable limit","signal vehicles","model","observable","specificity","cross-reaction","highest dilution","naked eye","results"],"language":"en"},

A marked drop in egg production (55%) was recorded with eggs appearing white and soft-shelled. Mortality was in the range of 1%\u20132% with post-mortem lesions revealing cloudy air sacs, frothy, and congested lungs. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled tissue samples (trachea, lungs, spleen, and liver) and tested for Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, virus isolation was attempted in 9\u201311 day-old embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). In order to determine the prevalence of IBV serotype(s) in the flock, serum samples were screened by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using IBV antigens and antisera (Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts). Neither AIV nor NDV but IBV was detected in the tissue samples by RT-PCR. In addition, virus isolate obtained after four serial passages in ECE produced dwarfed, stunted, and hemorrhagic embryos, and the isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR to be IBV. The serum samples were 100% seropositive for three serotypes with HI titres ranging from 5 to 12 Log(2). In this study, IBV was confirmed as the causative agent of the observed respiratory distress and drop in egg production. Also, the evidence of co-circulation of multiple IBV serotypes was established, this to the best of our knowledge is the first of such report in Nigeria.

Material and Methods The experiment was conducted over 3 yr in eastern Nebraska (ENREC) and 2 yr in western Nebraska (PREC) in a randomized complete block design. Lactating, crossbred beef cows (n = 127 at ENREC; n = 56 at PREC) with summer-born calves were used from November to April. Treatments were (1) dry-lot feeding or (2) cornstalk grazing with supplementation. Dry-lot pairs were limit fed a crop residue and distillers\u2013based diet to meet energy requirements of a lactating cow. A dried distillers grain\u2013based pellet was supplemented to pairs on cornstalks at a rate of 2.4 kg of DM/pair daily. Dry-lot cow-calf pairs were limit fed 12.1 kg of DM/d throughout the trial. Results and Discussion At ENREC, cows wintered on cornstalks lost BW and had a 0.46-unit decrease in BCS (P \u003C 0.01), whereas cows in the dry-lot gained BW and had a 0.24-unit increase in BCS. At PREC, BCS increased by 0.03 units for cows wintered in the dry-lot and decreased by 0.26 units for cows wintered on cornstalks (P \u003C 0.04). At both locations, calves fed in a dry-lot had greater ADG and BW per day of age compared with calves offered cornstalk grazing with supplementation (P \u2264 0.03).

PROCEDURE: Nasopharyngeal wash specimens were prospectively collected from 60 children with sickle cell disease and acute respiratory illness, over a 1-year period. Samples were tested with multiplexed-PCR, using an automated system for nine respiratory viruses, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Clinical characteristics and distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with and without acute chest syndrome (ACS) were evaluated. RESULTS: A respiratory virus was detected in 47 (78%) patients. Nine (15%) patients had ACS; a respiratory virus was detected in all of them. The demographic characteristics of patients with and without ACS were similar. HRV was the most common virus, detected in 29 of 47 (62%) patients. Logistic regression showed no association between ACS and detection of HRV, hCoV, hBoV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens. Co-infection with at least one additional respiratory virus was seen in 14 (30%) infected patients, and was not significantly higher in patients with ACS (P=0.10). Co-infections with more than two respiratory viruses were seen in seven patients, all in patients without ACS. Bacterial pathogens were not detected. CONCLUSION: HRV was the most common virus detected in children with sickle cell disease and acute respiratory illness, and was not associated with increased morbidity. Larger prospective studies with asymptomatic controls are needed to study the association of these emerging respiratory viruses with ACS in children with sickle cell disease.","publish_time":"2013-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Srinivasan, Ashok; Wang, Winfred C.; Gaur, Aditya; Smith, Teresa; Gu, Zhengming; Kang, Guolian; Leung, Wing; Hayden, Randall T.","journal":"Pediatric Blood \u0026 Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd35c5165ddd926062f4f7184d9a92d4581804dd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/da8394be4ec8cb84dae818bb2edd8227680c6313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4632201.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4632201?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24123899/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.24798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":["ACS","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACS","respiratory pathogens","additional respiratory virus","acute respiratory illness","distribution of respiratory viruses","emerging respiratory viruses","infected patients","children","sickle cell disease","demographic characteristics of patients","common virus","human coronavirus","Human rhinovirus","human bocavirus","human metapneumovirus","detection of HRV","hCoV","hBoV","hMPV","association","Co-infections","acute chest syndrome","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","Clinical characteristics","Bacterial pathogens","automated system","asymptomatic controls","Larger prospective studies","multiplexed-PCR","Bordetella pertussis","Nasopharyngeal wash specimens","PROCEDURE","Logistic regression","BACKGROUND","Samples","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","year period","increased morbidity"],"language":"en"},

The sequencing results for the S protein from 10 PDCoV strains showed 96.7 %\u201399.7 % nucleotide sequence identity with the China lineage strains, while sharing a lower level of nucleotide sequence identity, ranging from 95.7 to 96.8%, with the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains. N protein sequencing analysis showed that these strains showed nucleotide homologies of 97.3%\u201399.3% with the reference strains.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People\u0027s Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P \u003C 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P \u003C 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P \u003C 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P \u003C 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P \u003C 0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all \u003C0.05. INTERPRETATION: The mortality of elderly patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients, and the proportion of patients with PSI grade IV and V is significantly higher than that of young and middle-aged patients.

We have previously shown that the poorly characterised E5 oncoprotein forms a virus-coded ion channel or viroporin that was sensitive to the amantadine derivative rimantadine. We now demonstrate that alkylated imino sugars, which have antiviral activity against a number of viruses, inhibit E5 channel activity in vitro. Using molecular modelling we predict that imino sugars intercalate between E5 protomers to prevent channel oligomerisation. We explored the ability of these viroporin inhibitors to block E5-mediated activation of mitogenic signalling in keratinocytes. Treatment with either rimantadine or imino sugars prevented ERK-MAPK phosphorylation and reduced cyclin B1 expression in cells expressing E5 from a number of high-risk HPV types. Moreover, viroporin inhibitors also reduced ERK-MAPK activation and cyclin B1 expression in differentiating primary human keratinocytes containing high-risk HPV18.

This study was to investigate the relationship between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of SARS-CoV infection and its role in prognosis of patients with lung interstitial fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis. METHODS: The association between genetic polymorphisms of TNF-\u03B1 gene and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) was conducted in a hospital-based case-control study including 75 SARS patients, 41 health care workers and 92 healthy controls. Relationships of TNF-\u03B1 gene polymorphisms with interstitial lung fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis were carried out in two case-case studies in discharged SARS patients. PCR sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method was used to determine the polymorphisms of TNF-\u03B1 gene in locus of the promoter region and univariate logistic analysis was conducted in analyzing the collected data. RESULTS: Compared to TT genotype, the CT genotype at the -204 locus was found associated with a protective effect on SARS with OR(95%CI) of 0.95(0.90\u20130.99). Also, TT genotype, CT and CC were found associated with a risk effect on femoral head necrosis with ORs(95%CI) of 5.33(1.39\u201320.45) and 5.67(2.74\u201311.71), respectively and the glucocorticoid adjusted OR of CT was 5.25(95%CI 1.18\u201323.46) and the combined (CT and CC) genotype OR was 6.0 (95%CI 1.60\u201322.55) at -1031 site of TNF-\u03B1 gene. At the same time, the -863 AC genotype was manifested as another risk effect associated with femoral head necrosis with OR(95%CI) of 6.42(1.53\u201326.88) and the adjusted OR was 8.40(95%CI 1.76\u201340.02) in cured SARS patients compared to CC genotype. CONCLUSION: SNPs of TNF-\u03B1 gene of promoter region may not associate with SARS-CoV infection. And these SNPs may not affect interstitial lung fibrosis in cured SARS patients. However, the -1031CT/CC and -863 AC genotypes may be risk factors of femoral head necrosis in discharged SARS patients.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shixin; Wei, Maoti; Han, Yi; Zhang, Keju; He, Li; Yang, Zhen; Su, Bing; Zhang, Zhilun; Hu, Yilan; Hui, Wuli","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e9ccecdd40825f5c30da3a900fc5cf1b063b47d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2291466.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-8-27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18312678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CT","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discharged SARS patients","cured SARS patients","occurrence of SARS","progress of SARS","CT genotype","\u03B1 gene polymorphisms","SARS-CoV infection","CC genotype","\u03B1 gene of promoter region","genetic polymorphisms of TNF","factors of femoral head necrosis","femoral head osteonecrosis","SNPs of TNF","TT genotype","prognosis of patients","Relationships of TNF","site of TNF","lung interstitial fibrosis","interstitial lung fibrosis","risk effect","case-case studies","role","tumor necrosis factor","locus","protective effect","hospital-based case-control study","Host genetic factors","based typing","PCR-SBT","AC genotypes","susceptibility","severe acute respiratory syndromes","health care workers","univariate logistic analysis","healthy controls","association","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION","time","RESULTS","collected data","glucocorticoid"],"language":"en"},

COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinflation. They are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway inflammation. Some patients are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, and show worse health status and faster disease progression than those who have infrequent exacerbations. Several pharmacological interventions are effective for the reduction of exacerbation frequency and severity in COPD such as inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and their combinations. Non-pharmacological therapies such as pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, and home ventilatory support are becoming increasingly important, but still need to be studied in controlled trials. The future of exacerbation prevention is in assessment of optimum combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies that will result in improvement of health status, and reduction of hospital admission and mortality associated with COPD.","publish_time":"2007-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Seemungal, Terence AR","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c904e69b9710894015642d967e2581ec3495b089.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134993.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673607613828; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607613828","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD exacerbations","Non-pharmacological therapies","airway inflammation","pharmacological interventions","infrequent exacerbations","assessment of optimum combinations of pharmacological","increased airway","lower airway","mortality","Summary Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","worse health status","reduction of exacerbation frequency","improvement of health status","pulmonary rehabilitation","systemic inflammation","faster disease progression","reduction of hospital admission","future of exacerbation prevention","self-management","physiological changes","severity","home ventilatory support","inhaled steroids","episodes of worsening","symptoms","acting bronchodilators","bacteria","substantial morbidity","development of hyperinflation","respiratory viruses","patients","controlled trials"],"language":"en"},

Recent detections of circulating serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus in northern Nigeria (Borno and Sokoto states) and Pakistan (Balochistan Province) and serotype 1 wild poliovirus in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (Borno) represent public health emergencies that require aggressive response. METHODS. We demonstrate the importance of undervaccinated subpopulations, using an existing dynamic poliovirus transmission and oral poliovirus vaccine evolution model. We review the lessons learned during the polio endgame about the role of subpopulations in sustaining transmission, and we explore the implications of subpopulations for other vaccine-preventable disease eradication efforts. RESULTS. Relatively isolated subpopulations benefit little from high surrounding population immunity to transmission and will sustain transmission as long as they do not attain high vaccination coverage. Failing to reach such subpopulations with high coverage represents the root cause of polio eradication delays. Achieving and maintaining eradication requires addressing the weakest links, which includes immunizing populations in insecure areas and/or with disrupted or poor-performing health systems and managing the risks of individuals with primary immunodeficiencies who can excrete vaccine-derived poliovirus long-term. CONCLUSIONS. Eradication efforts for vaccine-preventable diseases need to create performance expectations for countries to immunize all people living within their borders and maintain high coverage with appropriate interventions.Keywords.

A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (e.g., atherosclerosis, lung diseases) and tumor diseases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via the tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review provides potential targets associated with TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating diseases.","publish_time":"2020-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Danfeng; Kang, Xiaodiao; Shen, Lu; Tu, Sheng; Lenahan, Cameron; Chen, Yiding; Wang, Xiaochen; Shao, Anwen","journal":"Mol Ther Oncolytics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4eece66ddfa81cdcf0c8de475adf780a8e880ea.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0ecfef63c618aa8b484e5c165e98f6e2613e7f63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186127.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346605/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2372770520300607?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2372770520300607; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tumor diseases","non-tumor","tumor progression","tumor microenvironment","mechanisms of efferocytosis","intact efferocytosis","impaired efferocytosis","dual role of efferocytosis","lung diseases","efferocytosis-related functions","immune-related diseases","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","role of involved cytokines","apoptotic cells","phagocytic cells","Billions of cells","review","immune response","potential targets","abovementioned disorders","defective clearance","breast cancer","prompt clearance","tissue repair","disease progression","prostate cancer","tissue homeostasis","terms of inflammation resolution","growing number of inflammation","potential novel therapeutic ways","CXCL5","paradoxical effect","TYRO3","TAM","debris","AXL","MERTK","receptors","signal molecules","atherosclerosis","disrupted stages","processes","macrophage politzerization","apoptosis","turnover","numerous studies","note","lifetime"],"language":"en"},

PEDV is an alpha-coronavirus replicating primarily in porcine intestinal cells. PEDV vaccines are available in Asia and Europe, and conditionally-licensed vaccines recently became available in the United States but the efficacies of these vaccines in eliminating PEDV from swine populations are questionable. In this study, the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein of PEDV, which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells (DCs) expressing Langerin, was assessed. The PEDV S antigen was delivered to the dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to Langerin and the targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant. This approach, known as \u201Cdendritic cell targeting,\u201D greatly improved PEDV S antigen-specific T cell interferon-\u03B3 responses in the CD4posCD8pos T cell compartment in pigs as early as 7days upon transdermal administration. When the vaccine protein was targeted to Langerinpos DCs systemically through intramuscular vaccination, it induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses in pigs, though these responses require a booster dose, and the magnitude of T cell responses were lower as compared to transdermal vaccination. We conclude that PEDV spike protein domains targeting Langerin-expressing dendritic cells significantly increased CD4 T cell immune responses in pigs. The results indicate that the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines can be greatly enhanced by direct targeting of the vaccine antigens to desirable dendritic cell subsets in pigs.","publish_time":"2017-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramaniam, Sakthivel; Cao, Dianjun; Tian, Debin; Cao, Qian M.; Overend, Christopher; Yugo, Danielle M.; Matzinger, Shannon R.; Rogers, Adam J.; Heffron, C.

In assessing the risks of introduction of these bat-borne zoonotic viruses to the EU, it is important to consider the location and range of bat species known to be susceptible to infection, together with the virus prevalence, seasonality of viral pulses, duration of infection and titre of virus in different bat tissues.

Previous studies have identified interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) as an interferon-stimulated gene family. However, the role of IFITMs in HTNV infection is unclear. In this study, we observed that IFITM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs12252 C allele and CC genotype associated with the disease severity and HTNV load in the plasma of HFRS patients. In vitro experiments showed that the truncated protein produced by the rs12252 C allele exhibited an impaired anti-HTNV activity. We also proved that IFITM3 was able to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells by overexpression and RNAi assays, likely via a mechanism of inhibiting virus entry demonstrated by binding and entry assay. Localization of IFITM3 in late endosomes was also observed. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription of IFITM3 is negatively regulated by an lncRNA negative regulator of interferon response (NRIR). Taken together, we conclude that IFITM3, negatively regulated by NRIR, inhibits HTNV infection, and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the plasma HTNV load and the disease severity of patients with HFRS.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu-yang, Zheng; Pei-yu, Bian; Chuan-tao, Ye; Wei, Ye; Hong-wei, Ma; Kang, Tang; Chun-mei, Zhang; Ying-feng, Lei; Xin, Wei; Ping-zhong, Wang; Chang-xing, Huang; Xue-fan, Bai; Ying, Zhang; Zhan-sheng, Jia","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4328e18bdf9b52875c87f3f5ddb1911636a192d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5206578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CC","HTNV","HFRS","NRIR","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTNV infection","HTNV activity","plasma HTNV load","Localization of IFITM3","transcription of IFITM3","rs12252 C allele","plasma of HFRS patients","SNP rs12252 correlates","disease severity of patients","IFITM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms","NRIR","mechanism of inhibiting virus entry","entry assay","Hantaan virus","interferon-stimulated gene family","role of IFITMs","lncRNA negative regulator of interferon response","A549 cells","hemorrhagic fever","CC genotype","overexpression","RNAi assays","binding","HUVEC","renal syndrome","truncated protein","transmembrane proteins","late endosomes","Previous studies","experiments","study","addition"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to evaluate the status of diseases at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface in the United States. Specifically, the goals of the literature review were three fold: first to evaluate domestic animal diseases currently found in the United States where wildlife may play a role; second to identify critical issues faced in managing these diseases at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface; and third to identify potential technical and policy strategies for addressing these issues. We found that of the 86 avian, ruminant, swine, poultry, and lagomorph diseases that are reportable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 53 are present in the United States; 42 (79%) of these have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission, maintenance, or life cycle of the pathogen; and 21 (40%) are known to be zoonotic. At least six of these reportable diseases\u2014bovine tuberculosis, paratuberculosis, brucellosis, avian influenza, rabies, and cattle fever tick (vector control)\u2014have a wildlife reservoir that is a recognized impediment to eradication in domestic populations. The complex nature of these systems highlights the need to understand the role of wildlife in the epidemiology, transmission, and maintenance of infectious diseases of livestock. Successful management or eradication of these diseases will require the development of cross-discipline and institutional collaborations. Despite social and policy challenges, there remain opportunities to develop new collaborations and new technologies to mitigate the risks posed at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface.","publish_time":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Ryan S.; Farnsworth, Matthew L.; Malmberg, Jennifer L.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9c476e848d4d445022cbf37297026fdecdd0cef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127607.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587712003984; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587712003984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23254245/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.11.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Organization for Animal Health"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["wildlife interface","reportable diseases","role of wildlife","lagomorph diseases","status of diseases","wildlife reservoir","domestic animal diseases","maintenance of infectious diseases of livestock","putative wildlife component","United States","transmission","Animal Health","new collaborations","literature review","eradication","avian influenza","new technologies","scientific literature","policy strategies","institutional collaborations","systematic review","domestic populations","policy challenges","critical issues","paratuberculosis","cattle fever tick","rabies","brucellosis","recognized impediment","vector control","World Organization","bovine tuberculosis","OIE","swine","poultry","opportunities","significant attention","development of cross","half century","discipline","life cycle","need","fold","epidemiology","risks","systems","ruminant","Successful management","understanding of disease processes","complex nature","Abstract","pathogen","study","goals"],"language":"en"},

It has been suggested that differences in innate immunity are responsible. The antiviral OAS-RNase L pathway is well characterized in humans, but there is little known about its activation and antiviral activity in bats. During infection, OASs, upon sensing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), produce 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates (2-5A), leading to activation of RNase L which degrades viral and host RNA, limiting viral replication. Humans encode three active OASs (OAS1 to -3). Analysis of the Egyptian Rousette bat genome combined with mRNA sequencing from bat RoNi/7 cells revealed three homologous OAS proteins. Interferon alpha treatment or viral infection induced all three OAS mRNAs, but RNase L mRNA is constitutively expressed. Sindbis virus (SINV) or vaccinia virus (VACV\u0394E3L) infection of wild-type (WT) or OAS1-KO (knockout), OAS2-KO, or MAVS-KO RoNi/7 cells, but not RNase L-KO or OAS3-KO cells, induces robust RNase L activation. SINV replication is 100- to 200-fold higher in the absence of RNase L or OAS3 than in WT cells. However, MAVS-KO had no detectable effect on RNA degradation or replication. Thus, in RoNi/7 bat cells, as in human cells, activation of RNase L during infection and its antiviral activity are dependent primarily on OAS3 while MAVS signaling is not required for the activation of RNase L and restriction of infection. Our findings indicate that OAS proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize viral dsRNA and that this pathway is a primary response to virus rather than a secondary effect of interferon signaling.","publish_time":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yize; Dong, Beihua; Wei, Zuzhang; Silverman, Robert H.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d1f54f77265414c23216e284e9bdb257a8e7e26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6851283.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02414-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31719180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","MAVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of RNase","OAS3-KO cells","antiviral OAS-RNase","bat cells","viral infection","robust RNase","absence of RNase","WT cells","OAS1-KO","MAVS-KO RoNi","human cells","OAS2-KO","viral replication","infection of wild","viral dsRNA","bat RoNi","restriction of infection","host RNA","humans","RNA viruses","RNA degradation","OAS mRNAs","antiviral activity","SINV replication","homologous OAS proteins","vaccinia virus","Sindbis virus","pathway","Bats","sensing double-stranded RNA","secondary effect of interferon","mRNA sequencing","Egyptian Rousette bat genome","detectable effect","active OASs","natural host","Interferon alpha treatment","VACV\u0394E3L","pattern recognition receptors","PRRs","type","Analysis","apathogenic","knockout","primary response","differences","innate immunity","reservoirs","findings","oligoadenylates"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to quantify the absolute effects of these viral exposures. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review (across 7 databases) of case\u2013control studies published from 1990 to 2014 which investigated the viral profile of 18592 children under 5 years with and without ALRI. We then computed a pooled odds ratio and virus\u2013specific attributable fraction among the exposed of 8 common viruses \u2013 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (IFV), parainfluenza (PIV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV). FINDINGS: From the 23 studies included, there was strong evidence for causal attribution of RSV (OR 9.79; AFE 90%), IFV (OR 5.10; AFE 80%), PIV (OR 3.37; AFE 70%) and MPV (OR 3.76; AFE 73%), and less strong evidence for RV (OR 1.43; AFE 30%) in young children presenting with ALRI compared to those without respiratory symptoms (asymptomatic) or healthy children. However, there was no significant difference in the detection of AdV, BoV, or CoV in cases and controls.

Levels of IL\u20104, IL\u20105 and IFN\u2010\u03B3 were determined by ELISA. Results: Patients with influenza virus infection demonstrated significantly lower IL\u20104 and IL\u20105 levels than those with other three groups.

It looks particularly at the benefits of using participatory research in conjunction with traditional modelling methods to potentially improve disease research, control and management. Integrated approaches can lead to more realistic mathematical models which in turn can assist with making policy decisions that reduce disease and benefit local people. The emergence, risk, spread and control of diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. These include climate and environmental change, land-use variation, changes in population and people\u2019s behaviour. The evidence base for this scoping review comes from the work of a consortium, with the aim of integrating modelling approaches traditionally used in epidemiological, ecological and development research. A total of five examples of the impacts of participatory research on the choice of model structure are presented. Example 1 focused on using participatory research as a tool to structure a model. Example 2 looks at identifying the most relevant parameters of the system. Example 3 concentrates on identifying the most relevant regime of the system (e.g., temporal stability or otherwise), Example 4 examines the feedbacks from mathematical models to guide participatory research and Example 5 goes beyond the so-far described two-way interplay between participatory and mathematical approaches to look at the integration of multiple methods and frameworks. This scoping review describes examples of best practice in the use of participatory methods, illustrating their potential to overcome disciplinary hurdles and promote multidisciplinary collaboration, with the aim of making models and their predictions more useful for decision-making and policy formulation.

Sixteen MAbs which reacted with all of the 11 strains of feline coronaviruses, also reacted with canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In many of them, the polypeptide specifity was the recognition of transmembrane (E1) protein of the virus. We succeeded in obtaining MAbs which did not react with eight strains FIPV Type I viruses (showing cell-associated growth) but reacted with FIPV Type II (79-1146, KU-1) and/or FECV Type II (79-1683) viruses (showing non-cell associated growth). These MAbs also reacted with CCV or TGEV. These MAbs recognized peplomer (E2) glycoprotein, and many antigenic differences were found in this E2 protein.

We collected their demographics, vital signs, blood gas analysis before and after tracheal intubation, and 7-day outcome after tracheal intubation. Out of 20 patients, 90% were over 60 years old and 15 were with at least one comorbidity. All meet the indication for tracheal intubation announced by treatment expert group. We had successfully intubated all patients using personal protective equipment without circulatory collapse during tracheal intubation. During the observational period, none of 17 anesthesiologists were infected. Although intubation improved SPO(2), reduced PaCO(2) and blood lactate, seven of 20 patients died within 7-days after tracheal intubation. Non-survivors showed significantly lower SPO(2) and higher PaCO(2) and blood lactate compared to survivors. For those who are anticipated to deteriorate severe pneumonia with poor prognosis, earlier respiratory support with tracheal intubation may be advised to improve outcome.

Specific fluorescence signal was detected in Vero cells infected with SeACoV by using a positive sow serum collected in the same farm, but not by using TGEV-, PEDV- or PDCoV-specific antibody. Electron microscopy observation demonstrated that the virus particle with surface projections was 100\u2013120nm in diameter. Complete genomic sequencing and analyses of SeACoV indicated that the extreme amino-terminal domain of the SeACoV spike (S) glycoprotein structurally similar to the domain 0 of the alphacoronavirus NL63, whereas the rest part of S structurally resembles domains B to D of the betacoronavirus. The SeACoV-S domain 0 associated with enteric tropism had an extremely high variability, harboring 75-amino-acid (aa) substitutions and a 2-aa insertion, compared to that of HKU2, which is likely responsible for the extended host range or cross-species transmission. The isolated virus was infectious in pigs when inoculated orally into 3-day-old newborn piglets, leading to clinical signs of diarrhea and fecal virus shedding.

We refer this method as LAMP-Tube scanner, and evaluated using 209 microscopically positive malaria samples and compared them to RDTs and LAMP-Thermocycler. Two most common human infecting Plasmodium species were detected. The LAMP-Tube scanner method is found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. The time to amplification varied but was closely less than 60min. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP-Tube scanner in detecting Plasmodium falciparum were 95% and 93.3%, compared to microscopy and 98.3% and 100% respectively, compared to standard LAMP-Thermocycler. In addition, it showed a detection limit of 10 and 40 copies of the parasitemia for Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum.

This method has the great potential as a field usable molecular tool for the diagnosis of malaria and is an alternative to conventional PCR-based diagnostic methods for field use.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surabattula, Rambabu; Vejandla, Manju Pradeep; Mallepaddi, Prudhvi Chand; Faulstich, Konrad; Polavarapu, Rathnagiri","journal":"Experimental Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fa58c18ee726c80f2677cef1665716babb728a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094605.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014489413001082; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014489413001082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23562879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of LAMP","specificity of LAMP","LAMP-Tube scanner method","standard LAMP-Thermocycler","real-time detection of DNA amplification","malaria diagnosis","diagnosis of malaria","Plasmodium falciparum","isothermal amplification","DNA preparation","Plasmodium vivax","Sensitivity","detection limit","microscopy","simple DNA extraction procedure","positive malaria samples","field use","portable device","common human infecting Plasmodium species","yielded results similar","field usable molecular tool","diagnostic methods","great potential","conventional PCR","alternative","copies","heating block","parasitemia","RDTs","divergence","loop","addition","comparison","platform"],"language":"en"},

Objectives This work presents a new approach to selecting proper health-based thresholds for a heat warning system which are different from thresholds of heat-health relationship. Methods The proposed approach examined heat-health relationships through analyzing 15 years of health records with a modified generalized additive model (GAM), compared risk ratio increments (RRIs) of threshold candidates against a reference, assessed frequency of days above these candidates, and presented results graphically for easy communication. The candidate with the maximum RRI and proper occurring frequency is potentially the best threshold. Three heat indicators, including wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), temperature (T), and apparent temperature (AT), as well as three health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, heat-related hospital admissions, and heat-related emergency visits were evaluated. Results Risk ratios for all three health outcomes showed a consistent rising trend with increasing threshold candidates for all three heat indicators among different age and gender groups. WBGT had the most obvious increasing trend of RRIs with the three health outcomes. The maximum RRI was observed in heat-related emergency visits (242%), followed by heat-related hospital admissions (73%), and all-cause mortality (9%). The RRIs assessed for the three health outcomes pointed to the same thresholds, 33.0 \u00B0C, 34.0 \u00B0C, and 37.5 \u00B0C for WBGT, T, and AT, respectively. The number of days above these thresholds and for warning to be issued ranged between 0 and 7 days during 2000\u20132014. Discussion This study demonstrated a new approach to determining heat-warning thresholds with different heat indicators and health outcomes. The proposed approach provides a straightforward, feasible, and flexible scientific tool that assists the authorities around the world in selecting a proper threshold for a heat warning system.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yu-Ting; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice; Hwang, Jing-Shiang","journal":"Environmental Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b43cd773a6c4e6e4b44de20f5f7ab8e203923d9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126132.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599292/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935118306947; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118306947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBGT","RRI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thresholds of heat","heat-health relationships","heat-related health risk","heat-warning thresholds","evaluation of heat","health outcomes","heat warning system","different heat indicators","heat-related hospital admissions","heat-related emergency visits","proper health-based thresholds","proper threshold","years of health records","increasing threshold candidates","best threshold","new approach","proposed approach","WBGT","frequency of days","proper occurring frequency","different age","obvious increasing trend of RRIs","all-cause mortality","Results Risk ratios","apparent temperature","maximum RRI","number of days","risk ratio increments","wet-bulb globe temperature","consistent rising trend","GAM","modified generalized additive model","critical adaptation strategy","climate change","flexible scientific tool","gender groups","authorities","Abstract Background","reference","empirical data","Discussion","study","Objectives","work","world","Methods","easy communication"],"language":"en"},

Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions. Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes. To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately. Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy. Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease. SUMMARY: In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.

Phosphatidylinositol\u20103\u2010kinase (PI3K) is a recent addition to the growing list of signalling mediators that are activated by these viruses. Several studies have addressed the role of PI3K and the downstream effector protein kinase Akt in influenza A virus\u2010infected cells. PI3K/Akt signalling is activated by diverse mechanisms in a biphasic manner and is required for multiple functions during infection. While the kinase supports activation of the interferon regulatory factor\u20103 during antiviral interferon induction, it also exhibits virus supportive functions. In fact, PI3K not only regulates a very early step during viral entry but also results in suppression of premature apoptosis at later stages of infection. The latter function is dependent on the expression of the viral non\u2010structural protein\u20101 (A/NS1). It has been shown that PI3K activation occurs by direct interaction of A/NS1 with the p85 regulatory subunit and interaction sites of A/NS1 and p85 have now been mapped in detail. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on influenza virus\u2010induced PI3K signalling and how this pathway supports viral propagation.","publish_time":"2009-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehrhardt, Christina; Ludwig, Stephan","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3face504f0138ed902de522d63f53a713a12eae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162392.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01309.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19290913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","induced PI3K signalling","PI3K activation","role of PI3K","virus infection of cells","Akt signalling","virus supportive functions","NS1","supportive signalling pathways","viral non\u2010structural protein","viral entry","viral propagation","downstream effector protein kinase Akt","growing list of signalling mediators","interferon regulatory factor","antiviral interferon induction","p85 regulatory subunit","later stages of infection","interaction sites","direct interaction","infected cells","multiple functions","wide variety of antiviral","suppression of premature apoptosis","expression","diverse mechanisms","recent addition","biphasic manner","current knowledge","early step","studies","Phosphatidylinositol","viruses"],"language":"en"},

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Until 1 April 2020, the number of cases worldwide was recorded to be 823,626 with 40,598 deaths. Most of the reported cases were adults with few cases described in children and neonates. Objectives We performed a systematic review to analyse the disease characterisation in paediatric age group including the possibility of vertical transmission to the neonates. Methods Articles published up to the 2nd April 2020 in PubMed and google Scholar were considered for this study. Findings The most frequently reported symptoms were cough 49% (95% CI: 42 \u2013 55%) and fever 47% (95% CI: 41- 53%). Lymphopenia and increased Procalcitonin were recorded in (21%, 95% CI:12 \u2013 30%) and (28%, 95% CI:18 \u2013 37%) respectively. No sex difference for COVID-19 in paediatric age group (p = 0.7). Case fatality rate was 0%. Four out of 58 neonates (6.8%) born to COVID-19 confirmed mothers tested positive for the disease. Conclusion The disease trajectory in Paediatric patients has good prognosis compared to adults. Intensive care unit and death are rare. Vertical transmission and virus shedding in breast milk are yet to be established.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mustafa, Naira M; A Selim, Laila","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9c54797438170c579941953b13aa0678ab7238a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207144.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104395; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301372?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","neonates","disease trajectory","disease characterisation","reported cases","paediatric age group","Paediatric patients","adults","number of cases","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease","possibility of vertical transmission","reported symptoms","good prognosis","capital of Hubei province","Intensive care unit","Wuhan","systematic review","confirmed mothers","Conclusion","breast milk","China","pandemic","children","sex difference","Scholar","Lymphopenia","increased Procalcitonin","Case fatality rate","Objectives","Findings","SARS-CoV","Methods Articles","PubMed","study","fever","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Their natural inhibitor cystatin C is a secreted protein, suggesting that it functions to control extracellular protease activity. Because cystatins added to cell cultures can inhibit polio, herpes simplex and coronavirus replication, which are intracellular processes, the internalization and intracellular regulation of cysteine proteases by cystatin C should be considered. The extension, mechanism and biological importance of this hypothetical process are unknown. We investigated whether internalization of cystatin C occurs in a set of human cell lines. Demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, A\u2010431, MCF\u20107, MDA\u2010MB\u2010453, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 and Capan\u20101 cells internalized fluorophore\u2010conjugated cystatin C when exposed to physiological concentrations (1 \u03BCm). During cystatin C incubation, intracellular cystatin C increased after 5 min and accumulated for at least 6 h, reaching four to six times the baseline level. Western blotting showed that the internalized inhibitor was not degraded. It was functionally intact and extracts of cells exposed to cystatin C showed a higher capacity to inhibit papain and cathepsin B than control cells (decrease in enzyme activity of 34% and 37%, respectively). The uptake of labelled cystatin C was inhibited by unlabelled inhibitor, suggesting a specific pathway for the internalization. We conclude that the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C is internalized in significant quantities in various cancer cell lines. This is a potentially important physiological phenomenon not previously described for this group of inhibitors.","publish_time":"2008-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ekstr\u00F6m, Ulf; Wallin, Hanna; Lorenzo, Julia; Holmqvist, Bo; Abrahamson, Magnus; Avil\u00E9s, Francesc X.","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca6815946830abd44f0d4f9abac6c0fad15c1e01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163943.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06600.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18699780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intracellular cystatin C","internalization of cystatin C","conjugated cystatin C","cystatin C incubation","natural inhibitor cystatin C","cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C","uptake of labelled cystatin C","internalized inhibitor","intracellular processes","unlabelled inhibitor","control cells","Altered protease activity","extracellular protease activity","intracellular regulation of cysteine proteases","cysteine proteases cathepsin B","extracts of cells","cell cultures","MDA","MB","enzyme activity","various cancer cell lines","set of human cell lines","important physiological phenomenon","physiological concentrations","significant quantities","polio","coronavirus replication","papain","biological importance","herpes simplex","tumour invasion","higher capacity","metastasis","fluorophore","hypothetical process","secreted protein","mechanism","specific pathway","Capan","confocal microscopy","times","flow cytometry","extension","MCF","Western blotting","baseline level","\u03BCm","cystatins","group of inhibitors"],"language":"en"},

It is unique in being the only evolutionary mechanism known to operate on a molecule in an organism\u2019s own body. Deciphering the structural mechanisms through which somatic mutations in antibody genes increase affinity is critical to understanding the evolution of immune repertoires. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed the reconstruction of antibody clonal lineages in response to viral pathogens, such as HIV-1, which was not possible in earlier studies of affinity maturation. Crystal structures of antibodies from these lineages bound to their target antigens have revealed, at the atomic level, how antibodies evolve to penetrate the glycan shield of envelope glycoproteins, and how viruses in turn evolve to escape neutralization. Collectively, structural studies of affinity maturation have shown that increased antibody affinity can arise from any one or any combination of multiple diverse mechanisms, including improved shape complementarity at the interface with antigen, increased buried surface area upon complex formation, additional interfacial polar or hydrophobic interactions, and preorganization or rigidification of the antigen-binding site.","publish_time":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishra, Arjun K.; Mariuzza, Roy A.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8dc7f137a340a631699a817a26b4b4d26136e7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5799246.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29449843/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased antibody affinity","structural studies of affinity maturation","earlier studies of affinity maturation","response","antibody genes","structural mechanisms","reconstruction of antibody clonal lineages","antibodies of higher affinities","antigen-binding site","Crystal structures of antibodies","immune system","evolution of immune repertoires","combination of multiple diverse mechanisms","complex formation","buried surface area","hydrophobic interactions","improved shape complementarity","rigidification","interface","somatic mutations","viral pathogens","preorganization","process","glycan shield of envelope glycoproteins","viruses","molecule","NGS","turn","evolutionary mechanism","target antigens","atomic level","organism\u2019s","generation sequencing","neutralization","HIV"],"language":"en"},

Methods We compare outcomes in two consecutive cohorts of allo-HCT recipients with CARV infections. The retrospective cohort included 63 allo-HCT recipients with 108 CARV infections from January 2013 to April 2016 who were screened and managed following standard clinical practice based on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rapid antigen detection methods. The prospective cohort was comprised of 144 consecutive recipients with 297 CARV episodes included in a prospective interventional clinical surveillance program (ProClinCarvSur-P) based on syndromic multiplex PCR as first-line test from May 2016 to December 2018 at a single transplant center. Results CARV infections in the retrospective cohort showed more severe clinical features at the time of diagnosis compared to the prospective cohort (fever 83% vs. 57%, hospital admission 69% vs. 28% and lower respiratory tract 58% vs. 31%, respectively, p \u2264 0.002 for all comparisons).

The twentieth anniversary of the Treaty offers a unique opportunity to take stock of EU health actions by giving an overview of influential public health related EU-level policy outputs and a summary of policy outputs or actions perceived as an achievement, a failure or a missed opportunity. METHODS: Semi-structured expert interviews (N = 20) were conducted focusing on EU-level actions that were relevant for health. Respondents were asked to name EU policies or actions that they perceived as an achievement, a failure or a missed opportunity. A directed content analysis approach was used to identify expert perceptions on achievements, failures and missed opportunities in the interviews. Additionally, a nominal group technique was applied to identify influential and public health relevant EU-level policy outputs. RESULTS: The ranking of influential policy outputs resulted in top positions of adjudications and legislations, agencies, European Commission (EC) programmes and strategies, official networks, cooperative structures and exchange efforts, the work on health determinants and uptake of scientific knowledge. The assessment of EU health policies as being an achievement, a failure or a missed opportunity was often characterized by diverging respondent views. Recurring topics that emerged were the Directorate General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO), EU agencies, life style factors, internal market provisions as well as the EU Directive on patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare. Among these recurring topics, expert perceptions on the establishment of DG SANCO, EU public health agencies, and successes in tobacco control were dominated by aspects of achievements. The implementation status of the Health in All Policy approach was perceived as a missed opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the emerging themes from the interviews conducted with the responsibilities defined in the EU health mandate, one can identify that these responsibilities were only partly fulfilled or acknowledged by the respondents. In general, the EU is a recognized public health player in Europe which over the past two decades, has begun to develop competencies in supporting, coordinating and supplementing member state health actions. However, the assurance of health protection in other European policies seems to require further development.","publish_time":"2013-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenk\u00F6tter, Nicole; Clemens, Timo; S\u00F8rensen, Kristine; Brand, Helmut","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d2b70166db15be7908f748930e9c56a300e5851.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3833669.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24225055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The European Union","EU","European Commission","EC","DG SANCO"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["EU health mandate","EU public health agencies","stock of EU health actions","EU agencies","health determinants","EU policies","assessment of EU health policies","EU-level actions","EU Directive","public health relevant EU-level policy outputs","assurance of health protection","overview of influential public health related EU-level policy outputs","recognized public health player","missed opportunity","supplementing member state health actions","Policy approach","summary of policy outputs","ranking of influential policy outputs","European policies","unique opportunity","expert perceptions","European Commission","SANCO","European Union","Semi-structured expert interviews","Recurring topics","responsibilities","Respondents","Directorate General","aspects of achievements","Maastricht Treaty","directed content analysis approach","life style factors","strategies","official networks","exchange efforts","cooperative structures","internal market provisions","programmes","patients\u2019 rights","establishment","successes","positions of adjudications","legislations","tobacco control","failures","Consumers","cross-border healthcare","uptake of scientific knowledge","METHODS","decades","emerging themes","opportunities","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","nominal group technique","implementation status","CONCLUSIONS","competencies","anniversary","development","respondent views"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to verify the genetic and antigenic variation of eight field IB strains regarding the 4/91 strain vaccination in Chilean chickens. Phylogenetic, serologic and challenge studies were carried out to accomplish this goal. The genetic analyses indicate that all the viruses isolated prior to the 4/91 introduction belong to the genetic group GI-16 (three isolates from 2009). On the other hand, just one of the viruses isolated after the 4/91 strain vaccine introduction in Chile (in 2015) showed relationship with GI-16 lineage. The remaining four viruses (from 2017) belong to GI-13, the group where the strain 4/91 has been previously classified. Three viruses were chosen to perform antigenic and protective studies. Antigenically, the high relationship between the 4/91 vaccine with the isolate from 2017 is remarkable and could not be observed with isolates from 2009 and 2015. The 4/91 vaccine also showed better protection against the isolate from 2017 than isolates from 2009 and 2015. These results suggest that the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine in Chile could imply a change in some viruses, showing its ability to interact with field viruses, so it is important to monitor the circulating viruses and include these results in future governmental decisions. ABSTRACT: The introduction of the 4/91 vaccine against infectious bronchitis in Chile, a lineage not described until that time in the country, led to looking for changes induced by this action. This study considers eight isolates obtained from 2009, 2015 and 2017 and uses a maximum likelihood approach to classify the field isolates. Three isolates were selected to analyze antigenic relationships through a virus neutralization test and to perform protection tests measured trough an RT-qPCR. The isolates from 2009 and 2015 showed a relationship with GI-16 while those from 2017 were related to GI-13. Though the field isolates were classified in two different phylogenetic lineages, all of them showed only minor variations in subtype. The 13885R-17 isolate from 2017 exhibited high antigenic relatedness to the 4/91 vaccine. As expected, 4/91 and Massachusetts vaccines were not antigenically related. Vaccinated birds with the 4/91 vaccine showed less tracheal virus replication for the 13885R-17 from 2017 challenge than for the 12101SP-09 from 2009 and 13347SP-15 from 2015 isolates. The results indicated genetic and antigenic diversity in the most recent infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates in Chile. Moreover, the 4/91 vaccine would be involved in the generation of some current field viruses, which must be considered in vaccination programs and public policies.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guzm\u00E1n, Miguel; S\u00E1enz, Leonardo; Hidalgo, H\u00E9ctor","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1358b278b691bdd7439d849fa8a002f9f9b8fe95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6770500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491868/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9090656","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB"],"locations":["Chile","Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["field isolates","strain vaccine introduction","current field viruses","circulating viruses","genetic group GI","antigenic diversity","antigenic relationships","antigenic variation","high antigenic relatedness","results","high relationship","recent infectious bronchitis virus","field IB strains","strain vaccination","genetic analyses","recombination abilities of infectious bronchitis virus","virus neutralization test","high adaptation","tracheal virus replication","challenge studies","SP","study","protection tests","better protection","vaccination programs","protective studies","different phylogenetic lineages","IBV","trough","generation","maximum likelihood approach","RT-qPCR","SIMPLE SUMMARY","future governmental decisions","public policies","Chilean chickens","ability","changes","minor variations","subtype","country","Massachusetts vaccines","time","Vaccinated birds","action","ABSTRACT","hand","goal"],"language":"en"},

Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized purified virus revealed a minimum of six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 191,000 (No. 1), 104,000 (No. 2), 60,000 (No. 3), 47,000 (No. 4), 30,000 (No. 5), and 15,000 daltons (No. 6). A seventh band was occasionally found in the 165,000-dalton region of the gels. Four polypeptides contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Polypeptide No. 5 comprised 26% of the total viral protein and glycopolypeptide No. 3 comprised 23%. Three other components accounted for most of the remaining protein: polypeptide No. 4 (16%), glycopolypeptide No. 6 (14%), and glycolipopolypeptide No. 1 (13%). Glycopolypeptide No. 2 was 8% of the total protein. Bromelin digestion of the viral projections (spikes) removed glycopolypeptides No. 2 and No. 6. Association of the remaining polypeptides with structural components of the virion is only tentatively postulated. The buoyant density in potassium tartrate of the bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/cm3. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (s 0 20w) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 \u00B1 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW a ) was calculated to be 112 \u00B1 5 \u00D7 106 daltons.","publish_time":"1972-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hierholzer, J.

These assays are also useful for studying other receptor-activated viral fusion proteins. When one viral glycoprotein and one \u201Csimple\u201D host cell receptor are involved, it should be possible to develop assays directly analogous to those described above for studying Tva-induced binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes. A general prerequisite for a fusion protein/target membrane binding assay is a soluble and correctly oligomeric form of the viral fusion protein ectodomain. The simplest host cell receptors that would be amenable to this type of analysis are type I or type II integral membrane proteins. The soluble versions of the ectodomains of these receptors, produced by genetic engineering or proteolytic release, could then be used to trigger the cognate fusion protein. The methodology could, similarly, be applicable to multimembrane-spanning host cell receptors when the functional part of the receptor is tethered at only one end or where an ectodomain loop preserves enough structure to function as a soluble analog, perhaps by generating a cyclic peptide analog of the loop. The same \u201Creceptor reagents\u201D could be employed for intact virus particle/target membrane binding assays.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Earp, Laurie J; Hernandez, Lorraine D; Delos, Sue E; White, Judith M","journal":"Methods in Enzymology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06ad40ec68d70e38f17fca3306a69bfaed5ed860.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119201.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0076687903720266; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687903720266","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EnvA ectodomain","target membrane binding assays","liposome binding assay","monitoring binding","viral fusion protein ectodomain","target bilayers","binding of intact sarcoma","miniaturized EnvA-PI","Tva-induced binding","ectodomain loop","viral fusion proteins","receptor reagents","membranes","cognate fusion protein","receptor-induced association","virus particles","original assay","simplest host cell receptors","viral glycoprotein","soluble analog","intact virus particle","leukosis virus subtype","ASLV","integral membrane proteins","soluble versions","type of analysis","avian sarcoma","envelope glycoprotein","cyclic peptide analog","oligomeric form","genetic engineering","chapter","multimembrane","structure","general prerequisite","proteolytic release","Publisher Summary","ectodomains","end","liposomes","methodology"],"language":"en"},

To these eight complexes, the structural basis for inhibitor binding was analyzed by the COMBINE method, which is a chemometrical analysis optimized for the protein\u2013ligand complex. The analysis revealed that the first two latent variables gave a cumulative contribution ratio of r(2) = 0.971.

Recently, depletion of macrophages in vivo after vaccination has shown to drastically diminish the protection against FMDV challenge in mouse model. Even the ability of macrophages to reduce or resist FMDV infection is not known hitherto. Therefore, we examined the replication ability of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages and the responsiveness in terms of macrophage polarization and cytokine production. Negative strand specific RT-PCR indicated replication of FMDV RNA in macrophages. Absolute quantitation of FMDV transcripts, immunofluorescence studies and titre of the infectious progeny virus revealed that replication peaked at 12 hpi and significantly declined by 18 hpi indicating non-progressive replication in the infected macrophages. Further, significant up regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 8 \u201312 hpi and increase of M1 specific CD11c \u002B cells by 42.6 % after infection showed that FMDV induce M1 polarization. A significant up regulation of TNF\u03B1 and IL12 transcripts at 8 hpi supported that M1 macrophages were functional. Further, we studied the expression of Type I to III interferons (IFN) and other antiviral molecules. The results indicate a marked up regulation of Type I IFN\u03B1 and \u03B2 by 9.2 and 11.2 fold, respectively at 8 hpi. Of the four IFN stimulated genes (ISG), viperin showed a significant up regulation by 286-fold at 12 hpi in the mice macrophages. In conclusion, the results suggest that replication of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages is non-progressive with up regulation of Type I IFN and ISGs. Further, FMDV induces M1 polarization in murine peritoneal macrophages.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sebastian, Renjith; Sravanthi, M.; Umapathi, V.; Krishnaswamy, N; Priyanka, M.; Dechamma, H.

RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei expressing the major protective antigen VP4 of porcine rotavirus (pPG612.1-VP4) or VP4-LTB (heat-labile toxin B subunit from Echerichia coli) (pPG612.1-VP4-LTB) fusion protein was used to immunize mice orally. The expression of recombinant pPG612.1-VP4 and pPG612.1-VP4-LTB was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis and surface-displayed expression on L. casei was verified by immunofluorescence. Mice orally immunized with recombinant protein-expressing L. casei produced high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA. The IgA titters from mice immunized with pPG612.1-VP4-LTB were higher than titters from pPG612.1-VP4-immunized mice. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on RV infection. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that VP4 administered in the context of an L. casei expression system is an effective method for stimulating mucosal immunity and that LTB served to further stimulate mucosal immunity suggesting that this strategy can be adapted for use in pigs.","publish_time":"2009-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiao, Xinyuan; Li, Guiwei; Wang, Xiangqing; Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Min; Li, Yijing","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/408c98fbba5d5584cc7fda96ec9b307d1cbd73bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2797526.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-9-249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19958557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VP4-LTB","VP4-immunized mice","expression of recombinant pPG612","mucosal IgA","Porcine rotavirus infection","major protective antigen VP4 of porcine rotavirus","induction of mucosal immunity","casei expression system","Lactobacillus casei","RV infection","prevention of infection","IgA titters","recombinant protein","RESULTS","effective method","fusion protein","development of effective vaccines","heat-labile toxin B subunit","high levels of serum immunoglobulin G","Echerichia coli","IgG","surface","SDS-PAGE","significant cause of morbidity","Western blot analysis","swine industry","mortality","neutralizing effects","nature","induced antibodies","protection","context","strategy","BACKGROUND","Immune responses","CONCLUSION","pigs","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines are prophylaxis mainstays but are limited in efficacy due to the difficulty in matching predicted dominant viral strains to circulating strains. As such, other potential interventions are being explored. Since viruses rely on host cellular functions to replicate, recent therapeutic developments focus on targeting host factors involved in virus replication. Besides controlling virus replication, potential targets for drug development include controlling virus-induced host immune responses such as the recently suggested involvement of innate lymphoid cells and NADPH oxidases in influenza virus pathogenesis and immune cell metabolism. In this review, we will discuss the advancements in novel host-based interventions for treating influenza disease.","publish_time":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yip, Tsz-Fung; Selim, Aisha Sami Mohammed; Lian, Ida; Lee, Suki Man-Yan","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cabe6a81b684ef3c7b8febdc093f1aacbe06ced6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6048202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30042762/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01547","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza disease","influenza virus pathogenesis","virus replication","severe influenza","controlling virus-induced host immune responses","drug development","drug classes","targeting host factors","host cellular functions","novel host-based interventions","potential interventions","development of viral resistance","dominant viral strains","potential targets","prophylaxis mainstays","classes of conventional antivirals","immune cell metabolism","major acute respiratory infection","major public health concern","NADPH oxidases","M2 ion channel blockers","recent therapeutic developments","suggested involvement of innate lymphoid cells","neuraminidase inhibitors","hospitalization","mortality","difficulty","matching","death","advancements","efficacy","patients","symptoms","morbidity","viruses","Vaccines","review"],"language":"en"},

They are key sensors for a number of infectious agents, some of which are oncogenic, and they launch an immune response against them, normally promoting their eradication. Inherited variations in genes encoding these receptors and proteins and their signaling pathways may affect their function, possibly modulating cancer risk and features of cancer progression. There are numerous studies investigating the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms within or near genes encoding Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors, cancer risk, and features of cancer progression. However, there is an almost total absence of articles analyzing the correlation between polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors and cancer risk or progression. Nevertheless, there is some evidence supporting the hypothesis that inherited C-type lectin receptor and RIG-I-like receptor variants can be associated with increased cancer risk. Certain C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns of potentially oncogenic infectious agents, and certain polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors may have functional consequences at the molecular level that can lead to association of such single nucleotide polymorphisms with risk or progression of some diseases that may modulate cancer risk, so these gene polymorphisms may affect cancer risk indirectly. Polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors thereby may be correlated with a risk of lung, oral, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and liver cancer, as well as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, glioblastoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma.

While some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane, many viruses are endocytosed prior to fusion. Specific cues in the endosomal microenvironment induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to viral and host membrane fusion. In the present study we investigated the entry of coronaviruses (CoVs). Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes as well as a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV to lysosomes is required for fusion and productive entry to occur. Nevertheless, MHV was shown to be less sensitive to perturbation of endosomal pH than vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus, which fuse in early and late endosomes, respectively. Our results indicate that entry of MHV depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of MHV was severely inhibited by a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, while trafficking of MHV to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases was no longer required when a furin cleavage site was introduced in the S protein immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. Also entry of feline CoV was shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases.

To improve the efficiency of routine screening for Cardioviruses infection, a duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of TMEV and RTV. The duplex assay was specific for reference strains of TMEV and RTV, and no cross-reaction was found with seven other rodent viruses. The limits of detection of both TMEV and RTV were 4\u00D7101 copies RNA/reaction. Reproducibility was estimated using standard dilutions, with coefficients of variation \u003C3.1%. 439 clinical samples were evaluated by both duplex real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR.

Using sensitive sequence profile analysis methods, we characterize a novel superfamily (the SUKH superfamily) that unites a diverse group of proteins including Smi1/Knr4, PGs2, FBXO3, SKIP16, Syd, herpesviral US22, IRS1 and TRS1, and their bacterial homologs. Using contextual analysis we present evidence that the bacterial members of this superfamily are potential immunity proteins for a variety of toxin systems that also include the recently characterized contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems of proteobacteria. By analyzing the toxin proteins encoded in the neighborhood of the SUKH superfamily we predict that they possess domains belonging to diverse nuclease and nucleic acid deaminase families. These include at least eight distinct types of DNases belonging to HNH/EndoVII- and restriction endonuclease-fold, and RNases of the EndoU-like and colicin E3-like cytotoxic RNases-folds. The N-terminal domains of these toxins indicate that they are extruded by several distinct secretory mechanisms such as the two-partner system (shared with the CDI systems) in proteobacteria, ESAT-6/WXG-like ATP-dependent secretory systems in Gram-positive bacteria and the conventional Sec-dependent system in several bacterial lineages. The hedgehog-intein domain might also release a subset of toxic nuclease domains through auto-proteolytic action. Unlike classical colicin-like nuclease toxins, the overwhelming majority of toxin systems with the SUKH superfamily is chromosomally encoded and appears to have diversified through a recombination process combining different C-terminal nuclease domains to N-terminal secretion-related domains. Across the bacterial superkingdom these systems might participate in discriminating \u0060self\u2019 or kin from \u0060non-self\u2019 or non-kin strains. Using structural analysis we demonstrate that the SUKH domain possesses a versatile scaffold that can be used to bind a wide range of protein partners. In eukaryotes it appears to have been recruited as an adaptor to regulate modification of proteins by ubiquitination or polyglutamylation. Similarly, another widespread immunity protein from these toxin systems, namely the suppressor of fused (SuFu) superfamily has been recruited for comparable roles in eukaryotes. In animal DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, iridoviruses and adenoviruses, the ability of the SUKH domain to bind diverse targets has been deployed to counter diverse anti-viral responses by interacting with specific host proteins.","publish_time":"2011-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Dapeng; Iyer, Lakshminarayan M.; Aravind, L.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd286ebc387ae032200bd0b1c1d4f659e278d7b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3113570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21306995/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDI","SUKH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SUKH superfamily","CDI systems","systems of proteobacteria","toxin proteins","diverse nuclease","variety of toxin systems","SUKH domain","nuclease toxins","novel superfamily","N-terminal domains","diverse group of proteins","ATP-dependent secretory systems","overwhelming majority of toxin systems","modification of proteins","different C-terminal nuclease domains","subset of toxic nuclease domains","potential immunity proteins","diverse targets","bacterial members","bacterial superkingdom","bacterial lineages","bacterial homologs","N-terminal secretion-related domains","specific host proteins","non-self","contextual analysis","structural analysis","eukaryotes","conventional Sec-dependent system","diverse anti-viral responses","non-kin strains","widespread immunity protein","distinct secretory mechanisms","hedgehog-intein domain","characterized contact-dependent inhibition","colicin E3","partner system","classical colicin","sensitive sequence profile analysis methods","cytotoxic RNases-folds","distinct types of DNases","wide range of protein partners","Gram-positive bacteria","herpesviruses","Syd","SKIP16","FBXO3","HNH","defense","offense","PGs2","Knr4","Smi1","herpesviral US22","nucleic acid deaminase families","EndoVII","restriction endonuclease-fold","TRS1","IRS1","adenoviruses","present evidence","WXG","auto-proteolytic action","recombination process","addiction of selfish elements","suppressor of fused","poxviruses","iridoviruses","EndoU","ability","discriminating","ESAT","neighborhood","use of nucleases","animal DNA viruses","ubiquitination","polyglutamylation","SuFu","comparable roles","versatile scaffold","adaptor","life forms"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Volunteer human, animal and environmental health professionals from around the world were recruited to EpiCore and trained to provide early verification of health threat alerts in their geographical region via a secure, easy-to-use, online platform. Experts in the area of emerging infectious diseases sent requests for information on unverified health threats to these volunteers, who used local knowledge and expertise to respond to requests. Experts reviewed and summarized the responses and rapidly disseminated important information to the global health community through the existing event-based disease surveillance network, ProMED. FINDINGS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 2068 EpiCore volunteers from 142 countries were trained in methods of informal disease surveillance and use of the EpiCore online platform. These volunteers provided 790 individual responses to 759 requests for information addressing unverified health threats in 112 countries; 361 (45%) responses were considered to be useful. Most responses were received within hours of the requests. The responses led to 194 ProMED posts, of which 99 (51%) supported verification of an outbreak, were published on ProMED and sent to over 87 000 subscribers. CONCLUSION: There is widespread willingness among health professionals around the world to voluntarily assist efforts to verify and provide supporting information on unconfirmed health threats in their region. By linking this member network of health experts through a secure online reporting platform, EpiCore enables faster global outbreak detection and reporting.","publish_time":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorthe, Taryn Silver; Pollack, Marjorie P; Lassmann, Britta; Brownstein, John S; Cohn, Emily; Divi, Nomita; Herrera-Guibert, Dionisio Jose; Olsen, Jennifer; Smolinski, Mark S; Madoff, Lawrence C","journal":"Bull World Health Organ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b9588d67ae1477f9d8534ee88d910be6349a78f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5985427.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.17.207225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EpiCore"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unverified health threats","unconfirmed health threats","requests","EpiCore volunteers","global health community","environmental health professionals","EpiCore online platform","member network of health experts","supporting information","important information","individual responses","early verification of health threat alerts","secure online reporting platform","methods of informal disease surveillance","crowdsourced disease surveillance project","existing event-based disease surveillance network","potential disease outbreaks","world","countries","ProMED posts","faster global outbreak detection","geographical region","animal","area of emerging infectious diseases","Volunteer human","widespread willingness","usefulness","local knowledge","expertise","efforts","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","hours","subscribers","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

This study assessed whether ambulance dispatch data are suitable for influenza surveillance. Study design Comparison of a time series of ambulance dispatch data from Melbourne, Australia for the years 1997\u20132005 with locum service and general practice (GP) sentinel surveillance data for influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods All data were aggregated into 1-week periods, corresponding to the data collection period used in the GP sentinel surveillance system, which was used as the reference system. Rates of ambulance dispatches classified to respiratory or breathing problems per 1000 total dispatches were compared with rates of callouts for flu or influenza per 1000 locum calls, and rates of ILI per 1000 patients from the sentinel GPs. Signals from the ambulance data were generated using the log likelihood ratio CUSUM, a method of continuous monitoring suitable for surveillance. Results The ambulance dispatch data displayed seasonal trends that were similar to those observed in locum service surveillance and GP sentinel systems, and identified the years with higher-than-expected seasonal ILI activity (1998 and 2003) and the epidemic year (1997). However, there was a high baseline rate of ambulance calls classified to respiratory or breathing problems (90\u2013100 per 1000 calls) in months where there was minimal influenza activity. Conclusion Ambulance dispatch data have potential for syndromic surveillance, but because of the high background noise are not definitive and would need to be calibrated to suit particular local circumstances.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coory, M.

In this review, we give an overview of the effects of photoactivated TiO(2) on microorganisms. The activity has been shown to be capable of killing a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous and unicellular fungi, algae, protozoa, mammalian viruses and bacteriophage. Resting stages, particularly bacterial endospores, fungal spores and protozoan cysts, are generally more resistant than the vegetative forms, possibly due to the increased cell wall thickness. The killing mechanism involves degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane due to the production of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. This initially leads to leakage of cellular contents then cell lysis and may be followed by complete mineralisation of the organism. Killing is most efficient when there is close contact between the organisms and the TiO(2) catalyst. The killing activity is enhanced by the presence of other antimicrobial agents such as Cu and Ag.","publish_time":"2011-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foster, Howard A.; Ditta, Iram B.; Varghese, Sajnu; Steele, Alex","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcf4bf26686826b048dd78057ca111c9c39754ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079867.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3213-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21523480/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zhang"],"organizations":["Wat Res","Cu and Ag"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["killing activity","photocatalytic properties of TiO","modelling of TiO","killing mechanism","cell lysis","effects of photoactivated TiO","increased cell wall thickness","applications of photocatalysis","disinfection of surfaces","photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide","production of self-cleaning glass","production of reactive oxygen species","Gram-positive bacteria","unicellular fungi","hydroxyl radicals","algae","bacterial endospores","protozoan cysts","fungal spores","removal of organic contaminants","wide range of Gram-negative","Zhang","Gamage","cytoplasmic membrane","degradation","mammalian viruses","Dalrymple","antimicrobial agents","Chong","leakage of cellular contents","overview","presence","hydrogen peroxide","close contact","Appl Catal B","Cu","bacteriophage","stages","air","water","action","complete mineralisation","vegetative forms","Wat Res","Reviews","microorganisms","catalyst"],"language":"en"},

This and its structural similarity to other 3C and 3C-like proteases make it an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. Previous solution NMR studies have shown that a Cys24Ser (C24S) variant of HAV 3C protein, which displays catalytic properties indistinguishable from the native enzyme, is irreversibly inactivated by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-serine-\u03B2-lactone (1a) through alkylation of the sulfur atom at the active site Cys172. However, crystallization of an enzyme\u2013inhibitor adduct from the reaction mixture followed by X-ray structural analysis shows only covalent modification of the \u03B52-nitrogen of the surface His102 by the \u03B2-lactone with no reaction at Cys172. Re-examination of the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) NMR spectra of the enzyme\u2013inhibitor mixture indicates that dual modes of single covalent modification occur with a \u22653:1 ratio of S-alkylation of Cys172 to N-alkylation of His102. The latter product crystallizes readily, probably due to the interaction between the phenyl ring of the N-benzyloxycarbonyl (N-Cbz) moiety and a hydrophobic pocket of a neighboring protein molecule in the crystal. Furthermore, significant structural changes are observed in the active site of the 3C protease, which lead to the formation of a functional catalytic triad with Asp84 accepting one hydrogen bond from His44. Although the 3C protease modified at Cys172 is catalytically inactive, the singly modified His102 N\u03B52-alkylated protein displays a significant level of enzymatic activity, which can be further modified/inhibited by N-iodoacetyl-valine-phenylalanine-amide (IVF) (in solution and in crystal) or excessive amount of the same \u03B2-lactone inhibitor (in solution). The success of soaking IVF into HAV 3C\u20131a crystals demonstrates the usefulness of this new crystal form in the study of enzyme\u2013inhibitor interactions in the proteolytic active site.","publish_time":"2005-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Jiang; Bergmann, Ernst M.; Cherney, Maia M.; Lall, Manjinder S.; Jain, Rajendra P.; Vederas, John C.; James, Michael N.G.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dc623e0fed100b9e166ece1962fd0fb0b5cbeb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118759.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605011551; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283605011551","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV 3C","IVF","HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C protease","N-alkylation","C proteinase","N-benzyloxycarbonyl","alkylation of Cys172","\u03B2-lactone inhibitor","active site Cys172","inhibitor mixture","N-Cbz","N-iodoacetyl","study of enzyme","inhibitor interactions","native enzyme","proteolytic active site","modified His102 N\u03B52-alkylated protein","reaction mixture","variant of HAV","surface His102","significant structural changes","serine-\u03B2","structural similarity","Previous solution NMR studies","neighboring protein molecule","X-ray structural analysis","new crystal form","NMR spectra","viral polyprotein","viral maturation","dual modes of single covalent modification","catalytic properties indistinguishable","functional catalytic triad","success of soaking IVF","picornain cysteine proteases responsible","significant level of enzymatic activity","HMQC","heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence","Asp84","hydrophobic pocket","function essential","processing","member","amide","Cys24Ser","valine-phenylalanine","moiety","\u03B52-nitrogen","sulfur atom","hydrogen bond","attractive target","Re-examination","infectivity","usefulness","formation","phenyl ring","virus","crystals","C24S","development of antiviral drugs","ratio of S","His44","Hepatitis","crystallization","product"],"language":"en"},

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs \u2013 favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir \u2013 were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS: The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were \u20136.8, \u20135.8, \u20137.9, \u20137.9, \u20137.0, \u20137.7, \u20136.6, \u20138.2, \u20137.4, \u20137.7, and \u20136.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.

We previously demonstrated that microbat IFITM3 is antiviral. Here, we show that bat IFITMs are characterized by strong adaptive evolution and identify a highly variable and functionally important site\u2014codon 70\u2014within the conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs. Mutation of this residue in microbat IFITM3 impairs restriction of representatives of four different virus families that enter cells via endosomes. This mutant shows altered subcellular localization and reduced S-palmitoylation, a phenotype copied by mutation of conserved cysteine residues in microbat IFITM3. Furthermore, we show that microbat IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine residues C71, C72, and C105, mutation of each cysteine individually impairs virus restriction, and a triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant loses all restriction activity, concomitant with subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3 to Golgi-associated sites.

This produced markedly higher estimates of the full value of loss that might occur as the result of a future pandemic. We parametrized an exceedance probability function for a global influenza pandemic and estimated that the expected number of influenza-pandemic-related deaths is about 720 000 per year. We calculated that the expected annual losses from pandemic risk to be about 500 billion United States dollars \u2013 or 0.6% of global income \u2013 per year.

METHODS: We re-analyzed respiratory samples of all episodes with undetermined etiology in order to detect potential viral pathogens missed/not accounted for in routine diagnostics. Respiratory samples were enriched for viruses by filtration and nuclease digestion, whole nucleic acids extracted and randomly amplified before high throughput metagenomic virus sequencing. Viruses were identified by a bioinformatic pipeline and confirmed and quantified using specific real-time PCR. RESULTS: In completion of routine diagnostics, we identified and confirmed a viral etiology of infection by our metagenomic approach in four patients (three Rhinovirus A, one Rhinovirus B infection) despite initial negative results in specific multiplex PCR. Notably, the majority of samples were also positive for Torque teno virus (TTV) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). While TTV viral loads increased with immunosuppression in both throat swabs and blood samples, HHV-7 remained at low levels throughout the observation period and was restricted to the respiratory tract.

We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population in Sierra Leone after over a year of outbreak response. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey in July 2015 to a national sample of 3564 consenting participants selected through multistaged cluster sampling. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4. PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised. Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%). In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis. Factors associated with higher reporting of any symptoms in bivariate analysis included region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat. Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms.

We investigated the bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 7.5% scalp and skin cleanser, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 4% hand cleanser and the reference hand wash (soft soap) in 15 healthy volunteers following European Standard EN1499 (hygienic hand wash test method for bacteria), which was adapted for virucidal testing. METHODS: Separate test series were performed for bactericidal (Escherichia coli) and virucidal [murine norovirus (MNV)] testing. After pre-washing and artificial contamination of hands with test organisms, volunteers underwent testing with 3 and 5 mL of each product for contact times of 15, 30 and 60 s according to a Latin-square randomization. The number of test organisms released from fingertips into sampling fluids was assessed before and after hand washing and mean log(10) reduction factor (RF) was calculated. RFs (test-reference) were compared using a Wilcoxon\u2013Wilcox multiple comparisons test per EN1499; efficacy was concluded if p \u2264 0.01. RESULTS: PVP-I 7.5% and CHG 4% cleansers both passed EN1499 requirements against E. coli, with statistically significantly greater (p \u2264 0.01) mean log(10) RFs compared with reference soft soap across all tests (PVP-I: 4.09\u20135.27; CHG: 4.12\u20135.22; soap: 2.75\u20133.11). The experimental design using EN1499 was applicable to testing with MNV as discriminatory and reproducible results were generated. Mean log(10) RFs of MNV were statistically significantly greater for PVP-I (1.57\u20132.57) compared with soft soap (1.24\u20131.62), while mean log(10) RFs with CHG (0.90\u20131.34) were lower than for soft soap across all tests. CONCLUSION: PVP-I 7.5% cleanser showed superior efficacy against MNV compared to soft soap and CHG 4% cleanser, while both PVP-I and CHG were superior to soft soap against E. coli. The experimental set-up may be applicable to future testing for antiviral hand washes. FUNDING: Mundipharma Manufacturing Pte Ltd.

IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins have been identified as intrinsic antiviral effectors, which block the entry of a broad spectrum of enveloped RNA viruses by interrupting virus-endosomal fusion. However, antiviral activity of IFITM proteins against mammalian DNA virus has not been demonstrated till date. Here, we sought to investigate the antiviral activities and mechanisms of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) protein against poxvirus infection. Analysis of expression kinetics of cell endogenous IFITM3 protein indicated that vaccinia virus (VACV) infection suppressed its translation, which was independent of IRF3 phosphorylation triggered by VACV. Although silencing of endogenous IFITM proteins did not affect their baseline antiviral effects in the cell, it has reduced the IFN-\u03B1-mediated inhibition of VACV infection, and also modulated VACV-induced cell death. Moreover, we discovered that overexpression of IFITM3 significantly restricted VACV infection, replication and proliferation mainly by interfering with virus entry processes prior to the virus nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm. Interestingly, IFITM3 overexpression showed an impact on virus binding. Furthermore, IFITM3 interfered with the cytosolic entry of virus through low pH-dependent fashion. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of exogenously expressed IFITM3 protein restricting infection of an enveloped DNA virus, thus expanding their antiviral spectrum. This study further explores the complex mechanism and provides novel insights into the interaction between virus infection and host defense.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chang; Du, Shouwen; Tian, Mingyao; Wang, Yuhang; Bai, Jieying; Tan, Peng; Liu, Wei; Yin, Ronglan; Wang, Maopeng; Jiang, Ying; Li, Yi; Zhu, Na; Zhu, Yilong; Li, Tiyuan; Wu, Shipin; Jin, Ningyi; He, Fuchu","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b8be7d97df4b06c42eedda3d997677d60100828.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5820317.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29503647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccinia virus","virus binding","virus nucleocapsid entry","cytosolic entry of virus","virus entry processes","enveloped DNA virus","mammalian DNA virus","restricted VACV infection","overexpression of IFITM3","IFITM3 overexpression","antiviral spectrum","virus-endosomal fusion","poxvirus infection","antiviral activities","mediated inhibition of VACV infection","antiviral activity of IFITM proteins","intrinsic antiviral effectors","inducible transmembrane protein","baseline antiviral effects","Analysis of expression kinetics of cell endogenous IFITM3 protein","VACV-induced cell death","antiviral innate immune effectors","IFN-inducible transmembrane","silencing of endogenous IFITM proteins","IFN-\u03B1","dynamic host defense mechanisms","mechanisms of interferon","various IFN-stimulated genes","broad spectrum of enveloped RNA viruses","interaction","proliferation","novel insights","IFNs","low pH-dependent fashion","replication","complex mechanism","translation","impact","independent of IRF3 phosphorylation","Interferons","evidence","cytoplasm","study","findings","date"],"language":"en"},

The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, has been identified as a reservoir for henipaviruses (serological evidence) and Lagos bat virus (LBV; virus isolation and serological evidence) in continental Africa. Here, we sampled from a remote population of E. helvum annobonensis fruit bats on Annob\u00F3n island in the Gulf of Guinea to investigate whether antibodies to these viruses also exist in this isolated subspecies. Henipavirus serological analyses (Luminex multiplexed binding and inhibition assays, virus neutralisation tests and western blots) and lyssavirus serological analyses (LBV: modified Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralisation test, LBV and Mokola virus: lentivirus pseudovirus neutralisation assay) were undertaken on 73 and 70 samples respectively. Given the isolation of fruit bats on Annob\u00F3n and their lack of connectivity with other populations, it was expected that the population size on the island would be too small to allow persistence of viruses that are thought to cause acute and immunising infections. However, the presence of antibodies against henipaviruses was detected using the Luminex binding assay and confirmed using alternative assays. Neutralising antibodies to LBV were detected in one bat using both assays. We demonstrate clear evidence for exposure of multiple individuals to henipaviruses in this remote population of E. helvum annobonensis fruit bats on Annob\u00F3n island. The situation is less clear for LBV. Seroprevalences to henipaviruses and LBV in Annob\u00F3n are notably different to those in E. helvum in continental locations studied using the same sampling techniques and assays. Whilst cross-sectional serological studies in wildlife populations cannot provide details on viral dynamics within populations, valuable information on the presence or absence of viruses may be obtained and utilised for informing future studies.","publish_time":"2012-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peel, Alison J.; Baker, Kate S.; Crameri, Gary; Barr, Jennifer A.; Hayman, David T.

The aim of this study was to investigate differences in cell cycle regulatory mechanisms between these 2 groups. In this prospective study at a tertiary care academic medical center, multiple techniques were used to confirm the upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl\u20102 family proteins in CF polyps. METHODS: Nasal polyps were prospectively obtained from CF and non\u2010CF patients. The Sigma Panorama Protein Microarray for Cell Signaling was used to identify differences in protein expression between the 2 polyp groups. Western blot analysis confirmed altered expression of a subset of these proteins. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on archived tissue to further investigate B\u2010cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl\u20102) expression. Following review by a pathologist, slides were digitized using an Aperio\u2122 ScanScope XT system and staining intensity was quantified with the Positive Pixel Count algorithm. The mean staining intensity for each polyp group was compared. RESULTS: The protein microarray suggested a greater than 2\u2010fold upregulation of Bcl\u2010xl in CF polyps relative to non\u2010CF polyps. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation in CF polyps of Bcl\u20102, a more commonly studied protein analog of Bcl\u2010xl. The CF polyp group was noted to have a higher quantitative intensity of immunohistochemical staining for Bcl\u20102 compared to the non\u2010CF group (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through multiple modalities of protein investigation, we have demonstrated an upregulation of Bcl\u20102 family proteins in CF polyps relative to polyps from non\u2010CF patients.","publish_time":"2012-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scapa, Victor I.; Ramakrishnan, Vijay R.; Kingdom, Todd T.","journal":"Int Forum Allergy Rhinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3d33738d8b5de6b7bad57ea89e4536d05f97e83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135964/; https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.21107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF","Positive Pixel Count"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CF polyps of Bcl","non\u2010CF polyps","CF polyps relative","non\u2010CF patients","non\u2010CF group","CF polyp group","Nasal polyps","protein expression","fold upregulation of Bcl","upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl","studied protein analog of Bcl","mean staining intensity","family proteins","multiple modalities of protein investigation","Sigma Panorama Protein Microarray","polyp groups","higher quantitative intensity of immunohistochemical staining","xl","cell lymphoma","altered expression","Western blot analysis","differences","multiple techniques","cell cycle regulatory mechanisms","prospective study","tertiary care academic medical center","Aperio","ScanScope XT system","cystic fibrosis","archived tissue","subset","Positive Pixel Count algorithm","slides","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","review","pathologist","RESULTS","METHODS","aim"],"language":"en"},

The non-structural protein 3D plays an important role in FMDV replication and pathogenesis. However, the interaction partners of 3D, and the effects of those interactions on FMDV replication, remain incompletely elucidated. In the present study, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a porcine cell protein, DEAD-box RNA helicase 1 (DDX1), which interacted with FMDV 3D. The DDX1-3D interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells. DDX1 was reported to either inhibit or facilitate viral replication and regulate host innate immune responses. However, the roles of DDX1 during FMDV infection remain unclear. Our results revealed that DDX1 inhibited FMDV replication in an ATPase/helicase activity-dependent manner. In addition, DDX1 stimulated IFN-\u03B2 activation in FMDV-infected cells. Together, our results expand the body of knowledge regarding the role of DDX1 in FMDV infection.

The unique roles of CCL28 in several facets of immune responses have attracted considerable attention and may represent a promising approach to combat various infections. CCL28 displays a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi. Here, we will summarize various research findings regarding the antimicrobial activity of CCL28 and the relevant mechanisms behind it. We will explore how the structure of CCL28 is involved with this activity and how this function may have evolved. CCL28 displays strong homing capabilities for B and T cells at several mucosal and epithelial sites, and orchestrates the trafficking and functioning of lymphocytes. The chemotactic and immunomodulatory features of CCL28 through the interactions with its chemokine receptors, CCR10 and CCR3, will also be discussed in detail.

The expression of plant flavonoids is partly regulated by fermentation. Therefore, we studied the effects of fermentation on H. cordata in order to identify the strains present during the fermentation process, and to determine whether fermented H. cordata could be used as a probiotic. Our results showed that all 6 of the bacterial strains isolated from fermented H. cordata (FHC) belonged to the genus Bacillus. As expected, fermenting H cordata also increased the flavonoid content as increases were observed in the levels of rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin. To test the effects of fermentation, we treated LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with non-fermented H. cordata extracts (HCE) or FHC extracts (FHCE). Compared to the HCE-treated cells, the FHCE-treated cells showed increased viability. No cytotoxic effects were detected in the FHCE-treated groups in the 2 cell lines used in the study, namely, RAW264.7 and RBL-2H3. FHCE-treated HepG2 cells showed decreased growth, compared to HCE-treated HepG2 cells. These results indicate that the fermented H. cordata predominantly contained Bacillus strains. Furthermore, FHCE are able to prevent LPS-induced inflammatory effects and inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells.","publish_time":"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Ryun Hee; Ha, Bae Jin","journal":"Toxicol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/285fac85e3bda953636c45b1e600f9e60540938d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3834406.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24278599/; https://doi.org/10.5487/tr.2012.28.2.117","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FHCE-treated cells","FHCE-treated HepG2 cells","cordata extracts","FHCE-treated groups","effects of fermentation","growth of HepG2 cells","Houttuynia cordata Thunb","fermenting H cordata","Bacillus strains","fermentation process","inflammatory effects","cytotoxic effects","FHC extracts","strains present","bacterial strains","results","LPS-stimulated RAW264","decreased growth","increased viability","genus Bacillus","expression of plant flavonoids","major component","flavonoid content","cell lines","order","wide range of pharmacological activities","quercitrin","levels of rutin","increases","study","quercetin","RBL-2H3","probiotic"],"language":"en"},

A citrate gold nanoparticle is first coated with a virus lysate to form a gold nanoparticle pseudo pathogen. The gold nanoparticle pseudo virus is then mixed with a blood plasma or serum samples. If the blood sample is from a positive patient, the activated immune molecules in the blood such as antibodies, complement proteins and others will react with the nanoparticle pseudo virus, leading to nanoparticle aggregate formation. The nanoparticle aggregate formation is detected and measured using a particle sizing technique called dynamic light scattering. In this study, we applied this test for Zika virus infection detection. We tested blood plasma samples from 85 Zika positive patients, 40 Dengue positive patients, 10 Chikungunya positive patients, and 78 non-patient control samples collected from both endemic and non-endemic locations. The study shows that the new test has a higher sensitivity compared to some existing commercial tests in the market, while maintaining a similar specificity. Within 7 days from the symptom onset, the new test can detect 43% of the infected patients while a commercial anti-Zika IgM test detects only 26% of the infected patients. Within 14 days from the symptom onset, our new test detects 73% of the infected patients while the same commercial anti-Zika IgM test detects 53% of the infected patients. The test is extremely simple, easy to develop, with test results obtained within minutes. This new test platform may be potentially adapted for the detection and diagnosis of a wide range of viral infectious diseases, for example, the currently ongoing COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Tianyu; Huoa, Qun","journal":"Sensors International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba16186c074a16aff2521271aee4b7513223bca5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sintl.2020.100010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666351120300103; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666351120300103?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["test results","infected patients","new test platform","new rapid blood test","Zika positive patients","gold nanoparticle pseudo virus","commercial anti-Zika IgM test","Dengue positive patients","Chikungunya positive patients","Zika virus infection detection","blood plasma samples","citrate gold nanoparticle","nanoparticle aggregate formation","gold nanoparticle pseudo pathogen","virus lysate","blood sample","non-patient control samples","diagnosis","serum samples","symptom onset","days","study","existing commercial tests","non-endemic locations","wide range of viral infectious diseases","higher sensitivity","activated immune molecules","example","particle sizing technique","dynamic light scattering","market","antibodies","ongoing COVID","similar specificity","proteins","minutes"],"language":"en"},

BDV is associated with a large spectrum of neuropsychiatric pathologies in animals. Its relationship to human neuropsychiatric illness still remains controversial. We could recently demonstrate that human BDV strain Hu-H1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in a human oligodendroglial cell line (OL cells) whereas laboratory BDV strain V acted contrariwise. Here, differential protein expression between BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells and non-infected OL cells was assessed through a proteomics approach, using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 63 differential host proteins were identified in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cells. We found that most changes referred to alterations related to the pentose phosphate pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glycolysis /gluconeogenesis. By manual querying, two differential proteins were found to be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction. Five key signaling proteins of this pathway (i.e., p-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK1/2, p-RSK, and p-MSK) were selected for Western blotting validation. p-ERK1/2 and p-RSK were found to be significantly up-regulated, and p-MSK was found to be significantly down-regulated in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cell. Although BDV Hu-H1 constitutively activated the ERK\u2013RSK pathway, host cell proliferation and nuclear translocation of activated pERK in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells were impaired. These findings indicate that BDV Hu-H1 infection of human oligodendroglial cells significantly perturbs host energy metabolism, activates the downstream ERK\u2013RSK complex of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, and disturbs host cell proliferation possibly through impaired nuclear translocation of pERK, a finding which warrants further research.","publish_time":"2014-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, X.; Yang, Y.; Zhao, M.; Bode, L.; Zhang, L.; Pan, J.; Lv, L.; Zhan, Y.; Liu, S.; Wang, X.; Huang, R.; Zhou, J.; Xie, P.","journal":"Neuroscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52a89d91ec1861a7a366272f18e7825426bc41f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116963.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452214002152; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637096/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306452214002152","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BDV","Raf/MEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-infected OL cells","human BDV strain Hu-H1","p-RSK","BDV Hu-H1 infection of human oligodendroglial cells","p-Raf","p-MEK","p-ERK1","p-MSK","host cell proliferation","human oligodendroglial cell line","cell nucleus","laboratory BDV strain V","RSK pathway","inhibited cell proliferation","differential host proteins","differential proteins","RSK complex","host energy metabolism","human neuropsychiatric illness","nuclear translocation of activated pERK","impaired nuclear translocation of pERK","downstream ERK","non-cytolytic RNA virus","differential protein expression","mitogen-activated protein kinase","pentose phosphate pathway","dicarboxylate metabolism","Abstract Borna disease virus","large spectrum of neuropsychiatric pathologies","laser desorption ionization-time","apoptosis","MAPK","glyoxylate","cascade","flight tandem mass spectrometry","tricarboxylic acid","cycle","matrix","TCA","astroglial","two-dimensional electrophoresis","signal transduction","hippocampal neurons","proteomics approach","animals","alterations","glycolysis","relationship","manual querying","brain","total","Western blotting validation","findings","gluconeogenesis","key","changes","research"],"language":"en"},

Recently, dashboards have received the spotlight as health information technology to support these tasks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development of a real-time autonomous dashboard for the ED and to evaluate perspectives of clinical staff on its usability. METHODS: We developed a dashboard based on three principles\u2014\u201Canytime, anywhere, at a glance;\u201D \u201Cminimal interruption to workflow;\u201D and \u201Cprotect patient privacy\u201D\u2014and 3 design features\u2014\u201Cgeographical layout,\u201D \u201Cpatient-level alert,\u201D and \u201Creal-time summary data.\u201D Items to evaluate the dashboard were selected based on the throughput factor of the conceptual model of ED crowding. Moreover, ED physicians and nurses were surveyed using the system usability scale (SUS) and situation awareness index as well as a questionnaire we created on the basis of the construct of the Situation Awareness Rating Technique. RESULTS: The first version of the ED dashboard was successfully launched in 2013, and it has undergone 3 major revisions since then because of geographical changes in ED and modifications to improve usability. A total of 52 ED staff members participated in the survey. The average SUS score of the dashboard was 67.6 points, which indicates \u201COK-to-Good\u201D usability. The participants also reported that the dashboard provided efficient \u201Cconcentration support\u201D (4.15 points), \u201Ccomplexity representation\u201D (4.02 points), \u201Cvariability representation\u201D (3.96 points), \u201Cinformation quality\u201D (3.94 points), and \u201Cfamiliarity\u201D (3.94 points).

Between January and March 2017, 68 specimens of 64 patients suspected of an acute respiratory infection were tested with LDT and the ePlex\u00AE RP panel. The time to result was calculated as the time between sample reception and result reporting. Information regarding isolation and antibacterial/antiviral treatment was obtained from the patient records. Thirty specimens tested LDT positive (47%) and 29 ePlex\u00AE RP panel positive (45%). The median time to result was 27.1 h (range 6.5\u201396.6) for LDT versus 3.4 h (range 1.5\u201323.6) for the RP panel, p-value \u003C 0.001. In 14 out of 30 patients, isolation was discontinued based on the ePlex\u00AE RP panel results, saving 21 isolation days. ePlex\u00AE RP panel test results were available approximately one day ahead of the LDT results in the 19 patients receiving antiviral/antibacterial treatment. In addition, two bacterial pathogens, not requested by the physician, were detected using the RP panel. Analysis of respiratory infections with the ePlex\u00AE RP panel resulted in a significant decrease in time to result, enabling a reduction in isolation days in half of the patients.

The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes.

Ribavirin is highly soluble, but its permeability characteristics are not well defined. Therefore according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, and taking a \u201Cworst case\u201D approach, ribavirin should be assigned to class III. As ribavirin is transported across the brush border membrane of the human jejunum by hCNT2, it shows saturable uptake in the intestine. However, no common excipients have been shown to compete for ribavirin absorption, nor have problems with BE of immediate release ribavirin formulations containing different excipients and produced by different manufacturing methods been reported in the open literature. So the risk of bioinequivalence caused by these factors appears to be low. Ribavirin is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug, as judged by comparing the minimum effective concentration and minimum toxic concentrations in blood. Although ribavirin would not be eligible for approval via a Biopharmaceutical Classification System\u2013based biowaiver procedure according to today\u0027s guidances due to its narrow therapeutic index, the risks of biowaiving should be weighed against the considerable risks associated with studying BE of ribavirin products in healthy subjects.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodarzi, Navid; Barazesh Morgani, Ahmadreza; Abrahamsson, Bertil; Cristofoletti, Rodrigo; Groot, D.

This study aimed at identifying etiologies and describing clinical features of SARI-associated hospitalization in Madagascar. METHODS: It is a prospective surveillance of SARI in 2 hospitals for 3 years. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and blood were collected from SARI patients enrolled and tested for viruses and bacteria. Epidemiological and clinical information were obtained from case report forms. RESULTS: Overall, 876 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 83.1% (728/876) were tested positive for at least one pathogen. Viral and bacterial infections occurred in 76.1% (667/876) and 35.8% (314/876) of tested samples, respectively. Among all detected viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common (37.7%; 348/924) followed by influenza virus A (FLUA, 18.4%; 170/924), rhinovirus (RV, 13.5%; 125/924), and adenovirus (ADV, 8.3%; 77/924). Among bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae, 50.3%, 189/370) was the most detected followed by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, 21.4%; 79/370), and Klebsiella (4.6%; 17/370). Other Streptococcus species were found in 8.1% (30/370) of samples. Compared to patients aged less than 5 years, older age groups were significantly less infected with RSV. On the other hand, patients aged more than 64 years (OR = 3.66) were at higher risk to be infected with FLUA, while those aged 15\u201329 years (OR = 3.22) and 30\u201364 years (OR = 2.39) were more likely to be infected with FLUB (influenza virus B). CONCLUSION: The frequency of influenza viruses detected among SARI patients aged 65 years and more highlights the need for health authorities to develop strategies to reduce morbidity amongst at-risk population through vaccine recommendation. Amongst young children, the demonstrated burden of RSV should guide clinicians for a better case management of children. These findings reveal the need to develop point-of-care tests to avoid overuse of antibiotics and to promote vaccine that could reduce drastically the RSV hospitalizations.","publish_time":"2018-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razanajatovo, Norosoa Harline; Guillebaud, Julia; Harimanana, Aina; Rajatonirina, Soatiana; Ratsima, Elisoa Hariniaina; Andrianirina, Zo Zafitsara; Rakotoariniaina, Herv\u00E9; Andriatahina, Todisoa; Orelle, Arnaud; Ratovoson, Rila; Irinantenaina, Judickaelle; Rakotonanahary, Dina Arinalina; Ramparany, Lovasoa; Randrianirina, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique; Richard, Vincent; Heraud, Jean-Michel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e411c54208dfc5d918d46642a7f1694fcc681cf4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6248916.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462659/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["SARI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["years","SARI patients","detected viruses","clinical features of SARI","influenza virus B","RSV hospitalizations","tested samples","prospective surveillance of SARI","frequency of influenza viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","demonstrated burden of RSV","need","Streptococcus pneumoniae","FLUA","study","clinical information","better case management of children","vaccine recommendation","bacterial infections","young children","Streptococcus species","epidemiology of severe acute respiratory infections","case report forms","Haemophilus influenzae type b","morbidity","strategies","clinicians","at-risk population","associated hospitalization","blood","highlights","health authorities","older age groups","care tests","point","overuse of antibiotics","Hib","low income countries","FLUB","etiologies","hospitals","comprehensive data","Nasopharyngeal swabs","sputum","Madagascar","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","METHODS","higher risk","findings","pathogen","rhinovirus","adenovirus","ADV","RESULTS","hand","Klebsiella"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, demands of animal protein consumption are increasing worldwide at an extraordinary rate. In order to meet the protein demand, intensive animal and aquaculture farming are considered. Like livestock farming (poultry, pigs, sheep, livestock, horses, rabbits, etc.), aquaculture farming (fish, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.) is also becoming the globe\u0027s emergent protein production sector. More than 580 aquaculture species are farmed worldwide. Current food animal and aquaculture farming are coupled with standard usage of antimicrobials. The antimicrobial drugs are major solutions for the management of contagious illnesses in food animals and aquaculture. In animal husbandry, antimicrobials are widely utilized for animal therapy, prophylaxis, or as growth promoters. Imprudent usage of these antimicrobials in food animals and aquaculture is a major contributing factor in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The widespread use of veterinary medicines is considered to signify a frightening population health threat. It not only results in the disclosure and escalation of resistant microbes but also causes other individual, animal, and ecological deterioration.

By means of pulse-chase immune precipitation experiments we identify the Gn and Gc precursor molecules and also show that signal peptidase cleavage is required for mature Gn and Gc production. We also demonstrate that a hydrophobic domain at the N-terminus of Gn acts as a signal peptide only in the context of the polyprotein precursors that initiate at the second, fourth or fifth AUGs. In addition, we document that formation of Gn/Gc heteromeric complexes occur rapidly (\u003C5 min) and can occur prior to signal peptidase processing of Gn, suggesting that this complex forms in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Nowadays, clinical therapies of HBV infection still mainly rely on nucleotide analogs and interferons, the usage of which is limited by drug-resistant mutation or side effects. Defensins had been reported to effectively inhibit the proliferation of bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Here, we screened the anti-HBV activity of 25 scorpion-derived peptides most recently characterized by our group. Through evaluating anti-HBV activity and cytotoxicity, we found that BmKDfsin4, a scorpion defensin with antibacterial and Kv1.3-blocking activities, has a comparable high inhibitory rate of both HBeAg and HBsAg in HepG2.2.15 culture medium and low cytotoxicity to HepG2.2.15. Then, our experimental results further showed that BmKDfsin4 can dose-dependently decrease the production of HBV DNA and HBV viral proteins in both culture medium and cell lysate. Interestingly, BmKDfsin4 exerted high serum stability. Together, this study indicates that the scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 also has inhibitory activity against HBV replication along with its antibacterial and potassium ion channel Kv1.3-blocking activities, which shows that BmKDfsin4 is a uniquely multifunctional defensin molecule. Our work also provides a good molecule material which will be used to investigate the link or relationship of its antiviral, antibacterial and ion channel\u2013modulating activities in the future.","publish_time":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Zhengyang; Zhang, Qian; Hong, Wei; Xie, Yingqiu; Liu, Yun; Li, Wenxin; Wu, Yingliang; Cao, Zhijian","journal":"Toxins (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e8773d0887abfa54cb1b618fcdf491e7a0a2c8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4885039.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27128943/; https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins8050124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Defensins"],"organizations":["HBV","HBV DNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV replication","anti-HBV activity","scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4","HBV viral proteins","production of HBV DNA","clinical therapies of HBV infection","inhibitory activity","culture medium","HepG2","modulating activities","multifunctional defensin molecule","potassium ion channel Kv1","scorpion-derived peptides","comparable high inhibitory rate","low cytotoxicity","chronic hepatitis","Hepatitis B virus","high serum stability","good molecule material","HBeAg","HBsAg","primary hepatocellular carcinoma","major worldwide health problem","risk of liver cirrhosis","antiviral","nucleotide analogs","fungi","parasites","usage","HCC","proliferation of bacteria","cell lysate","drug-resistant mutation","effects","viruses","interferons","work","relationship","future","study","link","experimental results","group","Defensins"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, HCV has become a role model to study fundamental principles that govern the replication cycle of a positive strand RNA virus. In fact, for most HCV proteins high-resolution X-ray and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)-based structures have been established and profound insights into their biochemical and biological properties have been gained. One example is p7, a small hydrophobic protein that is dispensable for RNA replication, but crucial for the production and release of infectious HCV particles from infected cells. Owing to its ability to insert into membranes and assemble into homo-oligomeric complexes that function as minimalistic ion channels, HCV p7 is a member of the viroporin family. This review compiles the most recent findings related to the structure and dual pore/ion channel activity of p7 of different HCV genotypes. The alternative conformations and topologies proposed for HCV p7 in its monomeric and oligomeric state are described and discussed in detail. We also summarize the different roles p7 might play in the HCV replication cycle and highlight both the ion channel/pore-like function and the additional roles of p7 unrelated to its channel activity. Finally, we discuss possibilities to utilize viroporin inhibitors for antagonizing p7 ion channel/pore-like activity.","publish_time":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madan, Vanesa; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c07f420a5a01bec7481025a89f2621596a99782.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4576187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258788/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7082826","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance","HCV p7"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV p7","ion channel activity of p7","HCV replication cycle","antagonizing p7 ion channel","different roles p7","different HCV genotypes","HCV proteins high-resolution X-ray","release of infectious HCV particles","additional roles of p7 unrelated","RNA replication","minimalistic ion channels","dual pore","function","positive strand RNA virus","viroporin inhibitors","oligomeric state","viroporin family","homo-oligomeric complexes","high prevalence of hepatitis C virus","Nuclear Magnetic Resonance","NMR","human population","infection","production","based structures","small hydrophobic protein","profound insights","fundamental principles","member","infected cells","intensive research efforts","role model","topologies","biological properties","recent findings","alternative conformations","development of curative antiviral therapy","membranes","possibilities","example","fact","review","ability"],"language":"en"},

This makes imperative the need for the development of safe and potent alternatives to conventional antiviral drugs. In the present scenario, nanoscale materials have emerged as novel antiviral agents for the possibilities offered by their unique chemical and physical properties. Silver nanoparticles have mainly been studied for their antimicrobial potential against bacteria, but have also proven to be active against several types of viruses including human imunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and monkey pox virus. The use of metal nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for novel antiviral therapies. Since metals may attack a broad range of targets in the virus there is a lower possibility to develop resistance as compared to conventional antivirals. The present review focuses on the development of methods for the production of silver nanoparticles and on their use as antiviral therapeutics against pathogenic viruses.","publish_time":"2011-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galdiero, Stefania; Falanga, Annarita; Vitiello, Mariateresa; Cantisani, Marco; Marra, Veronica; Galdiero, Massimiliano","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbd7cb291782d73cc8b480cddd13f2b664f25cdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6264685.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22024958/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16108894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus infections","hepatitis B virus","herpes simplex virus","respiratory syncytial virus","human imunodeficiency virus","monkey pox virus","antiviral therapeutics","novel antiviral therapies","novel antiviral agents","conventional antiviral drugs","use of metal nanoparticles","application of effective antiviral therapies","prolonged use","production of silver nanoparticles","development of safe","types of viruses","development of methods","pathogenic viruses","conventional antivirals","present scenario","present review","interesting opportunity","potent alternatives","significant global health challenges","nanoscale materials","emergence of resistant viral strains","effects","possibilities","unique chemical","fact","resistance","broad range of targets","physical properties","need","lower possibility","antimicrobial potential","bacteria","metals","imperative"],"language":"en"},

While the R298A mutation completely abolished the dimerization, thus resulting in the inactive catalytic machinery, N214A inactivated the enzyme by altering its dynamics without significantly perturbing its structure. Here we studied another mutant with S284-T285-I286 replaced by Ala (STI/A) with a 3.6-fold activity increase and slightly enhanced dimerization. We determined its crystal structure, which still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT), except for slightly tighter packing between two extra-domains. We then conducted 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both STI/A and WT, the longest reported so far for 3CLpro. In the simulations, two STI/A extra domains become further tightly packed, leading to a significant volume reduction of the nano-channel formed by residues from both catalytic and extra domains. The enhanced packing appears to slightly increase the dynamic stability of the N-finger and the first helix residues, which subsequently triggers the redistribution of dynamics over residues directly contacting them. This ultimately enhances the dynamical stability of the residues constituting the catalytic dyad and substrate-binding pockets. Further correlation analysis reveals that a global network of the correlated motions exists in the protease, whose components include all residues identified so far to be critical for the dimerization and catalysis. Most strikingly, the N214A mutation globally decouples this network while the STI/A mutation alters the correlation pattern. Together with previous results, the present study establishes that besides the classic structural allostery, the dynamic allostery also operates in the SARS 3CLpro, which is surprisingly able to relay the perturbations on the extra domain onto the catalytic machinery to manifest opposite catalytic effects. Our results thus imply a promising avenue to design specific inhibitors for 3CL proteases by disrupting their dynamic correlation network.","publish_time":"2014-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Liangzhong; Shi, Jiahai; Mu, Yuguang; Song, Jianxing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/412e5e7d7abb90b1bbd1e91d1c89b937987e376e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4103764.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","STI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["STI","extra domains","catalytic dyad","catalytic effects","dynamic correlation network","helix residues","CLpro","inactive catalytic machinery","extra domain of SARS","dynamic allostery","dynamic stability","enhanced dimerization","N214A mutation","global network","WT","simulations","catalysis","correlation analysis","enhanced packing","redistribution of dynamics","correlation pattern","extra-domains","R298A mutation","dimeric structure","crystal structure","ns molecular dynamics","tighter packing","previous results","dynamical stability","classic structural allostery","fold activity increase","I286","nano-channel","MD","proteases","present study","N-finger","substrate-binding pockets","specific inhibitors","promising avenue","correlated motions","enzyme","significant volume reduction","S284-T285","mutant","Ala","different mechanisms","perturbations","wild-type","components"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the possibility of transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infection was investigated. Ten calves were inoculated intranasally with BVDV Type 1. Each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups. In each group there were four additional calves, resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group. Virulent BCV was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf. Two calves, susceptible to both BVDV and BCV, were kept in a separate group, as controls. All ten calves actively inoculated with BVDV became infected as shown by seroconversions, and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions. However, none of the other eight calves in the two groups (four in each) seroconverted to this agent. In contrast, it proved impossible to prevent the spread of BCV infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus. Following infection, BCV was detected in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and, after three weeks in the study, all had seroconverted to this virus. All calves, including the controls, showed at least one of the following clinical signs during days 3\u201315 after the trial started: fever (\u226540\u00B0C), depressed general condition, diarrhoea, and cough. The study showed that BVDV primarily infected cattle, even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen, are inefficient transmitters of BVDV. This finding supports the principle of the Scandinavian BVDV control programmes that elimination of BVDV infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected (PI) animals, i.e. that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of PI animals is highly unlikely.","publish_time":"2002-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niskanen, R.; Lindberg, A.; Tr\u00E5v\u00E9n, M.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca6dc8048fd742494653294ac1ef4f693735474b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023301906574; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023301906574","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study calves","susceptible calves","additional calves","acute BVDV","BVDV Type","elimination of BVDV infection","infected cattle","inefficient transmitters of BVDV","spread of BCV infection","spread of bovine virus diarrhoea virus","Scandinavian BVDV control programmes","Virulent BCV","experimental groups","presence of PI animals","nasal secretions","separate group","controls","agent","bovine coronavirus","cattle populations","following clinical signs","respiratory pathogen","depressed general condition","days","Abstract Previous reports","principle","long-term circulation","possibility of transmission","cough","faeces","fever","trial","transmitter calf","weeks","seroconversions","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Recently, some EVs have become recognized as significant respiratory pathogens, and a number of new genotypes belonging to species C have been identified. The circulation of these newly identified species C EVs, such as EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, and EV-C117, nevertheless appears to be limited. In this report, we show the results of routine genotyping of all enteroviruses detected in our tertiary care hospital between January 2008 and April 2015. We detected 365 EVs belonging to 40 genotypes. Interestingly, several newly identified species C EVs were detected during the study period. Sequencing of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of these viruses shows divergence in this region, which is a target region in many detection assays.","publish_time":"2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Leer-Buter, Coretta C.; Poelman, Randy; Borger, Renze; Niesters, Hubert G.

Therefore, our aim was to study whether prenatal exposure to PD is related to early infant HPA axis reactivity in the context of a subclinical rhinovirus infection that challenges infants HPA axis postnatally. METHODS: This study included 336 10-week-old infants from the nested case control Focus Cohort of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. The outcome was infant HPA axis reactivity in a stress test. The acute stressor comprised of pediatric examination with venipuncture and nasal swabs for virus assessment. Saliva cortisol samples were collected at 5 time points: baseline, 0, 15, 25 and 35 min after the stressor. HPA axis reactivity was defined by the cumulative post-stressor cortisol concentration. RESULTS: HPA axis reactivity was blunted in the PD/rhinovirus \u002B group compared to the average of control/rhinovirus\u002B, PD/rhinovirus-, and control/rhinovirus- groups (difference: 14.7 ln [nmol/L] \u00D7 min, 95% confidence interval 3.8\u201325.6, p = .008). HPA axis reactivity was significantly blunted only in boys with rhinovirus detected when separately tested for boys and girls (p = .04). CONCLUSION: Our finding of PD-exposed rhinovirus-positive infants having blunted cortisol secretion gives rise to a hypothesis that maternal PD during pregnancy influences infant HPA axis functioning and the functioning of the immune system. Future studies are needed to test whether this suppression of the HPA axis that co-occurs with rhinovirus infection associates with later disease development (e.g., asthma).","publish_time":"2019-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korhonen, Laura S.; Kortesluoma, Susanna; Lukkarinen, Minna; Peltola, Ville; Pesonen, Henri; Pelto, Juho; Tuulari, Jetro J.; Lukkarinen, Heikki; Vuorinen, Tytti; Karlsson, Hasse; Karlsson, Linnea","journal":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e76561353698aad4b0b06c2672dcbc4b44e096c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172058.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306453018310722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146139/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453018310722; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.05.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PD","HPA","Focus Cohort","FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infants HPA axis","infant HPA axis functioning","early infant HPA axis reactivity","rhinovirus- groups","maternal PD","rhinovirus infection associates","subclinical rhinovirus infection","finding of PD","exposed rhinovirus-positive infants","blunted cortisol secretion","week-old infants","infant hypothalamic-pituitary","average of control","Prenatal exposure","fetus","acute stressor","boys","cumulative post-stressor cortisol concentration","FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study","Saliva cortisol samples","nested case control Focus Cohort","immune function","stress test","immune system","maternal psychological distress","later disease development","venipuncture","rise","pregnancy","context","nasal swabs","pediatric examination","hypothesis","difference","programming effects","adrenal","virus assessment","INTRODUCTION","outcome","time points","ln","asthma","RESULTS","baseline","nmol","confidence interval","girls","aim","CONCLUSION","suppression","Future studies","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Hypothesis: HBS is more advantageous than hypertonic saline in the treatment of calves with severe metabolic acidosis. Animals: Twenty\u2010eight dehydrated, inappetent calves with neonatal diarrhea. Methods: In 2 consecutive clinical studies, calves were initially treated with saline (5.85%; 5 mL/kg body weight [BW] over 4 minutes; study I: N = 16) or bicarbonate solution (8.4%; 10 mL/kg BW over 8 minutes; study II: N = 12), respectively, followed by oral administration of 3 L isotonic electrolyte solution 5 minutes after injection. Clinical and laboratory variables were monitored for 72 hours. Results: Treatment failed in 6 calves of study I and in 1 calf of study II as indicated by a deterioration of the general condition. All treatment failures had more severe metabolic acidosis compared with successfully treated calves before treatment. In the latter, rehydration was completed within 18 hours after injection; metabolic acidosis was corrected within 24 hours (study I) and 6 hours (study II) after injection. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Diarrheic calves with slight metabolic acidosis (base excess [BE] \u003E\u221210 mM) can be treated successfully with hypertonic saline. HBS is appropriate in calves without respiratory problems with more severe metabolic acidosis (BE up to \u221220 mM).

Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally \u2A7D 38.5\u00B0C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3\u20137 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease. With the exception of CMV enteric involvement, the stool is characteristically not bloody and white blood cells are not found. Patient management may involve the employment of IV replacement therapy to counter dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Milder cases may be managed with oral rehydration.","publish_time":"1996-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Middleton, Peter J","journal":"Clinical and Diagnostic Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98d1f618da4e5ca7c4e988b152d52621d1e62baf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0928019796002310; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0928019796002310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Taunton virus","Toronto virus","Hawaii virus","Southampton virus","Norwalk virus","infectious enteritis","developed countries viral enteritis","Snow Mountain virus","watery diarrhea","Acute infectious diarrhea","young children","leading cause of morbidity","various viral agents","diagnostic procedures","developing countries","stool","days","immune electron microscopy","various colleagues","columar epithelial cells","white blood cells","exception of CMV enteric involvement","PAGE","latex agglutination","ELISA","distal parts of villi","IEM","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","counter dehydration","replacement therapy","clinical features","employment","TR-FIA","Cytomegalovirus","times","epidemiology","Caliciviridae","mortality","electrolyte imbalance","Abstract Background","polymerase chain reaction","respiratory infections","Pertinent literature","bacterial gut disease","Astrovirus","fluoroimmunoassay","gastroenteritis","Coronavirus","Torovirus","pathogenesis","Rotaviruses","Adenoviruses","members","mini-reovirus","Conclusion","main expression of illness","small intestine","findings of investigations","Study design","PCR","early childhood","Milder cases","oral rehydration","Vomiting","shorter duration","Patient management","Results","Picobirnavirus","Objective","mechanisms","Fever"],"language":"en"},

These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems. A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas). In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations. Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions. For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities. COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types). A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards. Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Our recommendations may assist governments and their advisors to develop risk reduction strategies for natural and cascading hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quigley, Mark C; Attanayake, Januka; King, Andrew; Prideaux, Fabian","journal":"Environment systems \u0026 decisions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427170/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-020-09772-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","China","Australia","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["contemporary COVID","enacting COVID","natural hazard event","natural hazard impacts","natural hazards","comparison of plausible COVID","multi-hazard crises","Inclusion of natural hazard inputs","delineation of multi-hazard scenarios","diverse multi-hazard scenarios","multi-hazard time-series curves","cascading hazards","mitigation strategies","future risks","geophysical hazards","disaster preparedness strategies","concurrent disaster event","contemporary policy","risk mitigation measures","disaster response","risk reduction strategies","economic recovery","exposure risks","governments","regions","interactions","post-peak events","greater infection rate","Contemporary socioeconomic changes","pre-infection rate peak period","counter measures","epidemic trajectories","epidemiological models","future-planning systems approach","epidemiological dynamics","recovery operations","simple epidemic phenomenological model","selected countries","evacuation","sheltering procedures","United States","implementation modalities","resource availability","advance of seasonal increases","communal environments","China","increased demand","restrictions","need","gaps","infrastructural capacity","protocols","humanitarian responses","evidence base","human activity","aggregation of evacuees","Bangladesh","Australia","advisors","resourcing","characteristics of emergency","responding agents","hierarchical decisions","assistance types","epidemiologic conditions","resilience of societies","coronavirus disease","vulnerabilities","example","Texas","recommendations","Earth"],"language":"en"},

However, patients still have to pay a substantial proportion of their annual income for treatment of this disease. This study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis; identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models; and provides policy recommendation for tuberculosis control reform in China. METHODS: There are three tuberculosis management models in China: the tuberculosis dispensary model, specialist model and integrated model. We selected Zhangjiagang (ZJG) and Taixing (TX) as the study sites, which correspond to areas implementing the integrated model and dispensary model, respectively. Patients diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis since January 2010 were recruited as study subjects. A total of 590 patients (316 patients from ZJG and 274 patients from TX) were interviewed with a response rate of 81%. The economic burden attributed to tuberculosis, including direct costs and indirect costs, was estimated and compared between the two study sites. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to compare the cost differences between the two groups. Potential factors related to the total out-of-pocket costs were analyzed based on a step-by-step multivariate linear regression model after the logarithmic transformation of the costs. RESULTS: The average (median, interquartile range) total cost was 18793.33 (9965, 3200-24400) CNY for patients in ZJG, which was significantly higher than for patients in TX (mean: 6598.33, median: 2263, interquartile range: 983\u20136688) (Z = 10.42, P \u003C 0.001). After excluding expenses covered by health insurance, the average out-of-pocket costs were 14304.4 CNY in ZJG and 5639.2 CNY in TX. Based on the multivariable linear regression analysis, factors related to the total out-of-pocket costs were study site, age, number of clinical visits, residence, diagnosis delay, hospitalization, intake of liver protective drugs and use of the second-line drugs. CONCLUSION: Under the current \u201Cfree of diagnosis and treatment\u201D policy, the financial burden remains heavy on tuberculosis patients. Policy makers need to consider appropriate steps to lessen the burden of out-of-pocket costs for tuberculosis patients in China and how best to improve service delivery for poor patients.","publish_time":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Sangsang; Pan, Hongqiu; Zhang, Simin; Peng, Xianzhen; Zheng, Xianzhi; Xu, Guisheng; Wang, Min; Wang, Jianming; Lu, Hui","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9df0801be110f632c616bf9e91cb72d59383b086.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4439067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993411/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZJG"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["tuberculosis patients","poor patients","tuberculosis dispensary model","burden of out-of-pocket costs","total out-of-pocket costs","average out-of-pocket costs","tuberculosis management models","integrated model","China","indirect costs","ZJG","TX","tuberculosis control reform","specialist model","study sites","economic burden","total cost","related factors","CNY","study subjects","free-service policy","policy recommendation","financial burden","Policy makers","step-by-step multivariate linear regression model","treatment","free of diagnosis","median","areas","Potential factors","interquartile range","different management models","diagnosis delay","multivariable linear regression analysis","service delivery","cost differences","line drugs","intake of liver protective drugs","hospitalization","number of clinical visits","residence","logarithmic transformation","annual income","health insurance","appropriate steps","substantial proportion","Taixing","Mann-Whitney U Test","disease","mean","expenses","groups","CONCLUSION","Zhangjiagang","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","response rate"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV has been experimentally confirmed to cause diarrhea in inoculated pigs and need to be differentially diagnosed from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in the field. Rapid diagnosis is critical for the implementation of efficient control strategies against PDCoV. Developing high-quality diagnostic methods and understanding PDCoV infection dynamics to collect appropriate specimens at the appropriate time window are important to obtain reliable diagnostic results. Among the virological methods, PDCoV-specific RT-PCR remains the method of choice for the detection of PDCoV; immunohistochemistry combined with hematoxylin and eosin staining has also been commonly used to examine histopathological lesions caused by PDCoV. Serological assays can provide information about previous exposure to PDCoV and also determine antibody responses to infection or vaccination. Prevalence of PDCoV is lower compared to that of PEDV. However, among PDCoV-positive samples, co-infection with other enteric pathogen e.g. PEDV is common. It is also important to understand molecular epidemiology of PDCoV and genetic relationships of global PDCoVs.

Viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the feces and/or plasma of 36 of 42 cats (86%) tested. Of 5 cats, identified as FCoV shedders during the initial survey, 4 had detectable viral RNA in the feces when tested 111 days later. To determine whether this was due to continuous reinfection or to viral persistence, 2 cats were placed in strict isolation and virus shedding in the feces was monitored every 2\u20134 days. In 1 of the cats, virus shedding continued for up to 7 months. The other animal was sacrificed after 124 days of continuous virus shedding in order to identify the sites of viral replication. Viral mRNA was detected only in the ileum, colon, and rectum. Also in these tissues, FCoV-infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry. These findings provide the first formal evidence that FCoV causes chronic enteric infections. To assess FCoV heterogeneity in the breeding facility and to study viral evolution during chronic infection, FCoV quasispecies sampled from individual cats were characterized by RT-PCR amplification of selected regions of the viral genome followed by sequence analysis. Phylogenetic comparison of nucleotides 7\u2013146 of ORF7b to corresponding sequences obtained for independent European and American isolates indicated that the viruses in the breeding facility form a clade and are likely to have originated from a single founder infection. Comparative consensus sequence analysis of the more variable region formed by residues 79\u2013478 of the S gene revealed that each cat harbored a distinct FCoV quasispecies. Moreover, FCoV appeared to be subject to immune selection during chronic infection. The combined data support a model in which the endemic infection is maintained by chronically infected carriers. Virtually every cat born to the breeding facility becomes infected, indicating that FCoV is spread very efficiently.

Large-scale sequencing of small and long RNAs has previously been used to detect viruses, but without any formal comparison of different strategies. Furthermore, the identification of viral sequences largely depends on similarity searches against reference databases. Here, we developed a sequence-independent strategy based on virus-derived small RNAs produced by the host response, such as the RNA interference pathway. In insects, we compared sequences of small and long RNAs, demonstrating that viral sequences are enriched in the small RNA fraction. We also noted that the small RNA size profile is a unique signature for each virus and can be used to identify novel viral sequences without known relatives in reference databases. Using this strategy, we characterized six novel viruses in the viromes of laboratory fruit flies and wild populations of two insect vectors: mosquitoes and sandflies. We also show that the small RNA profile could be used to infer viral tropism for ovaries among other aspects of virus biology. Additionally, our results suggest that virus detection utilizing small RNAs can also be applied to vertebrates, although not as efficiently as to plants and insects.","publish_time":"2015-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguiar, Eric Roberto Guimar\u00E3es Rocha; Olmo, Roenick Proveti; Paro, Simona; Ferreira, Flavia Viana; de Faria, Isaque Jo\u00E3o da Silva; Todjro, Yaovi Mathias Honore; Lobo, Francisco Pereira; Kroon, Erna Geessien; Meignin, Carine; Gatherer, Derek; Imler, Jean-Luc; Marques, Jo\u00E3o Trindade","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87cb1c3bdd1b8701c07a17f66a17e5d7a55797e5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/52879771bf3fb8b982308b90d70bebd2485ceaf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4513865.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26040701/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequences of small","small RNA profile","virus-derived small RNAs","small RNA fraction","small RNA size profile","novel viral sequences","long RNAs","Large-scale sequencing of small","identification of viral sequences","virus detection","Virus surveillance","viral tropism","aspects of virus biology","novel viruses","vector insects","reference databases","RNA interference pathway","sequence-independent strategy","wild populations","viromes of laboratory fruit flies","insect vectors","unique signature","great benefit","ovaries","similarity searches","host response","relatives","mosquitoes","formal comparison of different strategies","public health","sandflies","results","plants","vertebrates"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, we assessed the utility of a screening tool in predicting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing results in our cohort. METHODS This was an observational study in which all women who were scheduled for a planned delivery within the Mount Sinai Health system from April 4 to April 15, 2020, were contacted and provided with an appointment for themselves as well as their support persons to undergo COVID-19 testing 1 day before their scheduled delivery. Both the patients and the support persons were administered a standardized screen specific for COVID-19 infection by telephone interview. Those support persons who screened positive were not permitted to attend the birth. All patients and screen-negative support persons underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. RESULTS During the study period, 155 patients and 146 support persons underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 15.5% (CI 9.8-21.2%) and 9.6% (CI 4.8-14.4%) among patients and support persons, respectively. The rate of discordance among tested pairs was 7.5%. Among patients with COVID-19 infection, 58% of their support persons also had infection; in patients without infection, fewer than 3.0% of their support persons had infection. CONCLUSION We found that more than 15% of asymptomatic maternity patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite having screened negative with the use of a telephone screening tool. Additionally, 58% of their asymptomatic, screen-negative support persons also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alternatively, testing of the support persons of women who had tested negative for COVID-19 infection had a low yield for positive results.

It can also cause serious mortality in farmed whiteleg shrimp, Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei. However, there is no published information on the economic and/or production impact of the disease in P. vannamei. Shrimp with gross signs of YHV disease (faded body colour and 60\u201370% mortality) were observed in 20 study farms rearing P. vannamei in the central part of Thailand from the end of 2007 through early 2008. The estimated economic loss for these farms according to the Thai Animal Aquaculture Association was approximately US$3 million. Detailed sequence analysis of RT\u2010PCR amplicons from shrimp in all the study ponds revealed the presence of YHV Type 1b (YHV\u20101b) alone (characterized by a 162\u2010bp deletion in the ORF3 region encoding the structural gene for gp116) and the absence of YHV Type 1a (YHV\u20101a), the original YHV type reported from Thailand. Despite the large 162\u2010bp deletion (= 54 deduced amino acids) in the gp116 structural gene, histopathology of YHV\u20101b infections was identical to that of YHV\u20101a infections, and electron microscopy revealed that YHV\u20101b virions were morphologically indistinguishable from those previously reported for YHV\u20101a. In addition, an existing commercial RT\u2010PCR detection kit and an immunochromatographic test strip for the detection of YHV were proven to have been valid tests for both YHV\u20101b and YHV\u20101a. The source of the virus for these outbreaks was unlikely to have been the post\u2010larvae used to stock the ponds, as they were derived from domesticated specific pathogen\u2010free stocks free of YHV.

Type 2 inflammation is known to be associated with an increased risk of exacerbations in general. Whether type 2 inflammation at baseline increases the risk of future virus\u2010induced exacerbations is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether type 2 inflammation is associated with an increased risk of virus\u2010induced exacerbations of asthma. METHODS: Stable asthmatics had spirometry, skin prick test, measurement of FeNO and sputum induced for differential cell counts. Patients were followed up for 18 months, during which they were assessed at the research unit when they had symptoms of an exacerbation. Nasal swabs collected at these assessments underwent viral detection by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 81 asthma patients were recruited, of which 22 (27%) experienced an exacerbation during the follow\u2010up period. Of these, 15 (68%) had a respiratory virus detected at exacerbation. Sputum eosinophils \u003E1% at baseline increased the risk of having a subsequent virus\u2010induced exacerbation (HR 7.6 95% CI: 1.6\u201035.2, P=.010) as did having FeNO \u003E25 ppb (HR 3.4 95% CI: 1.1\u201010.4, P=.033). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Established type 2 inflammation during stable disease is a risk factor for virus\u2010induced exacerbations in a real\u2010life setting. Measures of type 2 inflammation, such as sputum eosinophils and FeNO, could be included in the risk assessment of patients with asthma in future studies.","publish_time":"2017-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bjerregaard, A.; Laing, I.

However, most mAbs-based immunotherapies conducted so far have only considered the blunting of viral propagation and not other possible therapeutic effects independent of virus neutralization, namely the modulation of the endogenous immune response. As induction of long-term antiviral immunity still remains a paramount challenge for treating chronic infections, we have asked here whether neutralizing mAbs can, in addition to blunting viral propagation, exert immunomodulatory effects with protective outcomes. Supporting this idea, we report here that mice infected with the FrCas(E) murine retrovirus on day 8 after birth die of leukemia within 4\u20135 months and mount a non-protective immune response, whereas those rapidly subjected to short immunotherapy with a neutralizing mAb survive healthy and mount a long-lasting protective antiviral immunity with strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Interestingly, the administered mAb mediates lysis of infected cells through an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. In addition, it forms immune complexes (ICs) with infected cells that enhance antiviral CTL responses through Fc\u03B3R-mediated binding to dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, the endogenous antiviral antibodies generated in mAb-treated mice also display the same properties, allowing containment of viral propagation and enhancement of memory cellular responses after disappearance of the administered mAb. Thus, our data demonstrate that neutralizing antiviral mAbs can act as immunomodulatory agents capable of stimulating a protective immunity lasting long after the end of the treatment. They also show an important role of infected-cells/antibody complexes in the induction and the maintenance of protective immunity through enhancement of both primary and memory antiviral T-cell responses. They also indicate that targeting infected cells, and not just viruses, by antibodies can be crucial for elicitation of efficient, long-lasting antiviral T-cell responses. This must be considered when designing antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies.","publish_time":"2010-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michaud, Henri-Alexandre; Gomard, Tiphanie; Gros, Laurent; Thiolon, Kevin; Nasser, Roudaina; Jacquet, Chantal; Hernandez, Javier; Piechaczyk, Marc; Pelegrin, Mireia","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/926d8dc84a667e11dfea30fac3824fd17e175398.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2883599.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20548955/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral mAbs","long-lasting protective antiviral immunity","antiviral CTL responses","endogenous antiviral antibodies","antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies","Antiviral monoclonal antibodies","long-lasting antiviral T-cell responses","memory antiviral T-cell responses","induction of long-term antiviral immunity","cellular immune responses","lysis of infected cells","administered mAb","neutralizing mAbs","maintenance of protective immunity","dendritic cells","protective outcomes","immune complexes","non-protective immune response","enhancement of memory cellular responses","blunting of viral propagation","mAb-treated mice","endogenous immune response","mAbs-based immunotherapies","containment of viral propagation","important role of infected","antibody complexes","immunomodulatory effects","addition","antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity","immunomodulatory agents capable","possible therapeutic effects independent of virus neutralization","Fc\u03B3R-mediated binding","elicitation of efficient","disappearance","paramount challenge","day","murine retrovirus","ADCC","modulation","properties","birth","FrCas","mechanism","DCs","months","viruses","promising therapeutics","short immunotherapy","leukemia","chronic infections","data","treatment","idea"],"language":"en"},

Similarity in conservative-progressive beliefs had a stronger effect on cooperation than similarity in agency, and this effect of similarity in beliefs was stronger for individuals with extreme (progressive or conservative) compared to moderate beliefs.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koch, Alex; Dorrough, Angela; Gl\u00F6ckner, Andreas; Imhoff, Roland","journal":"J Exp Soc Psychol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9abd2c4d8671f03373afc9f31cfd6ffbb3b4a639.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eaf307ae7e79ddc03af5200029f14b92dcc7a9d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180382.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022103119307024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336782/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103119307024?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2020.103996","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["agency-beliefs","conservative-progressive beliefs","self-group similarity","moderate beliefs","effect of similarity","perceived similarity","societal groups","stronger effect","actual cooperation","Self-identified members","shared group membership","incentivized one-time continuous prisoner\u0027s dilemma game","socioeconomic success","model of spontaneous stereotypes","upper class","gays","Muslims","Blacks","communion","individuals","conservatives","women","Democrats","society-representative","ABC","dimensions","Players"],"language":"en"},

Although the potential for MERS\u2010CoV transmission through blood transfusion is not clear, MERS\u2010CoV was recognized as a pathogen of concern for the safety of the blood supply especially after its detection in whole blood, serum, and plasma of infected individuals. Here we investigated the efficacy of amotosalen and ultraviolet A light (UVA) to inactivate MERS\u2010CoV in fresh\u2010frozen plasma (FFP). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Pooled FFP units were spiked with a recent clinical MERS\u2010CoV isolate. Infectious and genomic viral titers were determined in plasma before and after inactivation with amotosalen/UVA treatment by plaque assay and reverse transcription\u2013quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. In addition, residual replicating or live virus after inactivation was examined by passaging in the permissive Vero E6 cells. RESULTS: The mean MERS\u2010CoV infectious titer in pretreatment samples was 4.67 \u00B1 0.25 log plaque\u2010forming units (pfu)/mL, which was reduced to undetectable levels after inactivation with amotosalen/UVA demonstrating a mean log reduction of more than 4.67 \u00B1 0.25 pfu/mL. Furthermore, inoculation of inactivated plasma on Vero E6 cells did not result in any cytopathic effect (CPE) even after 7 days of incubation and three consecutive passages, nor the detection of MERS RNA compared to pretreatment samples which showed complete CPE within 2 to 3 days postinoculation and log viral RNA titer ranging from 9.48 to 10.22 copies/mL in all three passages. CONCLUSION: Our data show that amotosalen/UVA treatment is a potent and effective way to inactivate MERS\u2010CoV infectious particles in FFP to undetectable levels and to minimize the risk of any possible transfusion\u2010related MERS\u2010CoV transmission.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hindawi, Salwa I.; Hashem, Anwar M.; Damanhouri, Ghazi A.; El\u2010Kafrawy, Sherif A.; Tolah, Ahmed M.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Azhar , Esam I.","journal":"Transfusion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b18c73647e79371fe4e8a30606341e08107f06a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169686.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.14422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29239484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FFP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["mean MERS","related MERS","CoV transmission","CoV isolate","CoV infectious titer","detection of MERS RNA","CoV infectious particles","recent clinical MERS","UVA treatment","inactivation","log plaque","blood transfusion","efficacy of amotosalen","frozen plasma","log viral RNA titer","pretreatment samples","Pooled FFP units","inoculation of inactivated plasma","undetectable levels","mean log reduction","plasma of infected individuals","blood supply","pfu","permissive Vero E6 cells","plaque assay","days postinoculation","possible transfusion","days of incubation","complete CPE","consecutive passages","pathogen of concern","genomic viral titers","novel zoonotic pathogen","reverse transcription","Middle East respiratory syndrome","coronavirus","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","effective way","residual replicating","live virus","METHODS","risk","serum","light","STUDY DESIGN","addition","BACKGROUND","safety","data","RESULTS","potential","cytopathic effect","CONCLUSION","copies"],"language":"en"},

The present state-of-the-art tool-based screening was targeted to identify drug targets among clinically approved drugs by uncovering SARS-CoV-2 helicase inhibitors through molecular docking analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Helicase is a vital viral replication enzyme, which unwinds nucleic acids and separates the double-stranded nucleic acids into single-stranded nucleic acids. Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein 3D structure was predicted, validated, and used to screen the druggable targets among clinically approved drugs such as protease inhibitor, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, used to treat HIV infection using molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: Interaction with SARS-CoV-2 helicase, approved drugs, vapreotide (affinity: \u201312.88; S score: \u20139.84 kcal/mol), and atazanavir (affinity: \u201311.28; S score: \u20139.32 kcal/mol), approved drugs for treating AIDS-related diarrhoea and HIV infection, respectively, are observed with significantly low binding affinity and MOE score or binding free energy. The functional binding pockets of the clinically approved drugs on SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein molecule suggest that vapreotide and atazanavir may interrupt the activities of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase.

TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structure-based virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling. RESULTS: Using in-house experimental TLR9 activity data we found that random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms for our dataset for TLR9 activity prediction. Therefore, we developed a cross-validated ensemble classifier of 20 random forest models. The average Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced accuracy of our ensemble classifier in test samples was 0.61 and 80.0%, respectively, with the maximum balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 87.0% and 0.75, respectively. We confirmed common sequence motifs including \u2018CC\u2019, \u2018GG\u2019,\u2018AG\u2019, \u2018CCCG\u2019 and \u2018CGGC\u2019 were overrepresented in mTLR9 agonists. Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity. CONCLUSION: We combined repeated random down-sampling with random forest to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieved promising results. Overall, we showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed other machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, shrinkage discriminant analysis, gradient boosting machine and neural networks. Due to its predictive performance and simplicity, the random forest technique is a useful method for prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khanna, Varun; Li, Lei; Fung, Johnson; Ranganathan, Shoba; Petrovsky, Nikolai","journal":"BMC Mol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af987eff63f3d7ee36dc7631807d9aac7c165d2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6924143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12860-019-0241-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31856726/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG","ODN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["random forest algorithm","random forest technique","random forest models","TLR9 activity prediction","predicting mTLR9 activity","potential TLR9 activity","high activity","mTLR9 agonists","machine learning algorithms","synthetic ODNs","selected ODNs","generated ODNs","in-house experimental TLR9 activity data","prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists","based method","ensemble learning approach","position of motifs","validated dataset","virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs","novel mouse TLR9","gradient boosting machine","maximum balanced accuracy","cross-validated ensemble classifier","promising results","mTLR9 reporter cell assay","common sequence motifs","sampling","average Matthews correlation coefficient","key innate immune receptor","innate immune system","silico screening","useful method","recognition of single","high-throughput","derived features","stranded DNA oligonucleotides","shrinkage discriminant analysis","support vector machines","traditional structure","unmethylated cytosine-guanine","class imbalance problem","simplicity","considerable number of rotatable bonds","radius of gyration","neural networks","infectious diseases","CGGC","distance","count","test samples","predictive performance","moment of Inertia","CCCG","cancer","BACKGROUND","Toll","current study","Predictions","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In response to this crisis, and in an effort to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again, the Canadian blood system has undergone substantial reform. Variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob (vCJD) disease was the first infectious threat faced by the blood system since undergoing reform. The response at the time to this risk provides insights into the Canadian blood system\u0027s new approach to infectious threats. Our analysis of the decision-making concerning vCJD identifies two dominant themes characterizing the new blood system\u0027s approach to safety: (1) the adoption of a precautionary approach to new risks which involves taking action in advance of definitive evidence, and (2) risk aversion amongst policy makers, which has contributed to the adoption of safety measures with comparatively high cost-effectiveness ratios. Overall the principles governing the new blood system have contributed to the system both providing protection against emerging infectious risks and regaining the confidence of the public and recipients. However, the current set of policy factors will likely contribute to increasingly risk-averse policy making that will contribute to continued increases in the cost of the blood system. The challenge the blood system now faces is to find the appropriate balance between maximizing safety and ensuring the system remains affordable.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Kumanan; Graham, Ian; Ricketts, Maura; Dornan, Christopher; Laupacis, Andreas; Hebert, Paul","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad972d22df954f487ff83c054712f94f8f8843b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126723.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953606004345; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953606004345","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new blood system\u0027s approach","Canadian blood system\u0027s new approach","thousands of Canadian blood recipients","new risks","risk-averse policy","infectious threats","emerging infectious risks","precautionary approach","vCJD","adoption of safety measures","risk aversion","policy makers","response","substantial reform","current set of policy factors","country\u0027s largest public health catastrophes","HIV","dominant themes","insights","disease","action","confidence","transfusion transmission of hepatitis C","high cost-effectiveness ratios","Jakob","decision-making","protection","advance of definitive evidence","Variant Creutzfeldt","time","principles","effort","crisis","analysis","appropriate balance","tragedy","challenge"],"language":"en"},

A nanofluidic real-time PCR system was used to develop novel high-throughput methods for qualitative molecular detection (RT-qPCR array) and quantification of human pathogenic viruses by digital RT-PCR (RT-dPCR). The performance of high-throughput PCR methods was investigated for detecting 19 human pathogenic viruses and two main process controls used in food virology. The conventional real-time PCR system was compared to the RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR array. Based on the number of genome copies calculated by spectrophotometry, sensitivity was found to be slightly better with RT-qPCR than with RT-dPCR for 14 viruses by a factor range of from 0.3 to 1.6 log(10). Conversely, sensitivity was better with RT-dPCR than with RT-qPCR for seven viruses by a factor range of from 0.10 to 1.40 log(10). Interestingly, the number of genome copies determined by RT-dPCR was always from 1 to 2 log(10) lower than the expected copy number calculated by RT-qPCR standard curve. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR and RT-qPCR array assays was found to be similar for two viruses, and better with RT-qPCR than with RT-qPCR array for eighteen viruses by a factor range of from 0.7 to 3.0 log(10). Conversely, sensitivity was only 0.30 log(10) better with the RT-qPCR array than with conventional RT-qPCR assays for norovirus GIV detection. Finally, the RT-qPCR array and RT-dPCR assays were successfully used together to screen clinical samples and quantify pathogenic viruses. Additionally, this method made it possible to identify co-infection in clinical samples. In conclusion, given the rapidity and potential for large numbers of viral targets, this nanofluidic RT-qPCR assay should have a major impact on human pathogenic virus surveillance and outbreak investigations and is likely to be of benefit to public health.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coudray-Meunier, Coralie; Fraisse, Audrey; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Delannoy, Sabine; Fach, Patrick; Perelle, Sylvie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10a9a18d6d821b917178be32b20f98c9e21d6028.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4732599.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824897/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-qPCR array assays","RT-dPCR assays","conventional RT-qPCR assays","nanofluidic RT-qPCR assay","quantitative RT-PCR","RT-qPCR standard curve","digital RT-PCR","quantification of human pathogenic viruses","quantitative detection of human enteric viruses","sensitivity","throughput PCR methods","factor","human pathogenic virus surveillance","conventional real-time PCR system","nanofluidic real-time PCR system","number of genome copies","clinical samples","novel high-throughput methods","qualitative molecular detection","norovirus GIV detection","main causes of food","expected copy number","performance of high","food virology","main process controls","major impact","potential","large numbers of viral targets","outbreak investigations","co-infection","rapidity","spectrophotometry","waterborne diseases","benefit","public health","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

In cattle farming, the application of biosecurity measures has been described to a limited degree, yet no data on biosecurity on veal farms is available. A high degree of commingling of veal calves from multiple farms causes frequent disease outbreaks, and thereby high antimicrobial usage and increased risk of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the current implementation of biosecurity on veal farms in Belgium. To this extent, a list of the most important calf diseases (n = 34) was created, and risk factors and related biosecurity measures for these diseases were determined and included in a questionnaire. Herd visits and face-to-face interviews were conducted on 20 randomly selected veal farms, comprising 8.3% of the target population. A categorical principal component and clustering analysis were performed to determine the influence of the veal companies on the farms\u2019 biosecurity level. Awareness of biosecurity was very low among the farmers. All farms used an \u201Call-in, all-out\u201D production system with calves originating from multiple farms without quarantine. On average, farms were filled in 11.4 days (range 2\u201352). The degree of commingling for these farms was 1.24, meaning that, on average, 124 calves originated from 100 farms. Veterinarians wore farm-specific boots on eight farms (40%) and farm-specific clothes on six farms (30%), while technical advisors wore farm-specific boots on six farms (30%) and farm-specific clothes on four farms (20%). Disinfection footbaths were only used in five farms (25%) despite being present in all farms in the sample. Concerning internal biosecurity, none of the farmers isolated sick animals; only one farmer (5%) had a physically separated hospital pen, and only 11 farmers (55%) both cleaned and disinfected the stables after each production cycle. In most farms, animals were of comparable age. Healthy calves generally remained in the same compartment during the entire production cycle, limiting the risks associated with the movement of animals. No influence of the integrations on the biosecurity level could be determined. It can be concluded that a few biosecurity measures, such as \u201C\u2018all-in, all-out\u201D and compartmentation, are implemented relatively well, while other measures, such as good cleaning and disinfection and proper entrance measures for visitors and personnel can easily be improved. The improvement of measures regarding the introduction of animals of different origins will require more fundamental changes in the veal industry.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damiaans, Bert; Renault, V\u00E9ronique; Sarrazin, Steven; Berge, Anna Catharina; Pardon, Bart; Ribbens, Stefaan; Saegerman, Claude; Dewulf, Jeroen","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07ad0ecdf3197ceeb5c2999424e3e379ca8699ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127683.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587719300376; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557684/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587719300376","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Belgium"],"keyphrases":["multiple farms","selected veal farms","related biosecurity measures","application of biosecurity measures","Awareness of biosecurity","internal biosecurity","veal calves","current implementation of biosecurity","farms\u2019 biosecurity level","veal companies","veal industry","improvement of measures","farm-specific boots","farm-specific clothes","farmers","proper entrance measures","Healthy calves","introduction of animals","sick animals","movement of animals","high degree of commingling","production system","entire production cycle","limited degree","influence","average","high antimicrobial usage","increased risk of antimicrobial resistance","risk factors","Disinfection footbaths","important calf diseases","frequent disease outbreaks","veterinary medicine","good cleaning","prevention","different origins","fundamental changes","visitors","risks","data","clustering analysis","categorical principal component","cure","list","personnel","technical advisors","face-to-face interviews","cattle farming","Herd visits","shift","stables","integrations","Veterinarians","comparable age","quarantine","Belgium","separated hospital pen","study","compartmentation","days","despite","target population","range","extent","sample","questionnaire"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to bridge the gap in the literature by developing a novel smartphone PPG quality index (SPQI) that can filter corrupted data. A total of 226 participants joined the study, and results from 1343 samples were used to validate the proposed sinusoidal function-based model. In both the correlation coefficient and Bland\u2013Altman analyses, the agreement between HRV measurements generated by both the smartphone PPG and the reference electrocardiogram improved when data were filtered through the SPQI.

KBDeX is an analysis platform to visualize network structures of discourse based on the bipartite graph of words \u00D7 discourse units. KBDeX can visualize them into three different network structures of: (1) students, (2) discourse units, and (3) selected words.

In contrast to these advancements, the development of human disease models is still in its infancy. Although major advances have recently been made, efforts still need to be intensified. Human disease models have proven valuable for their ability to closely mimic disease patterns in vitro, permitting the study of pathophysiological features and new treatment options. Although animal studies remain the gold standard for preclinical testing, they have major drawbacks such as high cost and ongoing controversy over their predictive value for several human conditions. Moreover, there is growing political and social pressure to develop alternatives to animal models, clearly promoting the search for valid, cost-efficient and easy-to-handle systems lacking interspecies-related differences.

Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. Methods Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not pre-determined but developed through content analysis. Results Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. Conclusion This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and \u03B22-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. Methods Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. Results Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-\u03B2. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2\u20322\u2032-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. Conclusions These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Deng, Xue; Sugawara, Mitsuru; Watanabe, Oshi; Nomura, Kazuhiro; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Momma, Haruki; Ichinose, Masakazu; Kawase, Tetsuaki","journal":"Respir Investig","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b0ccee8385f0a382fccfbf73f2bdc5518d4fcdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102607.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212534520300058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094077/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212534520300058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","HNE","HTE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV","E replication","viral titers","E RNA","drugs","Pretreatment of HNE cells","E receptor CD13","combination of glycopyrronium","infection-induced inflammation","CD13 expression","HTE cells","Results Pretreatment of HNE","formoterol increased cAMP levels","infection-induced production of cytokines","viral RNA levels","receptor expression","fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes","budesonide","CD13 inhibitor","bronchial asthma","human airway","exacerbation of COPD","cytokine production","additive inhibitory effects","Methods Primary human nasal","number","activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","\u03B22-agonists","inhaled corticosteroids","epithelial cell cultures","p65 proteins","endosomal function","Abstract Background Coronavirus","viruses","cytoplasm","susceptibility","muscarinic antagonists","causes","dipyridyl","findings","Conclusions","IFN-\u03B2"],"language":"en"},

No research study has yet tested the usability of personal protective clothing (PPC). Method The study was carried out in 3 stages. PPC available in Hong Kong were sorted by their physical properties in the first stage. The second stage was a single-blinded study examining the different usability aspects of the PPC. The third stage was a simulated viral load test. Results Four types were identified: good water repellency and water resistance, poor air permeability (Type A PPC); good water repellency and air permeability, poor water resistance (Type B PPC); poor water repellency, poor water resistance, and fair air permeability (Type C PPC); and good water repellency, poor air permeability, and fair water resistance (Type D PPC). Type D PPC had a significantly higher number of contamination sites on the subjects\u0027 dorsum and palm. Type C PPC had the highest contamination over the trunk. Findings in the viral load test showed that there was a significant difference in the contamination of the face (t=4.69, df=38, P\u003C.00) between 1 and 2 strokes. Conclusion Type A PPC is effective in providing a desirable protective function against droplet splash, if a disposable PPC is required. Type C PPC, the surgical gown, is also appropriate, as the cost is low, air permeability is fair, and the level of possible hand contamination is lowest among the 4 groups in the current study.","publish_time":"2004-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Thomas K.S; Chung, Joanne W.Y; Li, Y; Chan, Wai F; Ching, Patricia T.Y; Lam, Conita H.S; Chow, Chun B; Seto, Wing H","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a087f807e9d36684bc1bd514ac9263394b65a8c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137615.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655303007983; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655303007983","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPC"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Type C PPC","Type D PPC","Type B PPC","PPC available","disposable PPC","poor water resistance","poor water repellency","fair water resistance","poor air permeability","good water repellency","fair air permeability","highest contamination","current study","research study","single-blinded study","higher number of contamination sites","level of possible hand contamination","usability of personal protective clothing","simulated viral load test","different usability aspects","Abstract Background Optimal usability","care of patients","desirable protective function","health care workers","night","severe acute respiratory syndrome day","protection","droplet splash","surgical gown","subjects\u0027 dorsum","Hong Kong","face","groups","cost","types","physical properties","df","palm","significant difference","Findings","virus","Results","trunk","Conclusion","Method","stages","strokes"],"language":"en"},

The MEK/ERK signaling pathway positively regulates replication of many RNA viruses. However, whether and how this signaling pathway affects hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and production is not well understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we took advantage of two well-characterized MEK/ERK inhibitors and MEK/ERK dominant negative mutants and investigated the roles of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in HCV gene expression and replication. We showed that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling enhanced HCV gene expression, plus- and minus-strand RNA synthesis, and virus production. In addition, we showed that this enhancement was independent of interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) antiviral activity and did not require prior activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, we showed that only MEK and ERK-2 but not ERK-1 was involved in HCV replication, likely through regulation of HCV RNA translation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate a negative regulatory role of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in HCV replication and suggest a potential risk in targeting this signaling pathway to treat and prevent neoplastic transformation of HCV-infected liver cells.","publish_time":"2009-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ndjomou, Jean; Park, In-woo; Liu, Ying; Mayo, Lindsey D.; He, Johnny J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82ec1cd41017fab2d523840ae9fb3f30dbeeab55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2759292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19834602/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007498","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV replication","pathway","ERK inhibitors","inhibition of MEK","well-characterized MEK","ERK dominant negative mutants","neoplastic transformation of HCV","enhanced HCV gene expression","regulation of HCV RNA translation","RNA viruses","virus production","RESULTS","IFN-\u03B1","minus-strand RNA synthesis","negative regulatory role","hepatitis C virus","antiviral activity","roles","potential risk","infected liver cells","independent of interferon","prior activation","multiplication","host cellular machinery","enhancement","advantage","propagation","study","targeting","METHODS","addition","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We wanted to investigate this profile of mixed viral-bacterial infection and to compare it to monomicrobial bacterial or viral CAP. METHODS: We measured baseline serum procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) count in 171 patients with CAP with definite etiology admitted to a tertiary hospital: 59 (34.5%) bacterial, 66 (39.%) viral and 46 (27%) mixed (viral-bacterial). RESULTS: Serum PCT levels were higher in mixed and bacterial CAP compared to viral CAP. CRP levels were higher in mixed CAP compared to the other groups. CRP was independently associated with mixed CAP. CRP levels below 26 mg/dL were indicative of an etiology other than mixed in 83% of cases, but the positive predictive value was 45%.

In the BAU, water was used as the condensing vapor to preserve viability of virus, and supersaturation conditions for condensational growth of particles were achieved by either conductive cooling or mixing with hot, water-saturated air. MS2 bacteriophage (28nm) was used as the test agent, and changes in collection efficiency of an SKC Biosampler with and without the BAU were determined by assaying plaque-forming units (PFUs) in the collection medium. Results showed that the mixing-type BAU (mBAU) was a promising device for improved viral aerosol sampling. The number of viruses (PFU) collected in the Biosampler increased 2\u20133 fold after passing through the mBAU. However, PFU increases in the cooling-type BAU (cBAU) were insignificant. APS results likewise showed that the mBAU was better in growing particles than the cBAU. After growth, number concentrations of particles larger than 327nm in the cBAU and mBAU increased 1.3 and 15.0 fold, respectively. The relatively high molecular diffusivity of water vapor compared to the thermal diffusivity of air and the temperature gradient in the cBAU tube limited particle growth by causing condensation to occur predominantly at the colder wall.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Sewon; Anwar, Diandra; Theodore, Alexandros; Lee, Jin-Hwa; Wu, Chang-Yu; Wander, Joe","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30aab7cf61032a69da35a4b1c979bbb8d067b3c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094383.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850210001357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226123/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850210001357; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2010.06.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mBAU","condensational growth of particles","cooling-type BAU","mixing-type BAU","size of viral particles","growing particles","improved viral aerosol collection","cBAU tube limited particle growth","number concentrations of particles larger","collection efficiency","improved viral aerosol sampling","nm","water-saturated air","collection medium","fold","high molecular diffusivity of water vapor","thermal diffusivity of air","condensing vapor","SKC Biosampler","conductive cooling","number of viruses","APS results","temperature gradient","promising device","supersaturation conditions","viability of virus","PFUs","changes","units","test agent","novel bioaerosol amplification unit","assaying plaque","MS2 bacteriophage","colder wall"],"language":"en"},

A critical appraisal of this literature also reveals ambiguities relating to the scope and necessary structural components underpinning the surveillance process. The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies translate to real or perceived deficiencies in the conceptual framework of population health surveillance. This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations. METHODS: The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors\u0027 system of thinking and was based on a creative process. RESULTS: Population health surveillance includes two broad components: one relating to the human organization (which includes expertise and the administrative program), and one relating to the system per se (which includes elements of design and method) and which can be viewed as a process. The population health surveillance process is made of five sequential interrelated steps: 1) a trigger or need, 2) problem formulation, 3) surveillance planning, 4) surveillance implementation, and 5) information communication and audit. CONCLUSIONS: The population health surveillance theory provides a systematic way of understanding, organizing and evaluating the population health surveillance process.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Allaki, Farouk; Bigras-Poulin, Michel; Michel, Pascal; Ravel, Andr\u00E9","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45398efb94483b10fc0547f0784cf50d6b2c7b9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3521104.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih/e2012007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population health surveillance process","population health surveillance theory","surveillance implementation","surveillance planning","conceptual framework of population health surveillance","animal health","public health","creative process","authors\u0027 system","explicit conceptual system relative","broad components","animal populations","human organization","scientific literature pertinent","necessary structural components","perceived deficiencies","various meanings","systematic way of understanding","inconsistencies","expertise","ambiguities","scope","extensive use","sequential interrelated steps","paper","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","elements of design","information communication","problem formulation","trigger","term","RESULTS","critical appraisal","administrative program","audit","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms. It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve. Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster. Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv. In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses. Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"A., Ghadimi-Moghadam; M., Haghani; J.

In virus-infected cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is generated as an intermediate during viral replication. Cell necrosis (and the release of endogenous dsRNA) is a common event during both sterile and infectious inflammatory processes. The discovery of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as an interferon-inducing dsRNA sensor led to the assumption that TLR3 was the master sentinel against viral infections. This simplistic view has been challenged by the discovery of at least three members of the DExd/H-box helicase cytosolic sensors of dsRNA that share with TLR3 the Toll\u2013interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) -adapter molecule TIR domain-containing adaptor protein interferon-\u03B2 (TRIF) for downstream type I interferon signalling. Data are conflicting on the role of TLR3 in protective immunity against viruses in the mouse model. Varying susceptibility to infection and disease outcomes have been reported in TLR3-immunodeficient mice. Surprisingly, the susceptibility to develop herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis in humans with inborn defects of the TLR3 pathway varies, and TLR3-deficient humans do not show increased susceptibility to other viral infections. Therefore, a current challenge is to understand the protective versus pathogenic contribution of TLR3 in viral infections. We review recent advances in the identification of TLR3-signalling pathways, endogenous and virus-induced negative regulators of the TLR3 cascade, and discuss the protective versus pathogenic role of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perales-Linares, Renzo; Navas-Martin, Sonia","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/397fc8a370ab2dd5ab61cae4febb85aeb6a93a4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3784162.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of TLR3","TLR3 pathway","TLR3 cascade","pathogenic contribution of TLR3","pathogenic role of TLR3","Viral infections","TLR3-deficient humans","TLR3-immunodeficient mice","viral pathogenesis","viral replication","dsRNA sensor","interferon signalling","release of endogenous dsRNA","protective immunity","increased susceptibility","Varying susceptibility","receptor","discovery of Toll","virus-infected cells","herpes simplex virus","adaptor protein interferon-\u03B2","H-box helicase cytosolic sensors of dsRNA","signalling pathways","innate immune response","detrimental host response","chronic inflammatory diseases","infectious inflammatory processes","adapter molecule TIR domain","TRIF","encephalitis","common event","double-stranded RNA","DExd","downstream type","inborn defects","disease outcomes","viruses","assumption","negative regulators","master sentinel","interleukin","mouse model","members","recent advances","Cell necrosis","current challenge","simplistic view","Data"],"language":"en"},

Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy cats can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in cats with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy cats in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCV-suspect/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %/8 %, FHV-1 20 %/9 %, C. felis 8 %/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %/2 %, M. felis 47 %/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect cats (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy cats, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FCV was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multi-cat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to describe the molecular epidemiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infection (ARI)\u2010related respiratory viruses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). METHODS: Both upper and lower respiratory specimens were collected for the analysis from all the patients who visited the Sheikh Khalifa Specialty Hospital (SKSH) with ARI for over 2 years. The multiplex real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) test was used to detect respiratory viruses, which include human adenovirus, influenza virus (FLU) A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus, human enterovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus. RESULTS: A total of 1,362 respiratory samples were collected from 733 (53.8%) male and 629 (46.2%) female patients with ARI who visited the SKSH between November 2015 and February 2018. The rRT\u2010PCR test revealed an overall positivity rate of 37.2% (507/1362). The positive rate increased during winter; it was highest in December and lowest in September. FLU was the most frequently detected virus (273/1362 [20.0%]), followed by human rhinovirus (146/1362 [10.7%]). The FLU positivity rate showed two peaks, which occurred in August and December. The peak\u2010to\u2010low ratio for FLU was 2.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.52\u20103.35). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of FLU in the UAE parallels to that of temperate countries. The trend of the small peak of FLU in the summer suggests a possibility of semi\u2010seasonal pattern in the UAE.","publish_time":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeon, Jae\u2010Hyun; Han, Minje; Chang, Ho\u2010Eun; Park, Sung\u2010Soo; Lee, Jae\u2010Woong; Ahn, Young\u2010Joon; Hong, Duck\u2010Jin","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eeab76150f064779426fa7df69a3ec8921b3952.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166826.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900750/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sheikh Khalifa Specialty Hospital"],"locations":["United Arab Emirates","UAE"],"keyphrases":["human rhinovirus","seasonality of respiratory viruses","human metapneumovirus","human coronavirus","related respiratory viruses","human enterovirus","human adenovirus","human bocavirus","respiratory samples","pattern of FLU","respiratory syncytial virus","FLU positivity rate","lower respiratory specimens","small peak of FLU","seasonality of acute respiratory infection","parainfluenza viruses","rRT","PCR test","UAE parallels","detected virus","SKSH","overall positivity rate","positive rate","female patients","possibility of semi\u2010seasonal pattern","multiplex real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","HRV","summer","United Arab Emirates","Sheikh Khalifa Specialty Hospital","molecular epidemiology","optimal vaccination period","possible outbreaks of variant type","data","winter","temperate countries","total","METHODS","low ratio","trend","analysis","peaks","study","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","OBJECTIVES","years"],"language":"en"},

In Australia there is public health concern relating to bats\u2019 role as reservoirs of Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABLV), which has clinical features identical to classical rabies. Three deaths from ABLV have occurred in Australia. A survey was conducted to determine the frequency of bat exposures amongst adults in Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales; explore reasons for handling bats; examine reported practices upon encountering injured or trapped bats or experiencing bat bites or scratches; and investigate knowledge of bat handling warnings. METHODS: A representative sample of 821 New South Wales adults aged 16 years and older were interviewed during May and June 2011, using a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. Frequencies, proportions and statistical differences in proportion were performed. Using an \u03B1-value of 0.05 and power of 80%, it was calculated that a sample size of 800 was required to provide statistical significance of \u002B/\u2212 5% for dichotomous variables. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-twenty-seven (15.5%) respondents indicated that they had previously handled a bat, being 22% (48/218) rural and 13% (78/597) urban respondents (\u03C7(2) = 9.8, p = 0.0018). Twenty one percent of males (63/304) had handled bats compared with 12% (64/517) of females (\u03C7(2) = 10.2, p = 0.0014). Overall, 42.0% (n = 345) of respondents reported having seen or heard a warning about handling bats. If faced with an injured or trapped bat, 25% (206/821) indicated that they would handle the bat, with 17% (36/206) saying that they would use their bare hands. For minor scratches, 14% (117/821) indicated that they would ignore the injury while four respondents would ignore major scratches or bites. CONCLUSIONS: Previous human-bat interactions were relatively common. Bat exposures most frequently occurred with sick or injured bats, which have the highest risk of ABLV. On encountering an injured or sick bat, potentially high risk practices were commonly reported, particularly among rural males. It is important to understand why people still handle bats despite public health warnings to inform future communication strategies.","publish_time":"2014-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paterson, Beverley J; Butler, Michelle T; Eastwood, Keith; Cashman, Patrick M; Jones, Alison; Durrheim, David N","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66d172659a7156097bd453af7028c06632c231a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3908316.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443960/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-58","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABLV"],"locations":["Australia","New South Wales"],"keyphrases":["sick bat","bat bites","injured bats","handling bats","frequency of bat exposures","trapped bats","knowledge of bat handling warnings","reservoirs of Australian Bat Lyssavirus","Previous human-bat interactions","reported practices","urban respondents","New South Wales adults","public health warnings","highest risk of ABLV","major scratches","minor scratches","rural males","public health concern","high risk practices","known reservoirs","representative sample","statistical differences","sample size","statistical significance","percent of males","bats\u2019 role","Australia\u2019s","populous state","megachiroptera","reasons","insectivorous microbats","microchiroptera","years","clinical features identical","future communication strategies","Flying foxes","telephone interview","classical rabies","proportions","CONCLUSIONS","people","computer","BACKGROUND","Frequencies","range","\u03B1-value","power","METHODS","injury","deaths","pathogenic viruses","dichotomous variables","bare hands","survey","females","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Both SARS Coronavirus which quickly spread to 29 countries in February 2003 and H1N1 swine influenza that recently spread from Mexico to 30 countries in three weeks represent major pandemic threats for mankind. Diagnostic assays are required to detect novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. OBJECTIVE: In this report we evaluate the ability of a multiplex PCR test (xTAG(\u2122)RVP) to detect new, \u201Cnon-seasonal\u201D influenza viruses including the H1N1 swine influenza A/swine/California/04/2009. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory based study using retrospective and prospective specimens. RESULTS: This multiplex PCR test detected the present of non-seasonal (non-H1, non-H3) influenza in 20 of 20 patients infected with H1N1 swine flu virus. In addition to detecting the current swine flu the xTAG(\u2122) RVP test detected the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus that circulated in South East Asia in 2003 as well as 17 out of 17 influenza A viruses representing 11 HA subtypes isolated from birds, swine and horses not yet seen in the human population. CONCLUSION: Based on these results we believe that this molecular test can perform an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza A viruses in patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats.","publish_time":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahony, James B.; Hatchette, Todd; Ojkic, Davor; Drews, Steven J.; Gubbay, Jonathan; Low, Donald E.; Petric, Martin; Tang, Patrick; Chong, Sylvia; Luinstra, Kathy; Petrich, Astrid; Smieja, Marek","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/275030b6878222f9d1c216f7a748879ea943ee06.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2ef21090362ddb392369cb29415a9821d291fc4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5153328.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5153328?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002376; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.05.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19515609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","RVP"],"locations":["Mexico","South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","H1N1 swine influenza","novel non-seasonal influenza","novel influenza strains","RVP test","current swine","detection of future pandemic influenza threats","H1N1 swine flu virus","non-H1","present of non-seasonal","non-H3","sentinel test","high pathogenicity avian influenza virus","molecular test","multiplex PCR test","new respiratory viruses","patients","major pandemic threats","pandemic potential","xTAG","countries","RESULTS","STUDY DESIGN","infected man","weeks","Vietnam","Laboratory","century","important role","HA subtypes","early warning system","turn","birds","mankind","South East Asia","H5N1","ability","Mexico","prospective specimens","horses","illness","California","Diagnostic assays","report","addition","human population","SARS Coronavirus","worldwide epidemics","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Conclusions: There were improvements in aerobic capacity at 36 months in children affected by SARS; however, the measured values remained suboptimal.","publish_time":"2012-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"YU, CLARE C.W.; LI, ALBERT M.; AU, CHUN T.; MCMANUS, ALISON M.; SO, RAYMOND C.H.; LAM, HUGH S.; CHU, WINNIE C.W.; SO, HUNG K.; CHIU, WA K.; LEUNG, CHI W.; YAU, YAT S.; FOK, TAI F.; SUNG, RITA Y.T.","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/283e7fb3b4f309ace6ec90e04474612da55ac1b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192205.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22212464/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02125.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months","patients","measured values","aerobic capacity of children","IQR","maximal aerobic capacity tests","peak VO","ventilatory equivalents","peak oxygen pulse","ventilatory efficiency","years","pulmonary function","SARS","girls","ventilatory anaerobic threshold","significant improvements","acute illness","tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure","normal control subjects","severe acute respiratory syndrome","end","lungs","median age","interquartile range","perfusion","persistent radiological abnormalities","study","objective","aim","Results","Background","Conclusions","boys","reassessment","Methods","investigations"],"language":"en"},

Immunoglobulins, ribavirin, and palivizumab are suggested treatments for both pre-emptive and therapeutic purposes. However, in the absence of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, efficacy is controversial and there is toxicity as well as cost concerns. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of lower respiratory tract RSV infections in adult LTRs. Diagnosis was based on clinical history, combined with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or viral cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. RESULTS: Ten symptomatic patients were identified (7 men and 3 women, age range 28 to 64 years). All were hospitalized for community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Two patients had a concomitant acute Grade A3 graft rejection, and 1 patient had a concomitant bacterial pneumonia. Eight patients did not receive a specific anti-RSV treatment because of clinical stability and/or improvement at the time of RSV diagnosis. Only 2 patients (1 with Grade A3 allograft rejection and 1 requiring mechanical ventilation) received ribavirin and palivizumab. All patients recovered without complications and with no persistent RSV infection. However, bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) staging worsened in 6 patients during the mean follow-up of 45 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mild RSV infections in LTRs might evolve favorably in the absence of specific anti-viral therapy. However, this observation needs confirmation in a large clinical trial specifically investigating the development of BOS in untreated vs treated patients.","publish_time":"2009-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"U\u00E7kay, Ilker; Gasche-Soccal, Paola M.; Kaiser, Laurent; Stern, Richard; Mazza-Stalder, Jesica; Aubert, John-David; van Delden, Christian","journal":"J Heart Lung Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/950ede3ddb8a48e6fc008a4414de3a239f8e0576.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173010.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249809006391; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249809006391; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2009.08.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19837611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","BOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptomatic patients","mild RSV infections","respiratory tract infections","time of RSV diagnosis","specific anti-RSV treatment","persistent RSV infection","reviewed cases of lower respiratory tract RSV infections","clinical stability","adult LTRs","clinical history","palivizumab","ribavirin","absence of specific anti-viral therapy","Grade A3 allograft rejection","concomitant acute Grade A3 graft rejection","Respiratory syncytial virus","large clinical trial","development of BOS","absence of randomized","concomitant bacterial pneumonia","viral cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage","PCR","suggested treatments","mechanical ventilation","placebo-controlled trials","lung transplant recipients","efficacy","BAL","improvement","positive polymerase chain reaction","toxicity","age range","confirmation","staging","untreated vs","BACKGROUND","data","complications","therapeutic purposes","women","specimens","bronchiolitis obliterans","observation","mean follow-up","community","significant morbidity","mortality","cost concerns","months","years","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Immunoglobulins","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The need for randomized controlled trials","doi":"10.1016/j.medj.2020.04.002","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"els-covid","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the biggest public health challenge to the biomedical community of the last century Despite multiple public health measures, 1-3 there remains an urgent need for pharmacologic therapies to treat infected patients and minimize mortality, decrease pressures on intensive care units and health systems and optimally they should decrease subsequent transmission At the time of writing, there are no licensed drugs to treat COVID-19 and a search on clinicaltrials gov using \u2018COVID-19\u2019 as the input term, yielded 657 studies Drug-based interventions currently fall into categories including off label use which includes repurposed drugs, 4,5 and newer entities but both categories should be given in the context of clinical trials In Wuhan, China, then the epicentre of the pandemic, Cao et al under heroic circumstances, conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection including as an entry criteria oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94% or less on air (ChiCTR2000029308) Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily for 14 days, or standard care alone The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first 6 Even though their study showed no benefits with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment beyond standard care, this is exactly the sort of study that best informs our treatment options Following this, we were surprised to see the New England Journal of Medicine publishing a single arm study on 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesevir, again with similar entry criteria of SaO2 \u0026lt;94% on air 7 Unlike the randomised trial by Cao et al , there was no accompanying editorial, but there was a subsequent an open letter discussing remdesevir studies from the CEO and Chairman of Gilead (https://www gilead com/stories/articles/an-open-letter-from-our-chairman-and-ceo) One presumes that the patients in the remdesevir single arm study, and several included in an earlier Lancet paper, 8 were recruited in perhaps easier conditions than those in Wuhan earlier this year Randomised trials are designed to precisely answer questions regarding toxicity and efficacy beyond standard of care and in the absence of an effective therapy it remains entirely reasonable and ethical at this point to perform a trial versus placebo They are much more informative than single arm studies which result in claims, perhaps borne from hope and/or desperation, that drugs work, 9 and such claims include those from physicians stating very high cure rates Clearly, recruiting patients recently diagnosed will have \u2018cure rates\u2019 usually in the high 90s%, unless one focuses on recruiting hospitalised patients and/or the elderly, frail, those with co-morbidities or a high body mass index, to name a few examples A well-known French microbiologist on social media has promoted the use of chloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19 The FDA has approved it, although at the time of writing they haven\u2019t explained the rationale behind the approval, and as a consequence patients, institutions and the worried public have demanded immediate chloroquine for all The resulting rush on chloroquine has led to severe shortages of the drug, and patients taking regular chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for lupus or other systemic diseases had to stop their treatment due to a lack of supply This drug has well known often serious toxicities;10 we note one small study was stopped due to potential cardiac complications (https://www nytimes com/2020/04/12/health/chloroquine-coronavirus-trump html) and we suggest it should only be taken in the context of a randomised or other clinical study This is not to suggest single arm studies are not helpful: they inform subsequent trials includi g dosage, duration and appropriate endpoints For example, we have observed11 that use of baricitinib for 10 days is associated with viral rebound in nasopharyngeal swabs in rapidly recovered and discharged patients, and thus have recommended longer use in the large randomised studies in which it is included, and we suggest again that comparisons between different therapies or placebo are likely to yield more informative results than randomised studies comparing 10 days of intravenous remdesevir with 5 days (https://benevolent ai/news/potential-treatment-for-covid-19-identified-by-benevolentai-usingartificial-intelligence-enters-clinical-testing And https://investor lilly com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-clinical-testingtherapies-covid-19) With this in mind, we thoroughly congratulate the authors from Guangzhou, China, who successfully randomised 86 individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in a 2:2:1 design, to either lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol (a broad spectrum viral infusion inhibitor12) or placebo (NCT04252885) Because they included only mild-to-moderate patients, the pre-defined primary endpoint was the conversion at day 21 of positive-to-negative PCR tests for SARSCoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs The real time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) method used was indeed appropriate as it was performed simultaneously on two target genes, ORF1ab and N genes, and positive and negative controls were used at each batch Negative conversion required 2 separate real time RT-PCR tests separated by 24 hours, and the entry criteria for the definition of mild-to-moderate including the absence of pneumonia are entirely appropriate Baseline criteria between the 3 groups were well-matched (a criticism of one of the hydroxychloroquine randomised studies is this was not the case13) and follow up was appropriate Their data helpfully shows there was no difference between any of the groups in the primary endpoint In the continuing search for safe and effective new therapies to treat patients with COVID-19, we require well-conducted ethical studies including prospective, randomised, placebocontrolled clinical studies such as this Although many drugs have predicted in vitro activity against the virus, the proposal that such drugs might provide more benefit than harm is not appropriate with no evidence base supporting efficacy in any patients infected with SARSCoV-2 A preprint reporting results from a randomised trial of the anti-viral favipravir versus arbidol in 240 adults has shown no difference in clinical recovery at 7 days, but cough and pyrexia were improved on favipravir 14 These authors and Li et al should be applauded for their efforts to add a useful randomised trial to the literature, albeit one that is negative It is critical to publish such studies International multicentre trials, such as Discovery (NCT04315948) and Solidarity (EudraCT Number 2020-000982-18), will randomise patients with COVID-19 to receive different drugs in adaptive study designs Such initiatives will provide the best and most relevant data to guide management of patients with COVID-19 Whether antiviral, immunomodulatory or antimalarial drugs could be effective in changing the disease course in patients with either mild or severe COVID-19 remains unknown When patients take these off-label and recover it is not known whether the drug was helpful in the disease course without randomisation Similarly, when patients deteriorate, we do not know if they should be continued or considered clinically ineffective and stopped Assessing viral loads by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs as performed in the trial here, will help clarify the roles of these medicines going forwards","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ottaviani, Silvia; Stebbing, Justin","journal":"Cell

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Feng; Wang, Jun; Shi, Jun; Wu, Ziyan; Wang, Qian; Tang, Zhenyu; He, Kelei; Shi, Yinghuan; Shen, Dinggang","journal":"IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e95ce827049a350819c5c87caf992f27f9ff792.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2020.2987975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305937/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02731v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","community of medical imaging","imaging tools","imaging technicians","latest progress of medical imaging","entire pipeline of medical imaging","X-ray","medical specialists","integration of AI","AI-empowered image acquisition","review paper","CT images","disease diagnosis","invited paper","pandemic of coronavirus disease","accurate delination of infections","clinical decisions","analysis techniques","workflow","patients","radiologists","IEEE Reviews","technologies","work efficiency","essential role","computed tomography","radiology","Biomedical Engineering","best protection","computer-aided platforms","order","emerging artificial intelligence","global fight","segmentation","example","minimal contact","subsequent quantification","rapid responses","tracking","prognosis","scanning procedure","frontline hospitals","follow-up","world"],"language":"en"},

Based on sequence analysis of the 3\u2032-7kb region, the CK/CH/LHLJ/04V virus population contained subpopulations with a mixture of genetic mutants. The titers of the virus increased gradually during serial passage, but the replication capacity decreased in chickens. The virus was partially attenuated at passage 40 (P40) and P70, and was fully attenuated at P110. It lost immunogenicity and kidney tropism at P110 and P70, respectively. Amino acid substitutions were found in the 3\u2032-7kb region, primarily in the spike (S) protein. Substitutions in the S1 subunit occurred between P3 and P40 and all subpopulations in a virus passage showed the same substitutions. Other substitutions that occurred between P70 and P110, however, were found only in some subpopulations of the virus passages. A 109-bp deletion in the 3\u2032-UTR was observed in most subpopulations of P70 and P110, and might be related to virus replication, transcription and pathogenicity. The changes described in the 3\u2032-7kb region of the virus are possibly responsible for virus attenuation, immunogenicity decrease and tissue tropism changes; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other parts of the genome may also be involved in those changes.","publish_time":"2009-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shengwang; Zhang, Xiaonan; Gong, Liyang; Yan, Baolong; Li, Chengren; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Kong, Xiangang","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ffe35e7893ff474f2c5dd1e69f9dcea077f2873.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115700.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X0900807X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523910/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X0900807X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","virus attenuation","virus population","virus passages","subpopulations of P70","P110","serial passage","region","Chinese LX4-type nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus","immunogenicity","LHLJ","P40","tissue tropism changes","Amino acid substitutions","kidney tropism","replication capacity","IBV","strain","S1 subunit","P3","embryonated chicken eggs","mixture of genetic mutants","study","spike","transcription","pathogenicity","possibility","parts","genome","protein","chickens","UTR","bp deletion","sequence analysis","Abstract","titers"],"language":"en"},

At least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and the emerging HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). The small intestines, particularly the jejunum and ileum, are the most common targets of these four CoVs in vivo, and co-infections by these CoVs are frequently observed in clinically infected pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the susceptibility of the porcine ileum epithelial cell line, IPI-2I, to different swine enteric CoVs. We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, and PEAV, as demonstrated by cytopathic effect and virus multiplication. However, only a small number of cells could be infected by PEDV, possibly due to the heterogeneity of IPI-2I cells. A homogeneous cell line, designated IPI-FX, obtained from IPI-2I cells by sub-cloning with limited serial dilutions, was found to be highly susceptible to PEDV. Furthermore, IPI-FX cells were also highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, as well as PEAV. Thus, this sub-cloned IPI-FX cell line is an ideal cell model to study the mechanisms of infection, particularly co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xunlei; Fang, Liurong; Liu, Shudan; Ke, Wenting; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6217c77be15bba46ecbc3568159ff0dabf484043.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117161.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176408/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519301555; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.04.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519301555","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEAV","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPI-FX cells","heterogeneity of IPI","different swine enteric CoVs","kinds of swine enteric CoVs","designated IPI-FX","co-infections of swine enteric CoVs","sub-cloned IPI-FX cell line","porcine enteric alphacoronavirus","TGEV","PDCoV","PEDV","PEAV","porcine ileum epithelial cell line","Abstract Swine enteric coronavirus","homogeneous cell line","small number of cells","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine deltacoronavirus","ideal cell model","virus multiplication","study","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","sub-cloning","small intestines","infected pigs","mechanisms of infection","emerging HKU2","susceptibility","important group of pathogens","limited serial dilutions","cytopathic effect","piglets","jejunum","common targets"],"language":"en"},

Summary Feline panleukopenia is caused by a small parvovirus (FPV) which is very stable and able to survive for one year at room temperature in organic material on solid fomites. Virtually all susceptible cats are exposed and infected within the first year of life. The acute form is common, with hyperthermia, depression and anorexia occurring within three to four days before presentation. In most cases, mortality caused by FPV infection can be avoided with appropriate symptomatic therapy and nursing care. However, severe clinical illness associated with bacteraemia is often the rule in young unvaccinated cats and frequently fatal. If a symptomatic therapy is not enough efficient, then it must be quickly associated with antiviral treatment. The feline recombinant interferon omega was used successfully, according to a published protocol design, the status of the cat being monitored before, during and after treatment.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sim\u00E9on, L.-A.; Mercier, P.; Mazi\u00E8re, P.; Bongrain, G.","journal":"Pratique M\u00E9dicale et Chirurgicale de l\u0027Animal de Compagnie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb08e7e07280159602b2ec28167d7562139ed10c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0758188209000776; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0758188209000776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Virtually"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the status","symptomatic therapy is","The acute form is common","with hyperthermia","traitement symptomatique","infected within the first year","which is very stable","the cat being monitored before","Summary Feline panleukopenia is caused","severe clinical illness associated with bacteraemia is often the rule in young unvaccinated cats","according to","FPV infection can be avoided with appropriate symptomatic therapy","able to","petit parvovirus FPV","maladie","forme aigu\u00EB","traitement mis","The feline recombinant interferon omega was used successfully","then it must be quickly associated with antiviral treatment","In most cases","mortality caused","temperature in organic material","infection virale","susceptible cats","year at","small parvovirus","after treatment","jeunes chats","chats sensibles","anorexia occurring within three to four days before presentation","premi\u00E8re ann\u00E9e de vie","interf\u00E9ron recombinant f\u00E9lin om\u00E9ga","enough efficient","depression","exposed","published protocol design","during","succ\u00E8s","administration d\u00E9crit","mati\u00E8res organiques","frequently fatal","nursing care","protocole","solid fomites","However","statut m\u00E9dical","temp\u00E9rature ambiante","hyperthermie","bact\u00E9ri\u00E9mie","mortalit\u00E9","If","th\u00E9rapie antivirale","jours","premiers signes cliniques","recours","anorexie","support solide","panleucop\u00E9nie f\u00E9line","Virtually","soins appropri\u00E9s","plupart des cas","alternative","l\u00E9thargie","place"],"language":"fr"},

Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment constitute an irreplaceable part in the handling of severe COVID-19 cases. Endoscopes, as reusable precision instruments with complicated structures, require more techniques than other medical devices in cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and other reprocessing procedures.

Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses. In accordance with the national standard \u201CRegulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016),\u201D we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.

In the typical antiviral pathway, activated RNase L degrades viral and cellular RNAs, thus limiting viral replication and spread. Although the antiviral activity of RNase L has been demonstrated for several RNA viruses, there is little evidence regarding its role against DNA viruses. In the present study, the potential antiviral activity of RNase L against hepatitis B virus (HBV) was explored utilizing the recently reported infection protocol based on human hepatoma HepG2 cells stably complemented with the virus entry factor NTCP. Viral replication and expression in this cell type was markedly inhibited by poly(I:C)- or 2\u20135A-mediated activation of RNase L; however, the inhibition was significantly reversed by RNase L knockdown. Further analysis in HBV1.2-transfected Huh-7 hepatoma cells indicated that the antiviral activity of RNase L depends on its ribonuclease function. We also provide evidence for the specific roles of OAS family members in this process. These results suggest that HBV replication can be regulated through interferon-mediated RNA decay pathways and that activation of these host antiviral factors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for HBV infection.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Il-Hyun; Kwon, Young-Chan; Ryu, Wang-Shick; Ahn, Byung-Yoon","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea51549ce92908ddc1d509a2269e512a83dfb54b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119188.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.01.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214000333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509240/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214000333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NTCP","OAS","HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential antiviral activity of RNase","Abstract RNase","mediated activation of RNase","HBV replication","viral replication","HBV infection","host antiviral factors","typical antiviral pathway","family of interferon","hepatoma cells","RNA viruses","dsRNA-activated enzymes","interferon-mediated RNA decay pathways","human hepatoma HepG2 cells","little evidence","cellular RNAs","specific ligands","cellular endoribonuclease","DNA viruses","specific roles of OAS family members","hepatitis B virus","reported infection protocol","virus entry factor NTCP","novel therapeutic strategy","cell type","oligoadenylate synthetases","expression","present study","poly","process","ribonuclease function","results","inhibition","linked oligoadenylates","analysis","HBV1","knockdown"],"language":"en"},

Microbiological investigations ruled out known viral agents but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) in diseased animals. We sequenced the genomes of 257 isolates of S. zooepidemicus to differentiate epidemic from endemic strains. We found that although multiple endemic clones of S. zooepidemicus were present, one particular clone, sequence type 209 (ST209), was likely to have been responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 was also recovered from a human case of septicemia, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this strain. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into one training yard during February 2010 provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses that then transmitted the strain to farms throughout Iceland. This study represents the first time that whole-genome sequencing has been used to investigate an epidemic on a national scale to identify the likely causative agent and the link to an associated zoonotic infection. Our data highlight the importance of national biosecurity to protect vulnerable populations of animals and also demonstrate the potential impact of S. zooepidemicus transmission to other animals, including humans.","publish_time":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bj\u00F6rnsd\u00F3ttir, Sigr\u00ED\u00F0ur; Harris, Simon R.; Svansson, Vilhj\u00E1lmur; Gunnarsson, Eggert; Sigur\u00F0ard\u00F3ttir, \u00D3l\u00F6f G.; Gammeljord, Kristina; Steward, Karen F.; Newton, J.

The performance analysis was conducted for two different purposes: (1) prediction of neutralization activity in MERS-CoV-infected patients, and (2) epidemiologic surveillance of MERS-CoV infections among MERS-CoV-exposed individuals. To evaluate performance according to serum collection time, we used \u2018days post onset of illness (dpoi)\u2019 and \u2018days post exposure (dpex)\u2019 assessing neutralization activity and infection diagnosis, respectively. Performance of serologic tests improved with delayed sampling time, being maximized after a seroconversion period. In predicting neutralization activity, ELISA IgG tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 21 dpoi at cut-off values of OD ratio 0.4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 100%), and ELISA IgA showed optimal performance using sera collected after 14 dpoi at cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 85.2% and specificity 100%). In diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, ELISA IgG exhibited optimal performance using sera collected after 28 dpex, at a cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 97.3% and specificity 92.9%). These new breakpoints are markedly lower than previously suggested values (ELISA IgG OD ratio 1.1, sensitivity 34.8% and specificity 100% in the present data set), and the performance data help serologic tests to be practically used in the field of MERS management.

Plasma, the starting material for these products, is collected by plasmapheresis (source plasma) or derived from whole blood donations (recovered plasma). The primary measures regarding pathogen safety are selection of healthy donors donating in centers with appropriate epidemiologic data for the main blood\u2010transmissible viruses, screening donations for the absence of relevant infectious blood\u2010borne viruses, and release of plasma pools for further processing only if they are nonreactive for serologic markers and nucleic acids for these viruses. Despite this testing, pathogen inactivation and/or removal during the manufacturing process of plasma\u2010derived clotting factor concentrates is required to ensure prevention of transmission of infectious agents. Historically, hepatitis viruses and human immunodeficiency virus have posed the greatest threat to patients receiving plasma\u2010derived therapy for treatment of hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Over the past 30 years, dedicated virus inactivation and removal steps have been integrated into factor concentrate production processes, essentially eliminating transmission of these viruses. Manufacturing steps used in the purification of factor concentrates have also proved to be successful in reducing potential prion infectivity. In this review, current techniques for inactivation and removal of pathogens from factor concentrates are discussed. Ideally, production processes should involve a combination of complementary steps for pathogen inactivation and/or removal to ensure product safety.

Additionally, being hydrophobic low molecular weight species, EPAC-specific inhibitors are prone to forming colloidal aggregates, which result in non-specific aggregation-based inhibition (ABI) in aqueous systems.

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u2013CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS\u2013CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS\u2013CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i \u002B 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity.

There is hence an urgent need to educate healthcare undergraduates early in their professional careers on the importance of and complexities involved in cooperating with counterparts from other allied healthcare professions. In conjunction with this, a milestone student-led conference for undergraduate students, the 9th Student Medical-Nursing Education Conference (SMEC), was organised in 2013 to provide a unique opportunity for shared learning among the entire cohort of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore matriculating in that year. METHODS: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the 9th SMEC 2013 as a shared conference experience in improving the attitudes of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore towards inter-professional education (IPE). A 19-point Readiness for Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire comprising three subscales was administered to participants both before and after the conference. 352 responses were collected, giving a response rate of 75.1 %. Results were analysed using paired-samples t-tests with statistical significance set at p = 0.05. RESULTS: Improvements in overall scores for both medical and nursing students were reported for all three RIPLS subscales. Examining the RIPLS items individually, significant improvement in scores for both medical and nursing students was obtained in all 19 items. Prior exposure to IPE activities was not a predictor of improvement in IPE attitudes. CONCLUSION: The authors propose that student-led jointly-organised conference experiences are effective in improving healthcare students\u2019 attitudes towards IPE. This study provides valuable insights to facilitate the development of further IPE programs to allow for the rapid and effective promotion of cooperation and collaboration between students across various healthcare disciplines.","publish_time":"2015-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chua, Amelia ZE; Lo, Daryl YK; Ho, Wilbert HH; Koh, Yun Qing; Lim, Daniel SY; Tam, John KC; Liaw, Sok Ying; Koh, Gerald CH","journal":"BMC Med Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1392d02729b5e2f1a63ff3ff259e10a8c45e5a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4690434.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-015-0509-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26698562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Student Medical-Nursing Education Conference","IPE","RIPLS"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["nursing students","undergraduate students","Student Medical-Nursing Education Conference","IPE attitudes","attitudes of undergraduate medical","healthcare undergraduates","healthcare students\u2019 attitudes","IPE activities","IPE programs","shared conference experience","organised conference experiences","entire cohort of undergraduate medical","RIPLS items","RIPLS subscales","inter-professional education","various healthcare disciplines","allied healthcare professions","Inter-Professional Learning Scale","shared learning","importance of collaboration","professional careers","multi-disciplinary healthcare teams","milestone student","SMEC","Results","study","Singapore matriculating","overall scores","significant improvement","predictor of improvement","effective promotion of cooperation","paired-samples t-tests","statistical significance","counterparts","cooperating","questionnaire","holistic patient care","improved treatment outcomes","complexities","development","Readiness","Improvements","unique opportunity","recent years","valuable insights","emphasis","effectiveness","Prior exposure","urgent need","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION","authors","conjunction","participants","response rate","responses"],"language":"en"},

This analysis is part of the World Health Organization Global Observatory on Health Research and Development\u2019s work with the overall aim to enable evidence-informed deliberations and decisions on new investments in health research and development. The analysis expands on the interactive data visualisations of these data on the Observatory\u2019s website and describes the methods used to enable the categorisation of grants by health categories using automated data-mining techniques. METHODS: Grants data were extracted from the World RePORT platform for 2016, the most recent year with data from all funders. A data-mining algorithm was developed in Java to categorise grants by health category. The analysis explored the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaborations between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with. RESULTS: Out of a total of 69,420 grants in 2016, the United States of America\u2019s National Institutes of Health funded the greatest number of grants (52,928; 76%) and had the longest average grant duration (6 years and 10 months). Grants for research constituted 70.4% (48,879) of all types of grants, followed by grants for training (13,008; 18.7%) and meetings (2907; 4.2%). Of grant recipients by income group, low-income countries received only 0.2% (165) of all grants. Almost three-quarters of all grants were for non-communicable diseases (72%; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20%; 11,123), and injuries (6%; 3056). Only 1.1% of grants were for neglected tropical diseases and 0.4% for priority diseases on the WHO list of highly infectious (R\u0026D blueprint) pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of considering funding decisions by other actors in future health research and capacity-strengthening decisions. This will not only improve efficiency and equity in allocating scarce resources but will also allow informed investment decisions that aim to support research on public health needs and neglected areas.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ralaidovy, Ambinintsoa H.; Adam, Taghreed; Boucher, Philippe","journal":"Health Res Policy Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9816051343f6acf13246fd5957e876a4db2c1ab7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7027210.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-0532-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization Global Observatory","Health Research and Development","National Institutes of Health"],"locations":["Java","United States"],"keyphrases":["Grants data","distribution of grants","categorisation of grants","types of grants","health category","future health research","recipients of direct grants","health categories","greatest number of grants","major funders of health research","public health needs","biomedical research","data-mining algorithm","World Health Organization Global Observatory","grant recipients","interactive data visualisations","analysis","automated data-mining techniques","United States of America\u2019s National Institutes of Health","type of grant","funding decisions","informed investment decisions","World RePORT platform","longest average grant duration","priority diseases","non-communicable diseases","tropical diseases","methods","overall aim","neglected areas","evidence-informed deliberations","new investments","Development\u2019s work","recipient country","organisation","actors","nature of collaborations","income group","years","capacity","Java","scarce resources","low-income countries","D blueprint","list","importance","nutritional conditions","Observatory\u2019s website","recent year","findings","efficiency","equity","pathogens","institutions","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","months","total","quarters","training","RESULTS","meetings","injuries"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We studied 124 children \u003C2 years old that were hospitalized for ALRI. Nutritional status was calculated by z-scores according to weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma leptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy. Results: Children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection than those with normal weight (71% obese vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.013; 68% overweight vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.004). A lower RSV load was found in obese (5.91 log(10) copies/mL) and overweight children (6.49 log(10) copies/mL) compared to normal weight children (8.06 log(10) copies/mL; p = 0.021 in both cases). In multivariate analysis, obese, and overweight infants \u003C6 months old were associated with longer hospital stays (RR = 1.68; CI: 1.30\u20132.15 and obese: RR = 1.68; CI: 1.01\u20132.71, respectively) as well as a greater duration of oxygen therapy (RR = 1.80; IC: 1.41\u20132.29 and obese: RR = 1.91; CI: 1.15\u20133.15, respectively). Obese children \u003C6 months showed higher plasma leptin level than normal weight children (7.58 vs. 5.12 ng/\u03BCl; p \u003C0.046). Conclusions: In infants younger than 6 months, overnutrition condition was related to increased severity of infections and high plasma leptin level. Also, children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection and low RSV viral load compared to normal weights children.

Results indicated that turbidity breakthrough was accompanied by breakthrough of all pathogens tested in this study. Results also suggest that the breakthrough of A. hydrophila and E. coli O157:H7 occurred more rapidly than that of turbidity. In general, filtration rate or alternative filter media configurations had no apparent effect on pathogen removal.","publish_time":"2003-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrington, Gregory W.; Xagoraraki, Irene; Assavasilavasukul, Prapakorn; Standridge, Jon H.","journal":"J Am Water Works Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7d8b61a332e98236d8ba5503327718c939df608.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159610.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1551-8833.2003.tb10514.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["breakthrough of","study","pathogen removal","turbidity breakthrough","alternative filter media configurations","effects of filter","H7","Results","alternative loading rates","removal of live emerging waterborne pathogens","enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O157","Aeromonas hydrophila","filtration rate","Encephalitozoon intestinalis spores","pilot","scale conventional treatment","alum coagulation","Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts","apparent effect","flocculation","time","sedimentation","bacteriophage MS2","microbes"],"language":"en"}]}

This multimorbid and frail population requires attention and a personalized comprehensive assessment in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes. As other diseases, the COVID-19 presentation in older patients is often atypical with less severe and unspecific symptoms. These subjects both at home and during hospitalization suffer isolation and the lack of support of caregivers. The geriatric care in COVID-19 wards is often missing. The application of additional instruments would be necessary to facilitate and personalize the clinical approach, not only based on diseases but also on functional status. This narrative review starts from diagnostic evaluation, continues with adapted pharmacologic treatment and ends with the recovery phase targeting the nutrition and physical exercise. We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastro-intestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners. As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease. Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection. We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function. This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauretani, Fulvio; Ravazzoni, Giulia; Roberti, Maria Federica; Longobucco, Yari; Adorni, Elisa; Grossi, Margherita; De Iorio, Aurelio; La Porta, Umberto; Fazio, Chiara; Gallini, Elena; Federici, Raffaele; Salvi, Marco; Ciarrocchi, Erika; Rossi, Francesca; Bergamin, Marina; Bussolati, Giacomo; Grieco, Ilaria; Broccoli, Federica; Zucchini, Irene; Ielo, Giuseppe; Morganti, Simonetta; Artoni, Andrea; Arisi, Arianna; Tagliaferri, Sara; Maggio, Marcello","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease phase","Covid","multisystem disease","older patients","multiple chronic diseases","frequent bacterial over-infection","recovery phase","older individuals","frail population","selection of treatment","unspecific symptoms","clinical phases","clinical approach","adapted pharmacologic treatment","thrombotic condition","attention","diagnostic evaluation","personalized comprehensive assessment","order","drugs","presentation","monitoring of renal","appropriateness of multidisciplinary","gastro-intestinal","hospitalization","isolation","liver","multidimensional intervention","nutrition","co-administration","lack of support","cardiac function","check-list","physical exercise","home","application of additional instruments","occurrence of adverse outcomes","quality","narrative review","nurses","general practitioners","geriatric care","wards","limitation","opportunity","subjects","caregivers","table","step","timing","functional status","role of age"],"language":"en"},

Tapentadol is a central analgesic with an improved tolerability profile that may be particularly beneficial to the elderly CLBP. METHODS We performed an observational retrospective study to comparatively assess the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol in young and elderly patients with severe CLBP. Sixtyfive young patients (\u003C 65 years) and 87 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P \u003C 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration. Treatment with tapentadol was associated with comparable and clinically meaningful pain reductions in 24-h NRS from baseline to treatment month-4 both in young and elderly patients (- 5.3 \u00B1 1.4 and - 4.8 \u00B1 2.1; P \u003C 0.01); a 50% pain relief was achieved in 66% and 58% of young and elderly patients. The percentage of patients with a neuropathic component decreased similarly in young and elderly patients (from 38 to 0% and from 19 to 3%; P \u003C 0.01). Quality of life and sleep improved. The performances in global cognition and sustained attention tasks remained stable or improved across all age group. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that tapentadol extended release maintains efficacy and good tolerability in CLBP patients with advancing age.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freo, Ulderico; Furnari, Maurizio; Ambrosio, Francesco; Navalesi, Paolo","journal":"Aging clinical and experimental research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01586-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elderly patients","CLBP patients","younger patients","percentage of patients","Sixtyfive young patients","elderly CLBP","durations of pain","tolerability of tapentadol","pain relief","neuropathic pain intensity","neuropathic pain symptoms","h pain intensity","treatment month","similar pain intensities","meaningful pain reductions","efficacy","tapentadol extended release","improved tolerability profile","good tolerability","tolerability outcomes","severe CLBP","neuropathic component","h NRS","baseline","years","sleep","quality of life","titration","advancing age","optimal dose","age group","battery of scales","lesser comorbidities","tests","intense depressive","sustained attention tasks","global cognition","central analgesic","performances","Numerical Rating Scale","findings","BACKGROUND Chronic low","adverse events","pretreatment","observational retrospective study","METHODS","gastrointestinal functions","maintenance periods","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","primary endpoint","condition","patient population","months"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. Keywords.

Outpatient Fever Clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution. Design: A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC. Methods: The FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p\u003C0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p\u003C0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p\u003C 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p\u003C0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected. Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital as well as offload ED resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiangshan; Zong, Liang; Zhang, Jinghong; Sun, Han; Joseph, Walline Harold; Sun, Pengxia; Xu, Shengyong; Li, Yan; Wang, Chunting; Liu, Jihai; Li, Fan; Xu, Jun; Li, Yi; Yu, Xuezhong; Zhu, Huadong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1799225d82dede5fb080f0b107415c1d3ef1970.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051813","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARS","FC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["critical patients","care patients","COVID","ill patients","outbreak","retrospective study of patients","FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital","mins","Screening results","hospital deaths of critical","vs","effect of upgraded FCs","medical care providers","offload ED resources","transfer information","total length","cross-sectional study","baseline patient information","Outpatient Fever Clinics","follow-up conditions","diagnoses","upper respiratory infection","major disease","PUMCH","prevention","cross-infected","emergency department","necessary data","large tertiary hospitals","population","work-load","Methods","Design","Conclusion","number","days","Participants","time","cases","SARS epidemic","period","Objectives","institution","China"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Respiratory infections are frequently encountered in the community; these infections are usually associated with only minor consequences. Many different agents, such as influenza and parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncitial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus and herpes virus can be found in immuno-competent patients. Among these pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been found to be responsible for nosocomial pneumonia in ICU. The main problem for viral infections, is the diagnosis, isolation of the pathogen is often difficult and not always reliable and the symptoms not specific. However, influenza is characterised by fever, myalgia, headache and pharyngitis, this infection may be very mild, even asymptomatic, moderate or very severe. Finally, the most recent viral pathogen involved in respiratory disease is a newly discovered coronavirus, the SARS-CoV which was responsible for the worldwide outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Viral pneumonia is a common pathology which is probably underdiagnosed in immuno-competent patients; many reports show that even if the diagnosis is difficult to obtain, it is not useless as long as we have, for most of the pathogens, an effective treatment. The gold standard was histology, new techniques like PCR can probably make a difference and should be included in the guidelines to improve diagnostic efficiency.","publish_time":"2004-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guery, B; d\u0027Escrivan, T; Georges, H; Legout, L; Leroy, O; Viget, N; Faure, K","journal":"R\u00E9animation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/000eec3f1e93c3792454ac59415c928ce3a6b4ad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1624069304000374; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1624069304000374","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Les"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus influenza","parainfluenza virus","herpes virus","virus responsable difficile","respiratory syncitial virus","virus respiratoire syncitial","viral infections","virus nouvellement d\u00E9couvert","Parmi ces virus","Abstract Respiratory infections","herp\u00E8s virus peuvent \u00EAtre isol\u00E9s chez","infections \u00E0 Inflenza","patients immunocomp\u00E9tents","infections virales respiratoires communautaires sont fr\u00E9quentes et","diagnostic est n\u00E9cessaire car","immuno-competent patients","discovered coronavirus","respiratory disease","diagnostic efficiency","Viral pneumonia","r\u00E9cent responsable d\u0027infection respiratoire est","peut \u00EAtre responsable","ad\u00E9novirus et","pneumonies virales sont fr\u00E9quentes mais probablement","difficile car","rhinovirus","ou para-influenza","Cependant","CMV","recent viral pathogen","diagnosis","pathogens","diagnostic repose sur l\u0027histologie mais","pharyngite est fr\u00E9quente dans","\u00E9t\u00E9 responsable d\u0027une \u00E9pid\u00E9mie d\u0027infections respiratoires s\u00E9v\u00E8res","nouvelles techniques comme","signes cliniques sont","sp\u00E9cifiques et l\u0027isolement","peuvent aboutir \u00E0","worldwide outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","diagnostiqu\u00E9es chez","new techniques","SRAS-CoV","tableaux s\u00E9v\u00E8res","SARS-CoV","nosocomial pneumonia","plus souvent b\u00E9nignes","Beaucoup d\u0027agents diff\u00E9rents comme","PCR doivent devenir d\u0027utilisation courante","myalgies","c\u00E9phal\u00E9es","plupart","am\u00E9liorer","une symptomatologie clinique associant fi\u00E8vre","cytom\u00E9galovirus","pathog\u00E8nes il existe","pneumonie nosocomiale en r\u00E9animation","histology","famille","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","adenovirus","traitement efficace","rendement diagnostique","headache","pharyngitis","gold standard","fever","myalgia","reports","isolation","common pathology","ICU","main problem","Enfin","different agents","symptoms","effective treatment","guidelines","cytomegalovirus","community","minor consequences","difference"],"language":"en"},

This meta-analysis aimed to find out the truth of COVID-19 related AKI and to provide stronger evidence. Methods: Two authors independently performed a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library fulfilled the pre-specified criteria until April 25, 2020 to include studies reported the necessary clinic characteristics, then the incidence of AKI, incidence of required RRT, the mortality with AKI and the death risk with AKI during COVID-19 infection were pooled for statistical analysis by Open Meta-Analyst software to get conclusions. Findings: It was found that the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is low, only about 3.8%; the in-hospital mortality with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is reach up to 32.6%; the death risk with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is about 16.1 times higher than those without AKI.

It becomes a severe public health disaster in one month. Find the period in which the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, and understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 in the period will provide valuable information for the countries facing the threats of COVID-2019. The most extensive epidemiological analysis of COVID-2019 shows that older people have lower infection rates compared to middle-aged persons. Common sense is that older people prefer to report their illness and get treatment from the hospital compared to middle-aged persons. We propose a hypothesis that when the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, we will find more older cases than the middle-aged cases. At first, we tested the hypothesis with 4597 COVID-2019 infected samples reported from 26th Nov 2019 to 17th Feb 2020 across the mainland of China. We found that 19th Jan 2020 is a critical time point. Few samples were reported before that day, and most of them were older ones. Then samples were explosively increased after that day, and many of them were middle-aged people. We have demonstrated the hypothesis to this step. Then, we grouped samples by their residences(provinces). We found that, in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong, the ages of samples reported before 19th Jan 2020 are significantly higher than the ages of samples reported after that day. It suggests the COVID-2019 may be spreading in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020 while people were unconscious of it. At last, we proposed that the ages distribution of each-day-reported samples could serve as a warning indicator of whether all potential COVID-2019 infected people are found. We think the power of our analysis is limit because 1. the work is data-driven, and 2. only ~5% of the COVID-2019 infected people in China are included in the study.

This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of \u00B11.3\u00B0C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of 10\u00D710\u00D70.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is operated digitally, portable and low power \u2013 capable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone). We were able to quantitatively detect a 563-bp fragment (Insertion Sequence IS900) of the genomic DNA of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (extracted from cultured field samples) through PCR in real-time with a Limit-of-Detection of 20 fg, equivalent to a single bacterium, at the 30th cycle.

Methods: Records were reviewed of 85 patients with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality at 28 days. Results: Fourteen patients died. The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2/FiO2, CD3\u002B count and CD4\u002B count. The percentage of neutrophil count \u003E 6.3*109/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count was independently associated with mortality.

Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions.

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, thus it is important to define the between antigenic cross-reactivity and neutralization. In this study, we firstly analyzed 20 convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that a palm civet SARS-CoV-derived RBD elicited more potent cross-neutralizing responses in immunized animals than the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, informing a strategy to develop a universe vaccine against emerging CoVs. Summary Serum antibodies from SARS-CoV infected patients and immunized animals cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 suggests strategies for universe vaccines against emerging CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Yuanmei; Yu, Danwei; Han, Yang; Yan, Hongxia; Chong, Huihui; Ren, Lili; Wang, Jianwei; Li, Taisheng; He, Yuxian","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.052126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infected patients","SARS-CoV infected individuals","SARS outbreak","palm civet SARS-CoV","human SARS-CoV strain","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","RBD immunogens of SARS","S2 proteins of SARS","derived RBD","immunized animals cross","potent cross","full-length S","antigenic cross-reactivity","S ectodomain","universe vaccines","emerging CoVs","S1 subunit","S protein-driven infections","cross-reactive neutralization","Summary Serum antibodies","convalescent serum samples","social stability","strategies","receptor-binding domain","serious threats","mice","public health","urgent need","rabbits","responses","pandemic","strategy","Multiple panels of antisera","therapeutics","patient sera","current COVID","study"],"language":"en"},

Estimating the expected impact of the lockdown, and the potential effectiveness of different exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in the \u00CEle-de-France region to (i) assess the current epidemic situation, (ii) evaluate the expected impact of the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020, and (iii) estimate the effectiveness of possible exit strategies. The model is calibrated on hospital admission data of the region before lockdown and validated on syndromic and virological surveillance data. Different types and durations of social distancing interventions are simulated, including a progressive lifting of the lockdown targeted on specific classes of individuals (e.g. allowing a larger proportion of the population to go to work, while protecting the elderly), and large-scale testing. We estimate the basic reproductive number at 3.0 [2.8, 3.2] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and the population infected by COVID-19 as of April 5 to be in the range 1% to 6%. The average number of contacts is predicted to be reduced by 80% during lockdown, leading to a substantial reduction of the reproductive number (RLD = 0.68 [0.62-0.73]). Under these conditions, the epidemic curve reaches ICU system capacity and slowly decreases during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave largely overwhelming the healthcare system. Extensive case-finding, testing and isolation are required to envision social distancing strategies that gradually relax current constraints (larger fraction of individuals going back to work, progressive reopening of activities), while keeping schools closed and seniors isolated. As France faces the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Domenico, Laura; Pullano, Giulia; Sabbatini, Chiara E.; Bo\u00EBlle, Pierre-Yves; Colizza, Vittoria","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c319ff58b6075559e61eb937bd8f3794e578f30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063933","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["lockdown","social distancing strategies","social contacts","strict forms of social distancing","intensive forms of social distancing","durations of social distancing interventions","global population","wave of COVID","effectiveness of possible exit strategies","potential effectiveness of different exit strategies","work","ICU system capacity","exit strategy","isolation","healthcare system","low population immunity","average number of contacts","basic reproductive number","progressive lifting","expected impact","Extensive case","hospital admission data","virological surveillance data","larger fraction of individuals","current epidemic situation","age profile","current constraints","Different types","epidemic curve","\u00CEle-de-France region","healthcare demand","larger proportion","large-scale testing","stochastic age-structured transmission model","specific classes of individuals","progressive reopening of activities","socio-economic pressure","extreme measures","decision makers","pandemic","substantial reduction","partial release","management","logistics","upcoming months","schools","conditions","elderly","RLD","countries","Response planning needs","health crisis","confidence interval","seniors isolated","half","range"],"language":"en"},

It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8\u002B T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8\u002B T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our results suggest that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19.

Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality, the secondary endpoints were organ dysfunction and septic shock incidence. Results: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. As of March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median hospital stay was 12.0 days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days.

Participants Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. Interventions Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. Measurements and Main Results Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease.

However, unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 480 full-length (\u003E29000 nt) sequences from the 1575 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available and identified 37 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in \u003E1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif as hotspots for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly, two of the 37 substitutions occur within highly conserved secondary structures in the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions that are critical for the virus life cycle. Furthermore, clustering analysis revealed unique geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile. Of note, we observed several co-occurring mutations that almost never occur individually. We define 3 mutually exclusive lineages (A1, B1 and C1) of SARS-CoV-2 which account for about three quarters of the genomes analysed. We identify lineage-defining leading mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which precede the occurrence of sub-lineage defining trailing mutations. The identification of mutually exclusive lineage-defining mutations with geographically restricted patterns of distribution has potential implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design.

To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2). Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khera, R.; Dhingra, L.

As low\u2013molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low\u2013molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Jia; Zhang, Liang; Liu, Xiaodan; Li, Fudong; Ma, Rongsheng; Zhu, Zhongliang; Zhang, Jiahai; Wu, Jihui; Shi, Yunyu; Pan, Yueyin; Ge, Yushu; Ruan, Ke","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf42a27399c98d8e6588694d9f31ecc3337dbd10.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079848","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular-weight drugs","specific drugs","essential SARS-CoV","niacin","fragment-based approach","catalytic pocket of Mpro","feasible strategy","potential targets","enzymatic activity of Mpro","capable of inhibiting protease activity","large molecular sizes","fragment screening approaches","feasible method","high potential","main protease","binding sites","coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","derivatives","infection","interactions","bendamustine","pandemic","protein","triclabendazole","emedastine","pharmacophores","Drug repurposing","emergency treatment","partial overlap","carmofur","COVID","Chemical shift perturbations","global healthcare system","ligand","study"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge of random testing outcomes will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mueller, Markus; Derlet, Peter; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4067dfad4918e578726b43965ccb217df035d36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fraction of infected people","quantitative effect of restrictive measures","real-time assessment","Knowledge of random testing outcomes","tested people","daily sampling","noisy sampling data","frequent sampling","pandemic","current fraction of infections","higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences","real time","transmission rates","reliable data","order of magnitude higher","key variable","shorter delay times","efficiency of new means","level","number","evolution","analysis of sewage water","homogeneous population","control model of mitigation","conservative estimate","present ones","day","relaxation of restrictions","reboot","load","healthcare system","optimized decisions","progression","feedback","place","symptomatic individuals","disease","size","COVID","predictability"],"language":"en"},

Methods Demographic, clinical, and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals with confirmed Covid-19 between February 27 and April 2, 2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We conducted a descriptive study of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive. Results A total of 2,199 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized during the study period. As of April 2nd, 1,121 (51%) patients remained hospitalized, and 1,078 (49%) completed their hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Pre-existing conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 162 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.44 ng/mL.

Our results demonstrate use of self-reported data to inform public health policy and resource allocation.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bowyer, Ruth; Varsavsky, Thomas; Sudre, Carole H; Murray, Benjamin; Freidin, Maxim; Yarand, Darioush; Ganesh, Sajaysurya; Capdevila, Joan; Thompson, Ellen J; Bakker, Elco; Cardoso, M Jorge; Davies, Richard; Wolf, Jonathan; Spector, Tim D; Ourselin, Sebastien; Steves, Claire J; Menni, Cristina","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076521v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urban areas","prevalence","use of self-reported data","geographical distribution of COVID","COVID Symptom Tracker app","disease severity","areas of higher deprivation","significant evidence of urban hot-spots","unique GB users","public health policy","key","resources","geo-social gradient","provision of adequate healthcare services","resource allocation","pandemic","general population","results","declaration","month","UK"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2\u2019 or 3\u2019 modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses\u2019 exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3\u2019-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2\u2019-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2\u2019-fluoro-dUTP, 2\u2019-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2\u2019 -OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3\u2019-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2\u2019-OH, have a blocked 2\u2019-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus, they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jockusch, Steffen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Li, Xiaoxu; Anderson, Thomas K.; Chien, Minchen; Kumar, Shiv; Russo, James J.; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Ju, Jingyue","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/beb6350da21fa5d4a81298c6afd468945a431840.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.058776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emtricitabine","RNA","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleotide analogues","Ganciclovir triphosphate","Stavudine triphosphate","Entecavir triphosphate","Carbovir triphosphate","SARS-CoV","library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues","polymerase reaction","RdRps of SARS","coronavirus RdRps","delayed termination","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir","O-methyl UTP","RNA synthesis","exhibited immediate termination","coronavirus family","amino-dUTP","fluoro-dUTP","viruses\u2019 exonuclease activity","potential therapies","OH group","coronavirus genomes","modifications","Cidofovir diphosphate","chemical features","displayed incorporation","current COVID","form Watson-Cricklike base pairs","Alovudine","variety of structural","Zidovudine","Valganciclovir","Abacavir","inhibitors","Brincidofovir","Tenofovir alafenamide","viral infections","FDA","ability","mismatched bases","safety profile","Emtricitabine","dideoxynucleotides","worldwide pandemic","molecules","evaluation","Desthiobiotin","member","regard","sugar","property","study","goal","prodrugs","terminus","future"],"language":"en"},

Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, X.-w.; Chi, Z.-p.; Liu, G.-y.; Huang, H.; Guo, S.-q.; Fan, J.-r.; Lin, X.-w.; Qu, L.-z.; Chen, R.-l.; Wu, L.-j.; Wang, L.-y.; Zhang, Q.-c.; Wu, S.-w.; Pan, Z.-q.; Lin, H.; Zhou, Y.-h.; Zhang, Y.-h.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42fd59678b98ad2d5416d95b54118d3dfbdd2f30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.07.20032599v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["UACR","IGU","TRU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of early renal injury","incidence of early renal injury","degree of early renal injury","degree of renal injury","diagnosis of COVID","incidence of COVID","patients","IGU","A1M","Combined detection of UMA","descriptive study","TRU","urinary creatinine ratio","diagnostic value of urine microalbumin","serum creatinine","Ccr","urine immunoglobulin-G","value of multi-index","Urinary microprotein detection","primary outcome","UACR","endogenous creatinine clearance","neutrophil ratio","Secondary outcomes","abnormal rates of eGFR","CRP","estimated glomerular filtration rate","significant abnormalities","blood urea nitrogen","BUN","area","curve","C-reactive protein","AUC","microglobulin","hyponatremia","tertiary hospital","Guangdong","China","NER","infection","Hypokalemia","combination","correlation","Conclusions","Spearman analysis","Results","Objectives","aim","Participants"],"language":"en"},

Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2. Methods In this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON\u00AE (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. Results To test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions. Conclusions Using this bioinformatic platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes for CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population and thus may be effective when included in prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to induce broad cellular immunity.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poran, Asaf; Harjanto, Dewi; Malloy, Matthew; Rooney, Michael S.; Srinivasan, Lakshmi; Gaynor, Richard B.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b817fd8189755f2b5c72cb80e7b76af937f8eae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027805","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology","HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["validated HLA","SARS-CoV","SARS CoV","HLA binding properties","predicted peptide-HLA","significant number of HLA","proteomic profiling of individual HLA","SARS outbreak","viral T cell epitopes","peptide binding","binding predictors","candidate binding peptides","alleles","cell-mediated immunity","Coronaviridae family epitopes","T cell epitope prediction tools","T cells","protective immunity","ViPR database","allele pairs","reported pairs","multiple putative epitopes","ORFs","predictions","positive MHC-binding assay result","Virus Pathogen Database","broad cellular immunity","protective role","viral genomes","Analysis Resource","bioinformatic platform","bioinformatic pipeline","extensive list of identified candidate peptides","Real-time Epitope Computation","RECON","CD8","CD4","novel vaccine targets","open reading frames","ONcology","early reports","related coronavirus responsible","rules","entire population","diverse set","urgency","Asian populations","length","prophylactic vaccines","pandemic","suitability","observations","ongoing COVID","coverage","Conclusions","forms of coronaviruses","validity","study","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

To further evaluate the influence of the delay on the long term system dynamics, the sensitivity analysis is performed on time delay. The most crucial parameter, basic reproduction number R0 and its time-dependent generalization, has been estimated at both regional and sub regional levels. The impact of the most significant lockdown measure that has been implemented in India to contain the pandemic spread has been extensively studied by considering no lockdown scenario.

For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions.

The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient\u0027s COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayham, Jude; Fenichel, Eli P","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13d02046932e1c3007fb9a63fdd4a497ec70e7a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033415","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Current Population Survey"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["healthcare households","benefits of school closures","mandatory school closures","Conclusion School closures","healthcare system","healthcare occupations","school closings","healthcare labor force","healthcare provider households","incremental effect of school closures","US healthcare sector","US healthcare workers","impact of school closure","percent healthcare worker","importance of healthcare labor supply","healthcare workforce declines","potential child care obligations","potential loss of healthcare workers","additional child care obligations","highest child care obligations","costs of healthcare worker absenteeism","cumulative mortality","cummulative mortality","unintended childcare obligations","infection mortality rate","baseline mortality rate","patient\u0027s COVID","need of childcare","Background COVID","United States","single-parent households","home health aide households","survival probability","tradeoffs","cases","social distancing measure","potential contagion prevention","US Current Population Survey","reasonable parameters","net reduction","implementation of social distancing policies","Detailed data","medical assistants","case reduction","economic costs","public health officials","emergency medical personnel","transmission","sibling","years old","informed decisions","role","nursing","world","segments","standpoint","lives","household structure","critical level","non-working adults","spread","evidence","considerable uncertainty","models","experience","influenza","greater number of deaths","substantial variation","Findings","children","closing schools","estimates","example","percentage points","Methods","pathogen","results"],"language":"en"},

Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex. These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar/charged residues appear at the interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV. Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even far from the binding interface. Our results on the molecular differences in the binding between the two viruses can provide important inputs for development of appropriate antiviral treatments of the new viruses, addressing the necessity of ongoing pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Hien T.

Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score [\u2265]2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013). Conclusions This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regina, J.; Papadimitriou-Olivgeris, M.; Burger, R.; Filippidis, P.; Tschopp, J.; Desgranges, F.; Viala, B.; Kampouri, E.; Rochat, L.; Haefliger, D.; Belkoniene, M.; Fidalgo, C.; Kritikos, A.; Jaton, K.; Senn, L.; Bart, P.-A.; Pagani, J.-L.; Manuel, O.; Lhopitallier, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20097741v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["adult patients","increased odds of mechanical ventilation","days","clinical course of patients","risk factors","high risk","SARS-CoV","high qSOFA score","epidemiology of COVID","bilateral infiltrate","CRP","infection","retrospective observational study","bilateral radiological infiltrate","Multivariable regression","severe disease","European tertiary hospital","multivariate logistic regression","Swiss university hospital","Background Coronavirus disease","clinicians","symptoms onset","insight","progression","need","males","Male sex","median time","USA","laboratory","primary outcome","data","electronic health records","global pandemic","Methods","IQR","epicenter","Conclusions","Follow-up","Results"],"language":"en"},

Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike remdesivir, enisamium does not require intravenous administration which may be advantageous for the development of COVID-19 treatments outside a hospital setting. Importance Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 are respiratory viruses capable of causing pandemics, and the latter is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Both viruses encode RNA polymerases which transcribe their RNA genomes and are important targets for antiviral drugs including remdesivir. Here, we show that the antiviral drug enisamium inhibits the RNA polymerases of both influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that a putative metabolite of enisamium is a more potent inhibitor, inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase with similar efficiency to remdesivir. Our data offer insight into the mechanism of action for enisamium, and implicate it as a broad-spectrum antiviral which could be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, Alexander P; Fan, Haitian; Keown, Jeremy R; Margitich, Victor; Grimes, Jonathan M; Fodor, Ervin; te Velthuis, Aartjan J W","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.053017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","World Health Organisation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","pandemic SARS-CoV","RNA virus infections","RNA polymerases","RNA genomes","viral RNA polymerase","viral RNA synthesis","treatment of SARS","broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis","antiviral drug enisamium","circulating influenza","Importance Influenza","putative metabolite of enisamium","emerging pandemic influenza","Coronavirus Disease","inhibitor of multiple influenza B","coronavirus strains","coronavirus infections","broad-spectrum antiviral","antiviral drugs","respiratory viruses capable","potent inhibitor","vaccines","severe respiratory disease","alternative antiviral strategies","development of COVID","VR17","nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate","candidate therapeutic","similar efficacy","similar efficiency","key drug target","possible therapeutic option","important targets","mechanism of action","isonicotinic acid derivative","treatments","World Health Organisation","cell culture","pandemics","causative agent","data offer insight","intravenous administration","assays","activity","hospital setting","death","results","countries"],"language":"en"},

Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient\u0027s age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.","publish_time":"2011-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruuskanen, Olli; Lahti, Elina; Jennings, Lance C; Murdoch, David R","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1c95fc0ea9e1ab3de0a2adde0097bc7ba70c005.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673610614596; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673610614596","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cause of pneumonia","incidence of viral pneumonia","bacterial pneumonia","cases of viral community","obvious viral community","evidence of viral","role of viruses","cases of community","pathogenesis of community","particular influenza viruses","Presence of viral epidemics","Dual viral infections","parainfluenza viruses","children","adults","clear role","Influenza vaccines","predominant role","developing countries","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","clear consensus","use of specific antivirals","bacterial co-infection","putative causative agents","available specific preventive measures","biomarkers","symptoms","illness","speed of onset","patient\u0027s age","respiratory syncytial virus","radiographic changes","response","treatment","understanding","rhinoviruses","patients","findings","neuraminidase inhibitors","data","coronaviruses","regional differences","year","Molecular diagnostic tests","Summary","clinical algorithm","antibiotics","studies"],"language":"en"},

As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the following 12 heavily-attacked countries: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and South Africa. Methods: We downloaded the publicly available COVID-19 pandemic data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard website (https://covid19.who.int/) for the duration of January 11, 2020 and May 1, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating R0(t) in the R software. Results: We plotted the epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases for the 12 selected countries. A clear peak of the epidemic curve appeared in 10 of the 12 selected countries at various time points, and then the epidemic curve declined gradually. However, the United States of America and South Africa happened to have two or more peaks and their epidemic curves either reached a plateau or still climbed up. Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) [\u2265] 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries. By contrast, Spain, Germany, and France with smaller values of the estimated R0(t) were relatively better than the other 9 countries. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urge public health authorities and scientists to estimate R0(t) routinely during an epidemic of infectious disease and to report R0(t) daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, F.-C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c75d0f053c254c8fd69636e459adca0ff72a0552.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20097154v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran","Germany","Belgium","United States","South Africa","Singapore","South Korea","Japan","France"],"keyphrases":["estimated R0","South Africa","approximate R0","selected countries","epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases","South Korea","ongoing epidemic of infectious disease","United States of America","data of daily new confirmed cases","daily number of new confirmed cases","pandemic data","ongoing pandemic","available COVID","United Kingdom","coronavirus disease","various time points","various time periods","Japan","Germany","France","Iran","Spain","time-varying reproduction number","Singapore","end","public health authorities","incidence","Italy","Belgium","smaller values","novel estimation method","EpiEstim packages","scientists","plausible distributions of serial interval","drops","clear peak","Dashboard website","R software","harshest battles","contrast","progression","Conclusion","Results","peaks","plateau","measure of transmissibility","duration","Methods","Background"],"language":"en"},

The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. METHODS As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. RESULTS We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. CONCLUSION This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, S.; Taylor, K.; Pearson, M.; Kozubek, J.; Pawlowski, M.; Jensen, C.

Among them, 78 patients with pneumonia disease and treated with tocilizumab were further evaluated for a severe outcome (encompassing both the use of mechanical ventilation and/or death). Thirty-one (39.7%) hyperglycemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycemic Covid-19 positive patients (blood glucose levels \u003E140 mg/dl, at admission and/or during hospital stay) were evaluated. Noteworthy, 20 (64%) of hyperglycemic and 11 (23.4%) of normoglycemic patients were also diabetics (P\u003C0.01). At admission, more elevated IL-6 levels in hyperglycemic patients were found and persists even after Tocilizumab administration. In a risk adjusted Cox-regression analysis, Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic did not attenuate the risks of severe outcome as did in normoglycemic patients (p\u003C0.009). Therefore, we could conclude that reduced effects of Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic patients may due to the higher plasma IL-6 levels. Interestingly, when we added IL-6 levels in a Cox regression model the significance for the tocilizumab effect was lost (p\u003C0.07). In this context, our observations evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marfella, R.; Paolisso, P.; Sardu, C.; Bergamaschi, L.; D\u0027 Angelo, E.

No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 \u03BCM of MMPD, viral titers were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop. The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 \u03BCM significantly reduced viral titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection.

A potential target for this strategy is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), for which, despite decades of efforts, no vaccine is available. In particular, a therapeutic vaccine devised to eliminate infected cells would represent a key component of cure strategies. HIV peptides designed based on individual viro-immunological data from people living with HIV/AIDS have recently shown able to induce post-therapy viral set point abatement. However, the reproducibility and scalability of this method is curtailed by the errors and arbitrariness associated with manual peptide design as well as by the time-consuming process. We herein introduce Custommune, a user-friendly web tool to design personalized and population-targeted vaccines. When applied to HIV-1, Custommune predicted personalized epitopes using patient specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and viral sequences, as well as the expected HLA-peptide binding strength and potential immune escape mutations. Of note, Custommune predictions compared favorably with manually designed peptides administered in a recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02961829). Furthermore, we utilized Custommune to design preventive vaccines targeted for populations highly affected by COVID-19. The results allowed the identification of peptides tailored for each population and predicted to elicit both CD8\u002B T-cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies against structurally conserved epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Overall, our data describe a new tool for rapid development of personalized or population-based immunotherapy against chronic and acute viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tarek, M.; Elhefnawi, M.; Maricato, J.

We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness.

Results Among the 2944 subjects in our study, 2415 were included in the low-risk group, including 997 doctors and 1418 nurses with average ages of 37.38 and 33.56 years, respectively; 529 were included in the high-risk group, including 122 doctors and 407 nurses with average ages of 35.24 and 32.16 years, respectively. The 28-day incidence of COVID-19 was zero in both the high- and low-risk groups. The 28-day incidence of new-onset clinical symptoms with negative images for pneumonia was also zero in both the high- and low-risk groups. As controls, a total of 2035 medical personnel with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from the same area (Hubei Province) was observed between January 21 to February 23, 2020. There were no serious adverse effects in the 2944 subjects treated during the intervention period. Conclusion In this investigator-initiated open-label study, we observed that rhIFN-\u03B1 nasal drops can effectively prevent COVID-19 in treated medical personnel. Our results also indicate that rhIFN-\u03B1 nasal drops have potential promise for protecting susceptible healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Zhongji; Wang, Tongyu; Li, Chen; Chen, Xinhe; Li, Longti; Qin, Xueqin; Li, Hai; Luo, Jie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b39a55126ee065810b165369a651ca853917ff1c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061473","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rhIFN-\u03B1 nasal drops","interferon nasal drops","high-risk group","new-onset COVID","low-risk groups","medical personnel","healthy medical staff","day incidence of COVID","medical staff members","day incidence of new","confirmed COVID","results","new-onset fever","areas of Hubei Province","open-label study","onset clinical symptoms","negative images","doctors","number of new cases","pneumonia","average ages","subjects","coronavirus pandemic","nurses","days","years","negative pulmonary images","novel coronavirus disease","respiratory symptoms","secondary outcome","primary outcome","Adverse reactions","intervention period","susceptible healthy people","serious adverse effects","safety of recombinant human interferon alpha1b","potential promise","Shiyan City","efficacy","Taihe Hospital","thymosin-\u03B11","times","total","investigator","Wuhan","hypodermic injection","Methods","nostril","Participants","week","Objective","Conclusion","controls"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate existing literature for factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity. Methods: A systematic review identified all studies published between 1/12/19 and 19/4/20 that used primary data and inferential statistics to assess associations between the outcome of interest - disease severity - and historical or clinical variables. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the WHO Database of Publications on Coronavirus Disease were searched. Data were independently extracted and cross-checked independently by two reviewers using PRISMA guidelines, after which they were descriptively analysed. Quality and risk of bias in available evidence were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. This review was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42020178098. Results: Of the 6202 relevant articles found, 63 were eligible for inclusion; these studies analysed data from 17648 COVID-19 patients. The majority (n=57, 90.5%) were from China and nearly all (n=51, 90.5%) focussed on admitted adult patients. Patients had a median age of 52.5 years and 52.8% were male. The predictors most frequently associated with COVID-19 disease severity were age, absolute lymphocyte count, hypertension, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and history of any pre-existing medical condition. Conclusion: This study identified multiple variables likely to be predictive of severe COVID-19 illness. Due to the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is currently no severity prediction tool designed to, or validated for, COVID-19 illness severity. Findings may inform such a tool that can offer guidance on clinical treatment and disposition, and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality due to the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pigoga, Jennifer L; Friedman, Alexandra; Broccoli, Morgan; Hirner, Sarah; Naidoo, Antoinette Vanessa; Singh, Swasthi; Werner, Kalin; Wallis, Lee A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/037ecc89d99be71ea27ea32779354efe1c2796e2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076653v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["disease severity","illness severity","predictive of severe COVID","severity prediction tool","adult patients","clinical variables","Coronavirus Disease","study","studies","primary data","rapid assessment methods","median age","clinical treatment","urgent need","systematic review","multiple variables likely","absolute lymphocyte count","hypertension","lactate dehydrogenase","LDH","Development","history","challenging decisions","C-reactive protein","Evaluations","pathways of care","available evidence","Grading of Recommendations","inferential statistics","frontline providers","risk of bias","CRP","PROSPERO","disposition","GRADE","associations","guidance","existing literature","outcome","factors","Web of Science","Database of Publications","registration number CRD42020178098","morbidity","relevant articles","PubMed","Scopus","pre-existing medical condition","Quality","rationing of resources","framework","years","Conclusion","infection","inclusion","novelty of SARS","reviewers","PRISMA guidelines","mortality","pandemic","Results","Background","male","majority","China","Findings","predictors"],"language":"en"},

Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I.

Objectives This study was undertaken to analyze nucleotide sequences of the matrix (M) gene of AIVs isolated from wild birds and live bird markets (LBMs) to index the changes occurring in this gene. Methods M\u2010gene of 229 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates obtained from wild birds and LBMs was amplified and sequenced. Full\u2010length sequences (\u223C900 nt.) thus obtained were analyzed to identify changes that may be associated with resistance to adamantanes. Phylogenetic analysis of all sequences was performed using clustalw, and evolutionary distances were calculated by maximum composite likelihood method using mega (ver. 5.0) software. Results Twenty\u2010seven different viral subtypes were represented with H3N8 being the most dominant subtype in wild birds and H7N2 being the predominant subtype among isolates from LBMs. Phylogenetic analysis of the M\u2010gene showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity with US isolates of AIVs but not with those of Asian or European lineages. While none of the isolates from wild birds had any antiviral resistance\u2013associated mutations, 17 LBM isolates carried polymorphisms known to cause reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs (adamantanes). Of these 17 isolates, 16 had S31N change and one isolate had V27A mutation. Conclusions These results indicate independent evolution of M\u2010gene in the absence of any antiviral drugs leading to mutations causing resistance indicating the need for continued active surveillance of AIVs.","publish_time":"2012-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chander, Yogesh; Jindal, Naresh; Sreevatsan, Srinand; Stallknecht, David E.; Goyal, Sagar M.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac45f663ed3b7143b944a5385b5d82754087a6af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4941746.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene of AIVs","Background Wild birds","LBM isolates","US isolates of AIVs","phylogenetic analysis of matrix gene of avian influenza viruses","antiviral resistance","LBMs","antiviral drugs","nucleotide sequences","live bird markets","associated mutations","Respiratory Viruses","Results","adamantanes","Full\u2010length sequences","changes","active surveillance of AIVs","predominant subtype","high degree of nucleotide sequence identity","H7N2","natural hosts","reduced susceptibility","maximum composite likelihood method","H3N8","polymorphisms","need","evolutionary distances","S31N change","different viral subtypes","independent evolution","IAVs","V27A mutation","niche","Conclusions","clustalw","study","USA","absence","European lineages","Chander","maintenance","Methods","paper","Objectives","software"],"language":"en"},

To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers. We estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of the case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. To take into account the heterogeneity between and within countries, we fitted a mixed effects model and calculated R(0) based on the predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution. At district level, R(0) ranged from 0.36 (Dubr\u00E9ka) to 1.72 (Beyla) in Guinea, from 0.53 (Maryland) to 3.37 (Margibi) in Liberia and from 1.14 (Koinadugu) to 2.73 (Western Rural) in Sierra Leone.

Recently such an epidemic occurred due to the emergence of avian influenza virus of the subtype H10N7 (Seal/H10N7) in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). This epidemic caused high mortality in seals along the north-west coast of Europe and represented a potential risk for human health. To characterize the spectrum of lesions and to identify the target cells and viral distribution, findings in 16 harbor seals spontaneously infected with Seal/H10N7 are described. The seals had respiratory tract inflammation extending from the nasal cavity to bronchi associated with intralesional virus antigen in respiratory epithelial cells. Virus infection was restricted to the respiratory tract. The fatal outcome of the viral infection in seals was most likely caused by secondary bacterial infections. To investigate the pathogenic potential of H10N7 infection for humans, we inoculated the seal virus intratracheally into six ferrets and performed pathological and virological analyses at 3 and 7 days post inoculation. These experimentally inoculated ferrets displayed mild clinical signs, virus excretion from the pharynx and respiratory tract inflammation extending from bronchi to alveoli that was associated with virus antigen expression exclusively in the respiratory epithelium. Virus was isolated only from the respiratory tract. In conclusion, Seal/H10N7 infection in naturally infected harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets shows that respiratory epithelial cells are the permissive cells for viral replication. Fatal outcome in seals was caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia similar to that in fatal human cases during influenza pandemics. Productive infection of ferrets indicates that seal/H10N7 may possess a zoonotic potential. This outbreak of LPAI from wild birds to seals demonstrates the risk of such occasions for mammals and thus humans.","publish_time":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Brand, Judith M.

Immunoproteasomes are specialized types of proteasomes involved in shaping adaptive immune responses, but their role in innate immune signaling is still elusive. Here, we analyzed immunoproteasome function for polarization of alveolar macrophages, highly specialized tissue macrophages of the alveolar lung surface. Classical activation (M1 polarization) of primary alveolar macrophages by LPS/IFN\u03B3 transcriptionally induced all three immunoproteasome subunits, low molecular mass protein 2 (LMP2), LMP7 and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1, which was accompanied by increased immunoproteasome activity in M1 cells. Deficiency of LMP7 had no effect on the LPS/IFN\u03B3-triggered M1 profile indicating that immunoproteasome function is dispensable for classical alveolar macrophage activation. In contrast, IL-4 triggered alternative (M2) activation of primary alveolar macrophages was accompanied by a transcriptionally independent amplified expression of LMP2 and LMP7 and an increase in immunoproteasome activity. Alveolar macrophages from LMP7 knockout mice disclosed a distorted M2 profile upon IL-4 stimulation as characterized by increased M2 marker gene expression and CCL17 cytokine release. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of IL-4-responsive genes and of genes involved in cellular response to defense, wounding and inflammation in LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages indicating a distinct M2 inflammation resolving phenotype. Moreover, augmented M2 polarization was accompanied by amplified AKT/STAT6 activation and increased RNA and protein expression of the M2 master transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 in LMP7(\u2212/\u2212) alveolar macrophages. IL-13 stimulation of LMP7-deficient macrophages induced a similar M2-skewed profile indicative for augmented signaling via the IL-4 receptor \u03B1 (IL4R\u03B1). IL4R\u03B1 expression was generally elevated only on protein but not RNA level in LMP7(\u2212/\u2212) alveolar macrophages. Importantly, specific catalytic inhibition with an LMP7-specific proteasome inhibitor confirmed augmented IL-4-mediated M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages. Our results thus suggest a novel role of immunoproteasome function for regulating alternative activation of macrophages by limiting IL4R\u03B1 expression and signaling.","publish_time":"2016-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, S; Kammerl, I E; Vosyka, O; Baumann, T; Yu, Y; Wu, Y; Irmler, M; Overkleeft, H S; Beckers, J; Eickelberg, O; Meiners, S; Stoeger, T","journal":"Cell Death Differ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56f99487f13b5e7b13e7983c2913188c41ad0761.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4987736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987736/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages","activation of primary alveolar macrophages","mediated M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages","deficient macrophages","alternative activation of macrophages","stimulation of LMP7","augmented M2 polarization","Deficiency of LMP7","specialized tissue macrophages","classical alveolar macrophage activation","augmented IL","distorted M2 profile","protein expression","alveolar lung surface","IL4R\u03B1 expression","distinct M2 inflammation","LMP7 knockout mice","increased immunoproteasome activity","increased M2 marker gene expression","LMP7-specific proteasome inhibitor","Classical activation","immunoproteasome subunits","M1 polarization","enrichment of IL","STAT6 activation","novel role of immunoproteasome function","similar M2-skewed profile indicative","IFN\u03B3-triggered M1 profile","increased RNA","independent amplified expression of LMP2","M2 master transcription factor interferon regulatory factor","triggered alternative","M1 cells","LPS","low molecular mass protein","amplified AKT","responsive genes","RNA level","innate immune","central regulatory hub","specialized types of proteasomes","specific catalytic inhibition","adaptive immune responses","CCL17 cytokine release","defense","cellular response","Comparative transcriptome analysis","effect","multicatalytic endopeptidase complex","Immunoproteasomes","phenotype","receptor \u03B1","contrast","mediators","results"],"language":"en"},

AIMS: The objective of the study was to evaluate cases developing pneumothorax following admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over a 5-year period. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Case notes of all PICU patients (n = 1298) were reviewed, revealing that 135 cases (10.4%) developed pneumothorax, and these were compared with those patients who did not. The most common tool for diagnosis used was chest X-ray followed by a clinical examination. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Case notes of 1298 patients admitted in PICU over 1-year study. RESULTS: Patients with pneumothorax had higher mortality rate (P \u003C 0.001), longer length of stay (P \u003C 0.001), higher need for mechanical ventilation (MV) (P \u003C 0.001), and were of younger age (P \u003C 0.001), lower body weight (P \u003C 0.001), higher pediatric index of mortality 2 score on admission (P \u003C 0.001), higher pediatric logistic organ dysfunction score (P \u003C 0.001), compared to their counterpart. Iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP) represented 95% of episodes of pneumothorax. The most common causes of IP were barotrauma secondary to MV, central vein catheter insertion, and other (69.6%, 13.2%, and 17.2%, respectively). Compared to ventilated patients without pneumothorax, ventilated patients who developed pneumothorax had a longer duration of MV care (P \u003C 0.001) and higher nonconventional and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation settings (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that pneumothorax is common in Alexandria University PICU patients, especially in those on MV and emphasized the importance of the strict application of protective lung strategies among ventilated patients to minimize the risk of pneumothorax.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Nawawy, Ahmed Ahmed; Al-Halawany, Amina Sedky; Antonios, Manal Abdelmalik; Newegy, Reem Gamal","journal":"Indian J Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4994124.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4994124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Iatrogenic"],"organizations":["MV","Alexandria University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ventilated patients","risk of pneumothorax","Iatrogenic pneumothorax","episodes of pneumothorax","Alexandria University PICU patients","higher pediatric index of mortality","higher need","higher mortality rate","year study","longer duration of MV care","higher pediatric logistic organ dysfunction score","Case notes","admission","common tool","common causes of IP","cases","OBJECTIVE","Pediatric Intensive Care Unit","high index of suspicion","high-frequency oscillatory ventilation settings","mechanical ventilation","year period","longer length of stay","barotrauma secondary","strict application of protective lung strategies","chest X-ray","central vein catheter insertion","prompt recognition","diagnosis","importance","METHODS","medical emergency","DESIGN","lower body weight","clinical examination","intervention","SUBJECTS","RESULTS","younger age","CONCLUSIONS","counterpart"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate and evaluate the public reaction to Ebola in China and identify the primitive correlation between possible influence factors caused by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and Chinese public attention via Internet surveillance. Methods: Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Micro Index (SMI) were collected from their official websites, and the disease-related data were recorded from the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and U.S. National Ministries of Health. The average BDI of Internet users in different regions were calculated to identify the public reaction to the Ebola outbreak. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation was used to check the relationship of epidemic trends with BDI and SMI. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis and autocorrelation analysis were performed to detect the clustered areas with the high attention to the topic of \u201CEbola\u201D. The related news reports were collected from authoritative websites to identify potential patterns. Results: The BDI and the SMI for \u201CEbola\u201D showed a similar fluctuating trend with a correlation coefficient = 0.9 (p \u003C 0.05). The average BDI in Beijing, Tibet, and Shanghai was higher than other cities. However, the disease-related indicators did not identify potential correlation with both indices above. A hotspot area was detected in Tibet by local autocorrelation analysis. The most likely cluster identified by spatiotemporal cluster analysis was in the northeast regions of China with the relative risk (RR) of 2.26 (p \u2264 0.01) from 30 July to 14 August in 2014. Qualitative analysis indicated that negative news could lead to a continuous increase of the public\u2019s attention until the appearance of a positive news report.

Small DNA viruses mutate orders of magnitude faster than their hosts despite using host-encoded polymerases for replication, which suggests these viruses may avoid post-replicative repair. Supporting this, the genome of bacteriophage \u03D5X174 is completely devoid of GATC sequence motifs, which are required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that restoration of the randomly expected number of GATC sites leads to an eightfold reduction in the rate of spontaneous mutation of the phage, without severely impairing its replicative capacity over the short term. However, the efficacy of mismatch repair in the presence of GATC sites is limited by inefficient methylation of the viral DNA. Therefore, both GATC avoidance and DNA under-methylation elevate the mutation rate of the phage relative to that of the host. We also found that the effects of GATC sites on the phage mutation rate vary extensively depending on their specific location within the phage genome. Finally, the mutation rate reduction afforded by GATC sites is fully reverted under stress conditions, which up-regulate repair pathways and expression of error-prone host polymerases such as heat and treatment with the base analog 5-fluorouracil, suggesting that access to repair renders the phage sensitive to stress-induced mutagenesis.","publish_time":"2015-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira-G\u00F3mez, Marianoel; Sanju\u00E1n, Rafael","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1fb56142974ef2ac7aaf635398b7f0382ab9645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5014478.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GATC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phage mutation rate","presence of GATC sites","effects of GATC sites","mutation rate reduction","GATC avoidance","phage genome","rate of spontaneous mutation","expected number of GATC sites","phage sensitive","phage relative","repair pathways","efficacy of mismatch repair","post-replicative repair","Viral mutation rates","viral DNA","devoid of GATC sequence motifs","DNA under-methylation","prone host polymerases","Small DNA viruses","host-encoded polymerases","inefficient methylation","eightfold reduction","stress conditions","replicative capacity","stress-induced mutagenesis","genome of bacteriophage \u03D5X174","expression of error","hosts","orders of magnitude","nature","evolutionary determinants","variability","fluorouracil","treatment","replication","access","Escherichia coli","specific location","base analog","short term","restoration"],"language":"en"},

Natural RSV infection stimulates the Th1 immune response and activates the production of neutralizing antibodies, while earlier vaccine trials that used UV-inactivated RSV exacerbated the disease due to the activation of the allergic Th2 response. With a focus on Th1 immunity, we developed a DNA vaccine containing the native RSV fusion (RSV F) protein and studied its immune response in BALB/c mice. High levels of RSV specific antibodies were induced during subsequent immunizations. The serum antibodies were able to neutralize RSV in vitro. The RSV inhibition by sera was also shown by immunofluorescence analyses. Antibody response of the RSV F DNA vaccine showed a strong Th1 response. Also, sera from RSV F immunized and RSV infected mice reduced the RSV infection by 50% and 80%, respectively.

The AP2 gene is functional and necessary for flower development, stem cell maintenance, and seed development, whereas the other members of AP2 group redundantly affect flowering time. Here we study the phylogeny of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes. Spermatophyte AP2 group genes can be classified into AP2 and TOE types, six clades, and we found that the AP2 group homologs in gymnosperms belong to the AP2 type, whereas TOE types are absent, which indicates the AP2 type gene are more ancient and TOE type was split out of AP2 type and losing the major function. In Brassicaceae, the expansion of AP2 and TOE type lead to the gene number of AP2 group were up to six. Purifying selection appears to have been the primary driving force of spermatophyte AP2 group evolution, although positive selection occurred in the AP2 clade. The transition from exon to intron of AtAP2 in Arabidopsis mutant leads to the loss of gene function and the same situation was found in AtTOE2. Combining this evolutionary analysis and published research, the results suggest that typical AP2 group genes may first appear in gymnosperms and diverged in angiosperms, following expansion of group members and functional differentiation. In angiosperms, AP2 genes (AP2 clade) inherited key functions from ancestors and other genes of AP2 group lost most function but just remained flowering time controlling in gene formation. In this study, the phylogenies of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes was analyzed, which supported the evidence for the research of gene functional evolution of AP2 group.","publish_time":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Pengkai; Cheng, Tielong; Lu, Mengzhu; Liu, Guangxin; Li, Meiping; Shi, Jisen; Lu, Ye; Laux, Thomas; Chen, Jinhui","journal":"Front Plant Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37f723594fc45504f7f8d4fc7ca0190513a639c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5029118.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5029118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzExMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AP2 genes","genes of AP2 group","members of AP2 group","AP2 group homologs","expansion of AP2","AP2 clade","AP2 type gene","Spermatophyte AP2 group genes","typical AP2 group genes","phylogenies of AP2 group genes","phylogeny of AP2 group genes","gene number of AP2 group","research of gene functional evolution of AP2 group","primary driving force of spermatophyte AP2 group evolution","expansion of group members","large group of DNA","gene formation","TOE type lead","loss of gene function","TOE types","functional differentiation","angiosperms","spermatophytes","gymnosperms","major function","flowering time","study","flower development","seed development","published research","positive selection","stem cell maintenance","results","Arabidopsis mutant leads","intron of AtAP2","binding proteins","ancestors","key functions","exon","evolutionary analysis","transition","EREBP","situation","evidence","clades","Brassicaceae","APETALA2","AtTOE2"],"language":"en"},

This study was carried out to give a bibliometric overview of literature on carbapenem resistance. In specific, number of publications, top productive countries and institutes, highly cited articles, citation analysis, co-authorships, international collaboration, top active authors, and journals publishing articles on carbapenem resistance were analyzed and discussed. METHODS: Specific keywords pertaining to carbapenem resistance were used in Scopus database. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of retrieved data were presented using appropriate bibliometric indicators and visualization maps. RESULTS: A total of 2617 journal articles were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was of 21.47. The growth of publications showed a dramatic increase from 2008 to 2015. Approximately 9 % of retrieved articles on carbapenem resistance were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal. Retrieved articles were published by 102 different countries. The United States of America (USA) contributed most with 437 (16.70 %) articles followed by China with 257 (9.82 %) articles. When productivity was stratified by population size, Greece ranked first followed by France. Greece also ranked first when data were stratified by gross domestic product (GDP). Asian countries have lesser international collaboration compared with other countries in the top ten list. Five of top ten productive institutes were Europeans (France, the UK, Greece, Italy, and Switzerland) and two were Asians (China and South Korea). Other active institutes included an Israeli and a Brazilian institute. Four of the top ten cited articles were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal and two were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. CONCLUSION: There was a dramatic increase in number of publications on carbapenem resistance in the past few years. These publications were produced from different world regions including Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Latin America. International collaboration needs to be encouraged particularly for researchers in Asia. Molecular biology and epidemiology dominated the theme of the top ten cited articles on carbapenem resistance. This bibliometric study will hopefully help health policy makers in planning future research and allocating funds pertaining to carbapenem resistance.","publish_time":"2016-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sweileh, Waleed M.; Shraim, Naser Y.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.; Sawalha, Ansam F.; AbuTaha, Adham S.; Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a293d2836c440402c8f71b2785b853473d188f5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal","UK"],"locations":["United States of America","China","France","Asia","Europe","Greece","Switzerland","South Korea","Middle East","Latin America"],"keyphrases":["carbapenem resistance","retrieved articles","Antimicrobial resistance","cited articles","journal articles","number of publications","productive countries","different countries","Greece","Antimicrobial Agents","active institutes","growth of publications","productive institutes","Asian countries","bibliometric study","Chemotherapy journal","lesser international collaboration","qualitative analysis of retrieved data","dramatic increase","France","China","global public health challenge","urgent global health threat","health policy makers","appropriate bibliometric indicators","bibliometric overview of literature","average number of citations","citation analysis","active authors","Latin America","Specific keywords","different world regions","United States of America","co-authorships","planning future research","Middle East","theme","funds","journals","Asians","gross domestic product","visualization maps","UK","Israeli","Europeans","past","Molecular biology","epidemiology","GDP","USA","South Korea","population size","Switzerland","Italy","METHODS","total","Scopus database","BACKGROUND","years","Brazilian institute","Lancet Infectious Diseases","productivity","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","researchers","list"],"language":"en"},

One such antigen, the hemoglobin-digesting intestinal aspartic protease known as Na-APR-1 from the human hookworm Necator americanus, is currently a lead candidate antigen in clinical trials, as is Na-GST-1 a heme-detoxifying glutathione S-transferase. METHODS: In order to discover additional hookworm vaccine antigens, messenger RNA was obtained from the intestine of male hookworms, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, maintained in hamsters. RNA-seq was performed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The genes expressed in the hookworm intestine were compared with those expressed in the whole worm and those genes overexpressed in the parasite intestine transcriptome were further analyzed. RESULTS: Among the lead transcripts identified were genes encoding for proteolytic enzymes including an A. ceylanicum APR-1, but the most common proteases were cysteine-, serine-, and metallo-proteases. Also in abundance were specific transporters of key breakdown metabolites, including amino acids, glucose, lipids, ions and water; detoxifying and heme-binding glutathione S-transferases; a family of cysteine-rich/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) previously found in high abundance in parasitic nematodes; C-type lectins; and heat shock proteins. These candidates will be ranked for downstream antigen target selection based on key criteria including abundance, uniqueness in the parasite versus the vertebrate host, as well as solubility and yield of expression. CONCLUSION: The intestinal transcriptome of A. ceylanicum provides useful information for the identification of proteins involved in the blood-feeding process, representing a first step towards a reverse vaccinology approach to a human hookworm vaccine.

Convalescent serum and blood were used to treat patients during outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infection in 1976 and 1995, with inconclusive results. During the recent 2013\u20132016 West African epidemic, serum/plasma from survivors of ZEBOV infection was used to treat patients in the affected countries and several repatriated patients. The effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown. Methods. Nine rhesus monkeys were experimentally infected with ZEBOV-Makona. Beginning on day 3 after exposure (at the onset of viremia), 4 animals were treated with homologous ZEBOV-Makona convalescent macaque sera, 3 animals were treated in parallel with heterologous Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) convalescent macaque sera, and 2 animals served as positive controls and were not treated.

Knowledge about the pathways and mechanisms of transmission from animals to humans is limited; as of yet, transmission risks have not been quantified. Moreover the divergent sanitary situations and exposures to animals among populations in the Arabian Peninsula, where human primary cases appear to dominate, vs. other regions in the Middle East and Africa, with no reported human clinical cases and where the virus has been detected only in dromedaries, represents huge scientific and health challenges. Here, we have used expert-opinion elicitation in order to obtain ideas on relative importance of MERS-CoV risk factors and estimates of transmission risks from various types of contact between humans and dromedaries. Fourteen experts with diverse and extensive experience in MERS-CoV relevant fields were enrolled and completed an online questionnaire that examined pathways based on several scenarios, e.g., camels\u2013camels, camels\u2013human, bats/other species to camels/humans, and the role of diverse biological substances (milk, urine, etc.) and potential fomites. Experts believed that dromedary camels play the largest role in MERS-CoV infection of other dromedaries; however, they also indicated a significant influence of the season (i.e. calving or weaning periods) on transmission risk. All experts thought that MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries and asymptomatic humans play the most important role in infection of humans, with bats and other species presenting a possible, but yet undefined, risk. Direct and indirect contact of humans with dromedary camels were identified as the most risky types of contact, when compared to consumption of various camel products, with estimated \u201Cmost likely\u201D incidence risks of at least 22 and 13% for direct and indirect contact, respectively. The results of our study are consistent with available, yet very limited, published data regarding the potential pathways of transmission of MERS-CoV at the animal\u2013human interface. These results identify key knowledge gaps and highlight the need for more comprehensive, yet focused research to be conducted to better understand transmission between dromedaries and humans.","publish_time":"2016-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Funk, Anna L.; Goutard, Flavie Luce; Miguel, Eve; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Chevalier, Veronique; Faye, Bernard; Peiris, J.

First, we use data and models of West African migration to show that EVD does not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD within country administrative divisions and find that it significantly decreases with population density. Finally, we test whether EVD strains have uniform transmissibility through a novel statistical test, and find that certain strains appear more often than expected by chance.","publish_time":"2016-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burghardt, Keith; Verzijl, Christopher; Huang, Junming; Ingram, Matthew; Song, Binyang; Hasne, Marie-Pierre","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aefef1323fca13785229bd8cb1f9fcb4873a76b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5056384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5056384/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola Virus Disease","EVD"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["EVD strains","disease spreads","uniform transmissibility","Recent models of Ebola Virus Disease","assumptions","initial growth rate of EVD","disease model accuracy","novel statistical test","models of West African migration","certain strains","population density","country administrative divisions","simple solutions","data","homogeneous mixing","predictable manner","paper","people","chance"],"language":"en"},

Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. OBJECTIVES: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). Sequencing data of 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT\u2010PCR\u2010positive specimens were analysed. RESULTS: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real\u2010time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV\u2010positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species. Eighty per cent (16/20) of sequences that grouped as HRV C in the VP4/VP2 tree clustered as HRV A, alongside some previously described C strains as subspecies C/A. Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5\u2032UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9% vs 25.5%, P = .032). CONCLUSION: Human rhinoviruses are a common cause of respiratory infections, and HRV C is present in the Southern Hemisphere. Sequencing of multiple HRV regions may be necessary to determine exact phylogenetic relationships.","publish_time":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ratnamohan, Vigneswary M.; Zeng, Frank; Donovan, Linda; MacIntyre, Chandini R.; Kok, Jen; Dwyer, Dominic E.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6515195e0fdd7f1fb437a01b8737685d6d92765.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5059946.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","HRV"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["HRV C species","prevalence of HRV C","grouping of HRV","different HRV","genotypes of HRV","subspecies C","Sequencing of multiple HRV regions","VP4","described C strains","VP2 tree","UTR tree","Human rhinoviruses","B species","real\u2010time PCR","positive samples","VP2 coding regions","RT","ILI","clinical samples","sequences","Sequencing data","Southern Hemisphere","real\u2010time reverse","common cause of respiratory infections","positive specimens","Phylogenetic analysis","severe respiratory infection","exact phylogenetic relationships","Molecular epidemiological data","transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","throat swabs","nasopharyngeal aspirates","Combined nose","illness","individuals","identity","Discordant branching","adult patients","METHODS","mild influenza","Sydney","wide spectrum of disease","vs","Australia","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","genes","cent","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death contributes to pathology and decreases in survival time in sepsis models. Priming of the host cell, through TLR4 and interferon receptors, induces caspase-11 expression, and cytosolic LPS directly stimulates caspase-11 activation, promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines through pyroptosis and caspase-1 activation. Using a CRISPR-Cas9\u2013mediated genome-wide screen, we identified novel mediators of caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death. We found a complement-related peptidase, carboxypeptidase B1 (Cpb1), to be required for caspase-11 gene expression and subsequent caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death. Cpb1 modifies a cleavage product of C3, which binds to and activates C3aR, and then modulates innate immune signaling. We find the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway induces caspase-11 expression through amplification of MAPK activity downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar activation, and mediates severity of LPS-induced sepsis (endotoxemia) and disease outcome in mice. We show C3aR is required for up-regulation of caspase-11 orthologues, caspase-4 and -5, in primary human macrophages during inflammation and that c3aR1 and caspase-5 transcripts are highly expressed in patients with severe sepsis; thus, suggesting that these pathways are important in human sepsis.

It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People\u2019s day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector\u2013host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector\u2013host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector\u2013host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector\u2013host ratio and people\u2019s day-to-day movement patterns.

These genes are critical for resistance and susceptibility to diseases, and host\u2013pathogen interactions are major determinants of their extensive polymorphism. Here we examined spatial patterns of diversity of the expressed MHC class II DRB gene of three sympatric Neotropical bats, Carollia perspicillata and Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae), and Molossus molossus (Molossidae), all of which use the same environments (e.g., forests, edge habitats, urban areas). Comparison with neutral marker (mtDNA D-loop) diversity was performed at the same time. RESULTS: Twenty-three DRB alleles were identified in 19 C. perspicillata, 30 alleles in 35 D. rotundus and 20 alleles in 28 M. molossus. The occurrence of multiple DRB loci was found for the two Phyllostomidae species. The DRB polymorphism was high in all sampling sites and different signatures of positive selection were detected depending on the environment. The patterns of DRB diversity were similar to those of neutral markers for C. perspicillata and M. molossus. In contrast, these patterns were different for D. rotundus for which a geographical structure was highlighted. A heterozygote advantage was also identified for this species. No recombination or gene conversion event was found and phylogenetic relationships showed a trans-species mode of evolution in the Phyllostomids. CONCLUSIONS: This study of MHC diversity demonstrated the strength of the environment and contrasting pathogen pressures in shaping DRB diversity. Differences between positively selected sites identified in bat species highlighted the potential role of gut microbiota in shaping immune responses. Furthermore, multiple geographic origins and/or population admixtures observed in C. perspicillata and M. molossus populations acted as an additional force in shaping DRB diversity. In contrast, DRB diversity of D. rotundus was shaped by environment rather than demographic history.

Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment have been shown to improve the prognosis of VAP. Chest X-ray or computed tomography imaging are used for conventional assessment of VAP, but these methods are impractical for real-time measurement in critical patients. Therefore, lung ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used for the assessment of VAP in the ICU. Traditionally, LUS has seemed unsuitable for the detection of lung parenchyma owing to the high acoustic impedance of air; however, the fact that the reflection and reverberation in the detection region of the ultrasound reflect the underlying pathology of lung diseases has led to the increased use of ultrasound imaging as a standard of care supported by evidence-based and expert consensus in the ICU. Considering that any type of pneumonia causes air volume changes in the lungs, accumulating evidence has shown that LUS effectively measures the presence of VAP as well as dynamic changes in VAP. This review offers evidence for ultrasound as a noninvasive, easily repeatable, and bedside means to assess VAP; in addition, it establishes a protocol for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of VAP.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) leads to significant economic losses due to hide damage, reduction of milk production, mastitis, infertility and mortalities (10 %). Early detection of the virus is crucial to start appropriate outbreak control measures. Veterinarians rely on the presence of the characteristic clinical signs of LSD. Laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed at well-equipped laboratories. In this study, a portable, simple, and rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the detection of LSDV-genome for the use on farms was developed. RESULTS: The LSDV RPA assay was performed at 42 \u00B0C and detected down to 179 DNA copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 min. Unspecific amplification was observed with neither LSDV-negative samples (n = 12) nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, Peste des petits ruminants and Blue tongue virus (serotypes 1, 6 and 8). The clinical sensitivity of the LSDV RPA assay matched 100 % (n = 22) to real-time PCR results. In addition, the LSDV RPA assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses. CONCLUSION: The LSDV RPA assay is a rapid and sensitive test that could be implemented in field or at quarantine stations for the identification of LSDV infected case.

In this study four functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, H/L, X/Y, P/Q and A/B) across the MBL2 gene were genotyped by direct DNA sequencing of PCR products in a case-control population of Chinese Han origin, consisting of 1,020 patients with pulmonary TB and 1,020 controls. We found that individuals carrying variant allele at A/B (namely BB or AB genotypes) was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (odds ratios [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30\u20131.91, P = 1.3 \u00D7 10(\u22126)). Additionally, LYPB haplotype showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.27\u20131.87, P = 4.2 \u00D7 10(\u22126); global haplotype association P = 3.5 \u00D7 10(\u22125)). Furthermore, individuals bearing low- or medium- MBL expression haplotype pairs had an increased risk of TB (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.29\u20131.90, P = 1.4 \u00D7 10(\u22126)). Thus, the reduced expression of functional MBL secondary to having MBL2 variants may partially mediate the increased susceptibility to TB risk.","publish_time":"2016-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Cheng; He, Tao; Rong, Yanxiao; Du, Fengjiao; Ma, Dongxing; Wei, Yujie; Mei, Zhiqin; Wang, Yuling; Wang, Haibin; Zhu, Yuehua; Zhang, Zongde; Zheng, Li; Wu, Xueqiong; Liu, Huiliang; Ding, Wenjun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1621345a6fa32695580f1455de8a7f6284a0f9e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5095599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AB","LYPB","MBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB risk","increased risk of TB","pulmonary TB","risk of developing TB","increased susceptibility","global haplotype association P","MBL2 polymorphisms","MBL2 variants","significant association","MBL2 gene","LYPB haplotype","individuals","medium- MBL expression haplotype pairs","reduced expression of functional MBL secondary","functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms","infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","important determinant","direct DNA sequencing of PCR products","case-control population of Chinese Han origin","SNPs","patients","AB genotypes","Host genetic variability","study","various populations","odds ratios","results","BB","variant allele","controls","humans","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We measured the expression levels of MAN1A1, MAN1A2, MAN1B1, and MAN1C1 in cell lines HepG2.2.15, HepN10, HepAD38 and HepG2 by Western blot. Viral antigens (HBsAg and HBeAg) in the culture medium were measured using the chemiluminescence method. HBV DNA quantification assays were performed using a commercial real-time PCR kit. Protein levels of human liver tissue \u03B1-1,2-mannosidases were also evaluated by Western blot. Plasmids containing seven individual viral genes of HBV (PTT22-HBx, PTT22-HBs, PTT22-preS2, PTT22-preS1, PTT22-HBc, PTT22-HBe, and PTT22-HBp) or control plasmids (PTT22-vector) were transfected into HepG2 cells. MK886 (PPAR\u03B1) and GW9662 (PPAR\u03B3) inhibitors were used to explore the effects of HBV on \u03B1-1,2-mannosidase expression after the PPAR\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B3 pathways were blocked. RESULTS: We showed that the expression of \u03B1-1,2-mannosidases was higher in stably transfected HBV cells than in controls. The expression levels of \u03B1-1,2-mannosidase were higher in AD38 cells than those in ND10 cells, which were in turn greater than those in G2.2.15 cells, and positively correlated with the expression of HBsAg in all the cell lines. Levels of \u03B1-1,2-mannosidase in non-tumorous liver tissues of HBV-related HCC patients were also higher than in the tissues from non-HBV-related HCC patients. Moreover, transfecting HepG2 cells with a component of the HBV viral envelope also increased the expression of \u03B1-1,2-mannosidases. However, this envelope protein component could not induce MAN1C1 expression in the presence of a PPAR\u03B1 inhibitor, MK886. We also found that MK886 did not affect the expression of MAN1C1 in AD38 cells without tetracycline in the culture medium. This phenomenon was not observed in the case of GW9662. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that HBV increases the expression of \u03B1-mannosidases both in vitro and in vivo via activation of the PPAR\u03B1 pathway by its envelope protein.","publish_time":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Song; Jiang, Li-Bin; Zou, Xiao-Jing; Yi, Wei; Tian, De-Ying","journal":"World J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f318f417880d9beb2ce5c8444f3597a8808eae30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5116597.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5116597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of \u03B1","expression levels of \u03B1","mannosidase expression","MAN1C1 expression","expression of MAN1C1","expression of host \u03B1","transfected HBV cells","expression of HBsAg","effects of HBV","HBV viral envelope","expression levels of MAN1A1","mannosidases","PTT22-preS1","PTT22-preS2","PTT22-HBs","PTT22-HBx","PTT22-HBp","PTT22-HBe","PTT22-HBc","PTT22-vector","AD38 cells","ND10 cells","transfecting HepG2 cells","individual viral genes of HBV","non-HBV-related HCC patients","non-tumorous liver tissues of HBV","Protein levels of human liver tissue \u03B1","HBV DNA quantification assays","MK886","envelope protein component","cell lines HepG2","PPAR\u03B1 pathway","PPAR\u03B1 inhibitor","culture medium","Viral antigens","Western blot","RESULTS","control plasmids","PPAR\u03B3 pathways","case of GW9662","effects of hepatitis B virus","MAN1B1","HepN10","HBeAg","HepAD38","MAN1A2","tetracycline","presence","commercial real-time PCR kit","inhibitors","activation","controls","chemiluminescence method","underlying mechanisms","CONCLUSION","METHODS","phenomenon","AIM"],"language":"en"},

A range of compounds currently available with broad antimicrobial activity have been tested for activity against EBOV. Using live EBOV, eighteen candidate compounds were screened for antiviral activity in vitro. The compounds were selected on a rational basis because their mechanisms of action suggested that they had the potential to disrupt EBOV entry, replication or exit from cells or because they had displayed some antiviral activity against EBOV in previous tests. Nine compounds caused no reduction in viral replication despite cells remaining healthy, so they were excluded from further analysis (zidovudine; didanosine; stavudine; abacavir sulphate; entecavir; JB1a; Aimspro; celgosivir; and castanospermine). A second screen of the remaining compounds and the feasibility of appropriateness for in vivo testing removed six further compounds (ouabain; omeprazole; esomeprazole; Gleevec; D-LANA-14; and Tasigna). The three most promising compounds (17-DMAG; BGB324; and NCK-8) were further screened for in vivo activity in the guinea pig model of EBOV disease. Two of the compounds, BGB324 and NCK-8, showed some effect against lethal infection in vivo at the concentrations tested, which warrants further investigation. Further, these data add to the body of knowledge on the antiviral activities of multiple compounds against EBOV and indicate that the scientific community should invest more effort into the development of novel and specific antiviral compounds to treat Ebola virus disease.","publish_time":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dowall, Stuart D.; Bewley, Kevin; Watson, Robert J.; Vasan, Seshadri S.; Ghosh, Chandradhish; Konai, Mohini M.; Gausdal, Gro; Lorens, James B.; Long, Jason; Barclay, Wendy; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Hiscox, Julian; Bosworth, Andrew; Taylor, Irene; Easterbrook, Linda; Pitman, James; Summers, Sian; Chan-Pensley, Jenny; Funnell, Simon; Vipond, Julia; Charlton, Sue; Haldar, Jayanta; Hewson, Roger; Carroll, Miles W.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38b50147abf86a5818c6bb5e09b1f07edf51352b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5127007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["remaining compounds","candidate compounds","range of compounds","promising compounds","specific antiviral compounds","antiviral activity","antiviral activities of multiple compounds","EBOV entry","live EBOV","guinea pig model of EBOV disease","Ebola virus disease","effective antiviral countermeasures","broad antimicrobial activity","cells","NCK","BGB324","recent outbreak of Ebola virus","viral replication","stavudine","entecavir","abacavir sulphate","esomeprazole","Aimspro","didanosine","Gleevec","JB1a","renewed efforts","ouabain","West Africa","development of novel","body of knowledge","celgosivir","D-LANA","zidovudine","rational basis","testing","potential","feasibility of appropriateness","DMAG","reduction","previous tests","mechanisms of action","concentrations","lethal infection","analysis","light","scientific community","castanospermine","data","screen","investigation","Tasigna"],"language":"en"},

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and incidence of viral genome detection by qPCR in the equine airways, and their association with respiratory clinical signs. METHODS: Both NS and tracheal washes (TW) were collected monthly on 52 Standardbred racehorses at training, over 27 consecutive months (581 samples). Equid herpesviruses (EHV)-1, \u22124, \u22122 and \u22125, equine rhinitis virus-A and -B (ERBV), equine adenovirus-1 and \u22122, equine coronavirus and equine influenza virus were systematically investigated in both NS and TW. Nasal discharge, coughing, tracheal mucus score and TW neutrophil proportions were simultaneously recorded. RESULTS: Genome for 7/10 viruses were detected at least once throughout the study; up to 4 different viruses being also concomitantly detected. Monthly incidence in TW was respectively 27.9% (EHV-5), 24.8% (EHV-2), 7.1% (ERBV), 3.8% (EHV-4), 1.9% (EAdV1) and 0.2% (EHV-1; ERAV). Neither agreement nor correlation between NS and TW was found for respectively genome detection and viral loads. Detection of viral genome in NS was not associated with any clinical sign. Coughing was significantly associated with TW detection of EHV-2 DNA (OR 3.1; P = 0.01) and ERBV RNA (OR 5.3; P \u003C 0.001). Detection of EHV-2 DNA in TW was also significantly associated with excess tracheal mucus (OR 2.1; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Detection and quantification of EHV-2 and ERBV by qPCR in TW, but not in NS, should be considered when investigating horses with IAD.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of lung responses in mice exposed to six individual TiO(2)NPs exhibiting different sizes (8, 20 and 300nm), crystalline structure (anatase, rutile or anatase/rutile) and surface modifications (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) to investigate whether the mechanisms leading to TiO(2)NP-induced lung inflammation are property specific. A detailed histopathological analysis was conducted to investigate the long-term disease implications of acute exposure to TiO(2)NPs. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 18, 54, 162 or 486 \u00B5g of TiO(2)NPs/mouse via single intratracheal instillation. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium only. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were sampled on 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Although all TiO(2)NPs induced lung inflammation as measured by the neutrophil influx in BALF, rutile-type TiO(2)NPs induced higher inflammation with the hydrophilic rutile TiO(2)NP showing the maximum increase. Accordingly, the rutile TiO(2)NPs induced higher number of differentially expressed genes. Histopathological analysis of lung sections on Day 90 post-exposure showed increased collagen staining and fibrosis-like changes following exposure to the rutile TiO(2)NPs at the highest dose tested. Among the anatase, the smallest TiO(2)NP of 8nm showed the maximum response. The anatase TiO(2)NP of 300nm was the least responsive of all. The results suggest that the severity of lung inflammation is property specific; however, the underlying mechanisms (genes and pathways perturbed) leading to inflammation were the same for all particle types. While the particle size clearly influenced the overall acute lung responses, a combination of small size, crystalline structure and hydrophilic surface contributed to the long-term pathological effects observed at the highest dose (486 \u00B5g/mouse). Although the dose at which the pathological changes were observed is considered physiologically high, the study highlights the disease potential of certain TiO(2)NPs of specific properties.","publish_time":"2016-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahman, Luna; Wu, Dongmei; Johnston, Michael; William, Andrew; Halappanavar, Sabina","journal":"Mutagenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72e25d8530d2d778392e2ca2a1ec1b7e13e24a30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5180171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5180171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anatase TiO","\u00B5g of TiO","hydrophilic rutile TiO","individual TiO","smallest TiO","rutile-type TiO","NP-induced lung inflammation","severity of lung inflammation","lung tissue","NPs of specific properties","disease potential of certain TiO","higher inflammation","Histopathological analysis of lung sections","overall acute lung responses","comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of lung responses","nm","hydrophilic surface","property specific","highest dose","days post-exposure","long-term disease implications of acute exposure","crystalline structure","BALF","pathological changes","particle size","mouse","mice","detailed histopathological analysis","study","genes","long-term pathological effects","surface modifications","higher number","underlying mechanisms","maximum response","maximum increase","particle types","combination of small size","increased collagen staining","fibrosis","neutrophil influx","Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","single intratracheal instillation","pathways","different sizes","experimental animals","Titanium dioxide nanoparticles","Controls","dispersion medium","results","C57BL"],"language":"en"},

The clinical and laboratory surveillance data for influenza have been used to construct critical indicators for influenza activities in the community, and previous studies have reported varying degrees of association between laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens and outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in subtropical cities. However, few studies have reported on this issue for cities in temperate regions, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, the mechanism behind age-specific seasonal epidemics remains unresolved, although it has been widely discussed. We utilized a wavelet analysis method to monitor the coherence of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens with the weekly outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in Beijing, China. We first examined the seasonal pattern of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtyped into seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and pandemic virus A(H1N1) pdm09) and influenza B separately within the period from 2008\u20132015; then, we detected the coherence of clinical and laboratory surveillance data in this district, specially examining weekly time series of age-specific epidemics of influenza-like illnesses in the whole study period for three age categories (age 0\u20135, 5\u201315 and 25\u201360). We found that influenza A and B were both active in winter but were not always seasonally synchronous in Beijing. Synchronization between age ranges was found in most epidemic peaks from 2008\u20132015. Our findings suggested that peaks of influenza-like illness in individuals aged 0\u20135 and 5\u201315 years consistently appeared ahead of those of adults, implying the possibility that schoolchildren may lead epidemic fluctuations.","publish_time":"2016-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Zhenyu; Sun, Xiaoyu; Chu, Yanhui; Sun, Jingyi; Qin, Guoyou; Yang, Lin; Qin, Jingning; Xiao, Zheng; Ren, Jian; Qin, Di; Wang, Xiling; Zheng, Xueying","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f52f6ec3e15cc1cc45803c3cb81618d5ee82b7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5201231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5201231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["influenza specimens","influenza B","peaks of influenza","influenza activities","cases of influenza","specific epidemics of influenza","weekly outpatient consultation rates of influenza","laboratory surveillance data","age-specific seasonal epidemics","age ranges","age categories","seasonal pattern of laboratory","coherence of weekly percentage of laboratory","weekly time series of age","coherence of clinical","H1N1","winter","city of Beijing","epidemic peaks","temperate regions","previous studies","study period","epidemic fluctuations","subtropical cities","typical temperate climate","district","varying degrees of association","community","pdm09","illnesses","clear distinct seasons","possibility","schoolchildren","pandemic virus","issue","spring","critical indicators","mechanism","wavelet analysis method","H3N2","developing countries","adults","Synchronization","China","findings","individuals","years"],"language":"en"},

The regulatory mechanism by which HBoV RNA transcripts are polyadenylated at proximal [(pA)p] or distal [(pA)d] polyadenylation sites is still unclear. We constructed a recombinant HBoV infectious clone to study the alternative polyadenylation regulation of HBoV. Surprisingly, in addition to the reported distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, a novel distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, which is located in the right-end hairpin (REH), was identified during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. (pA)d2 does not contain typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal, upstream elements (USE), or downstream elements (DSE) according to sequence analysis. Further study showed that HBoV nonstructural protein NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d were necessary and sufficient for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. The distance and sequences between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also played a key role in the regulation of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Finally, we demonstrated that efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2 resulted in increased HBoV capsid mRNA transcripts and protein translation. Thus, our study revealed that all the bocaviruses have distal poly(A) signals on the right-end palindromic terminus, and alternative polyadenylation at the HBoV 3\u2032 end regulates its capsid expression. IMPORTANCE The distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, of HBoV is located about 400 nucleotides (nt) from the right-end palindromic terminus, which is different from those of bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (MVC) in the same genus whose distal polyadenylation is located in the right-end stem-loop structure. A novel polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, was identified in the right-end hairpin of HBoV during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. Sequence analysis showed that (pA)d2 does not contain typical polyadenylation signals, and the last 42 nt form a stem-loop structure which is almost identical to that of MVC. Further study showed that NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid expression. Our study demonstrates alternative polyadenylation at the 3\u2032 end of HBoV and suggests an additional mechanism by which capsid expression is regulated.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Sujuan; Zhang, Junmei; Chen, Zhen; Xu, Huanzhou; Wang, Hanzhong; Guan, Wuxiang","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d474315fbb8b2c284039f0caec40aaa334db068b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5244319.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5244319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["d2","efficient polyadenylation","regulation of polyadenylation","polyadenylation sites","end of HBoV","alternative polyadenylation regulation of HBoV","novel polyadenylation site","novel distal polyadenylation site","reported distal polyadenylation site","typical polyadenylation signals","right-end hairpin of HBoV","HBoV RNA transcripts","typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal","study","recombinant HBoV infectious clone","HBoV nonstructural protein NS1","increased HBoV capsid mRNA transcripts","right-end stem-loop structure","capsid expression","cis elements","REH","infectious clone transfection","recombinant virus infection","upstream elements","downstream elements","protein translation","palindromic terminus","MVC","sequence analysis","Alternative processing of human bocavirus","canine minute virus","additional mechanism","regulatory mechanism","P5 promoter-transcribed RNA","BPV","bovine parvovirus","key role","DSE","bocaviruses","sequences","nucleotides","genus","IMPORTANCE","distance"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the effects of respiratory viral infections in the absence of illness. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for common respiratory viruses and for two genes known to be highly upregulated in viral infections (CCL8/CXCL11), we screened 92 asthmatic and 69 healthy children without illness for respiratory virus infections. RESULTS: We found 21 viral qPCR-positive and 2 suspected virus-infected subjects with high expression of CCL8/CXCL11. We applied a dual RNA-seq workflow to these subjects, together with 25 viral qPCR-negative subjects, to compare qPCR with sequencing-based virus detection and to generate the airway transcriptome for analysis. RNA-seq virus detection achieved 86% sensitivity when compared to qPCR-based screening. We detected additional respiratory viruses in the two CCL8/CXCL11-high subjects and in two of the qPCR-negative subjects. Viral read counts varied widely and were used to stratify subjects into Virus-High and Virus-Low groups. Examination of the host airway transcriptome found that the Virus-High group was characterized by immune cell airway infiltration, downregulation of cilia genes, and dampening of type 2 inflammation. Even the Virus-Low group was differentiated from the No-Virus group by 100 genes, some involved in eIF2 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory virus infection without illness is not innocuous but may determine the airway function of these subjects by driving immune cell airway infiltration, cellular remodeling, and alteration of asthmogenic gene expression.

Influenza virus infections represent a serious public health and economic problem, which are most effectively prevented through vaccination. However, influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic variation, which requires either the annual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines or the rapid generation of vaccines against potential pandemic virus strains. The segmented nature of influenza virus allows for the reassortment between two or more viruses within a co-infected cell, and this characteristic has also been harnessed in the laboratory to generate reassortant viruses for their use as either inactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccines. With the implementation of plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques, it is now possible to engineer recombinant influenza viruses entirely from full-length complementary DNA copies of the viral genome by transfection of susceptible cells. These reverse genetics systems have provided investigators with novel and powerful approaches to answer important questions about the biology of influenza viruses, including the function of viral proteins, their interaction with cellular host factors and the mechanisms of influenza virus transmission and pathogenesis. In addition, reverse genetics techniques have allowed the generation of recombinant influenza viruses, providing a powerful technology to develop both inactivated and live-attenuated influenza vaccines. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of state-of-the-art, plasmid-based, influenza reverse genetics approaches and their implementation to provide rapid, convenient, safe and more effective influenza inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nogales, Aitor; Mart\u00EDnez-Sobrido, Luis","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b3de92b03457bddd57edad106262751d712c528.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5297655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5297655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective influenza","biology of influenza viruses","influenza reverse genetics","generation of recombinant influenza viruses","Influenza virus infections","live-attenuated influenza vaccines","mechanisms of influenza virus transmission","segmented nature of influenza virus","annual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines","reassortant viruses","live-attenuated vaccines","reverse genetics techniques","rapid generation of vaccines","reverse genetics systems","implementation of plasmid","powerful approaches","potential pandemic virus strains","annual seasonal epidemics","viral genome","powerful technology","function of viral proteins","full-length complementary DNA copies","serious public health","interaction","occasional pandemics of human respiratory disease","cellular host factors","novel","investigators","important questions","transfection of susceptible cells","continual antigenic variation","economic problem","co-infected cell","pathogenesis","current knowledge of state-of-the-art","characteristic","addition","reassortment","laboratory","review","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

However, whether TiO(2)(C) NPs exert antibacterial properties against Bacillus anthracis remains elusive. Here, we evaluated these VLRP NPs in the reduction of anthrax-induced pathogenesis. Bacteria-killing experiments indicated that a significantly higher proportion (40%\u201360%) of all tested Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis, were considerably eliminated by TiO(2)(C) NPs. Toxin inactivation analysis further suggested that the TiO(2)(C) NPs efficiently detoxify approximately 90% of tested anthrax lethal toxin, a major virulence factor of anthrax. Notably, macrophage clearance experiments further suggested that, even under suboptimal conditions without considerable bacterial killing, the TiO(2)(C) NP-mediated photocatalysis still exhibited antibacterial properties through the reduction of bacterial resistance against macrophage killing. Our results collectively suggested that TiO(2)(C) NP is a conceptually feasible anti-anthrax material, and the relevant technologies described herein may be useful in the development of new strategies against anthrax.","publish_time":"2016-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Der-Shan; Kau, Jyh-Hwa; Huang, Hsin-Hsien; Tseng, Yao-Hsuan; Wu, Wen-Shiang; Chang, Hsin-Hou","journal":"Nanomaterials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43918c75d7b7d3f9402b1342dfea1e19eb2bd909.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5302719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5302719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["applications of TiO","reduction of anthrax","antibacterial properties","VLRP NPs","tested anthrax lethal toxin","visible-light","major virulence factor of anthrax","feasible anti-anthrax material","ultraviolet light","Bacillus anthracis","visible light illumination","considerable bacterial killing","reduction of bacterial resistance","NP-mediated photocatalysis","tested Bacillus species","macrophage clearance experiments","Toxin inactivation analysis","subtilis","bactericidal activity of conventional titanium dioxide","relevant technologies","development of new strategies","suboptimal conditions","thuringiensis","irradiation","use","induced pathogenesis","living environments","cereus","higher proportion","nanoparticles","carbon","results"],"language":"en"},

Cell lines of human origin were tested for growth of Hom-1, and efficient replication was observed in HepG2, HuH7, and SK-CO15 cells. The three cell lines (of hepatic or intestinal origin) were confirmed to express hJAM1 on their surface, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated knockout of the hJAM1 gene in each line abolished Hom-1 propagation.

We showed that IGF-1R mRNA was up-regulated in Huh7 and Hep3B cells and human HCC tissues, and that IGF-1R knockdown by RNAi led to decreased proliferation, apoptosis induction, and decreased migration and invasion of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Further, the in vivo study indicated that IGF-1R knockdown markedly diminished the tumorigenesis and metastasis of Huh7 xenograft. Moreover, the intratumoral administration of lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA led to significant tumor growth inhibition in an established Huh7 xenograft model. Mechanistic investigations showed that midkine was found to be the most significantly down-regulated protein in Huh7 cells with IGF-1R knockdown, and ectopic overexpression of midkine significantly rescued inhibition of Huh7 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion caused by IGF-1R suppression.

After 21 or 40 days of diabetes onset, mouse serums and tissues were analyzed for ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities and protein expression. ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities were detected in different tissues. Their expressions vary depending on the studied tissue. Thus, whereas ACE activity was highly expressed in lungs, ACE2 activity was highly expressed in pancreas among the studied tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that diabetes up-regulates ACE mainly in serum, lung, heart, and liver, and ACE2 mainly in serum, liver, and pancreas. In conclusion, we found a marked serum and pulmonary alteration in ACE activity of diabetic mice, suggesting a common regulation. The increase of ACE2 activity within the circulation in diabetic mice may be ascribed to a compensatory mechanism of RAS.","publish_time":"2017-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roca-Ho, Heleia; Riera, Marta; Palau, Vanesa; Pascual, Julio; Soler, Maria Jose","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8da5d4c7d3f991b1538e839ed944dcd2167112d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5372579.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ACE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 activities","ACE activity of diabetic mice","ACE2 enzyme activities","increase of ACE2 activity","studied tissues","diabetic patients","different tissues","non-obese diabetic","mice model","marked serum","protein expression","liver","pancreas","local RAS","days of diabetes onset","compensatory mechanism of RAS","cardiovascular damage","cardiovascular pathologies","Renin angiotensin system","pulmonary alteration","chronic kidney disease progression","mouse serums","NOD","circulation","diseases","heart","lungs","study","common regulation","key role","expressions","sense","aim","conclusion","blockade"],"language":"en"},

The probability of these particles to deposit in the respiratory tract during breathing is essential for their toxic effects. Observations have shown that there is a substantial variability in deposition between subjects, not only due to respiratory diseases, but also among individuals with healthy lungs. The factors determining this variability are, however, not fully understood. METHOD: In this study we experimentally investigate factors that determine individual differences in the respiratory tract depositions of inhaled particles for healthy subjects at relaxed breathing. The study covers particles of diameters 15\u20135000 nm and includes 67 subjects aged 7\u201370 years. A comprehensive examination of lung function was performed for all subjects. Principal component analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between subject characteristics and particle deposition. RESULTS: A large individual variability in respiratory tract deposition efficiency was found. Individuals with high deposition of a certain particle size generally had high deposition for all particles \u003C3500 nm. The individual variability was explained by two factors: breathing pattern, and lung structural and functional properties. The most important predictors were found to be breathing frequency and anatomical airway dead space. We also present a linear regression model describing the deposition based on four variables: tidal volume, breathing frequency, anatomical dead space and resistance of the respiratory system (the latter measured with impulse oscillometry). CONCLUSIONS: To understand why some individuals are more susceptible to airborne particles we must understand, and take into account, the individual variability in the probability of particles to deposit in the respiratory tract by considering not only breathing patterns but also adequate measures of relevant structural and functional properties.

To date, in vitro toxic effects of AgNPs and ionic silver (Ag(\u002B)) on many somatic cell types are well established. However, no studies have been conducted hitherto to evaluate their effect on cellular transcriptome in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). RESULTS: The present study characterized transcriptomic changes induced by 5.0 \u00B5g/ml AgNPs during spontaneous differentiation of mouse ESCs, and compared them to those induced by Ag(\u002B) under identical conditions. After 24 h exposure, 101 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in AgNP-treated cells, whereas 400 genes responded to Ag(\u002B). Despite the large differences in the numbers of DEGs, functional annotation and pathway analysis of the regulated genes revealed overall similarities between AgNPs and Ag(\u002B). In both cases, most of the functions and pathways impacted fell into two major categories, embryonic development and metabolism. Nevertheless, a number of canonical pathways related to cancer were found for Ag(\u002B) but not for AgNPs. Conversely, it was noted that several members of the heat shock protein and the metallothionein families were upregulated by AgNPs but not Ag(\u002B), suggesting specific oxidative stress effect of AgNPs in ESCs. The effects of AgNPs on oxidative stress and downstream apoptosis were subsequently confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results presented in the current study demonstrate that both AgNPs and Ag(\u002B) caused transcriptomic changes that could potentially exert an adverse effect on development. Although transcriptomic responses to AgNPs and Ag(\u002B) were substantially similar, AgNPs exerted specific effects on ESCs due to their nanosized particulate form.

Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC(50), 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug\u2019s observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections.","publish_time":"2017-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Elizabeth A.; Dyall, Julie; Hoenen, Thomas; Barnes, Alyson B.; Zhou, Huanying; Liang, Janie Y.; Michelotti, Julia; Dewey, William H.; DeWald, Lisa Evans; Bennett, Richard S.; Morris, Patrick J.; Guha, Rajarshi; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; McKnight, Crystal; Chen, Yu-Chi; Xu, Xin; Wang, Amy; Hughes, Emma; Martin, Scott; Thomas, Craig; Jahrling, Peter B.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Olinger, Gene G.; White, Judith M.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9018234c987db8e1aec9ca3cae1806b75e4835ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5402990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5402990/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of apilimod","infection of EBOV","anti-EBOV action of apilimod","EBOV trafficking","apilimod blocks infections","trafficking of EBOV VLPs","similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein","entry inhibitor","PIKfyve inhibitor","antagonizing PIKfyve","unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition","Ebola virus","Marburg virus","endosome maturation","MARV","endolysosomes","filoviral infections","humans","cytoplasm","transcription-replication competent VLP infection","drug\u2019s observed anti-filoviral activity","early endosome antigen","bulk endosome acidification","primary mode of action","lipid kinase","reported tolerability","activity of cathepsins B","primary human macrophage cells","notable potency","Vero E6","particle","Niemann-Pick C1","NPC1","clinical trials","site of fusion","haploid genetic screen","positive endosomes","viral genome","release","intracellular receptor","macrophages","phase","therapeutic regimen","phosphate","evidence","cholesterol export","Phosphatidylinositol","nM"],"language":"en"},

This anti-tumor effect is most probably related to the inhibition of farnesyltransferase as indicated by molecular docking.

In species in which social status determines access to resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16S, 44 for eukaryote 18S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries\u2019 residents. Data collected electronically through a smartphone app. The survey variables aimed to investigate the respondents\u2019 awareness about vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and pertussis infections. Collected data concerning the respondents\u2019 socio-demographic characteristics, their perception toward vaccine uptake and the factors that motivate or demotivate them from taking influenza vaccine. The data were analysed statistically using the SPSS v.23.0. Differences in the characteristics of users from different countries were quantified through bivariate analysis. Other important variables and controlling factors were studied using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1812 respondents participated in the study. Their mean age was 27 years, 82% were male and 24% had \u2265 1 chronic diseases. The overall uptake of influenza vaccine was 17% (21% among \u201Cat risk\u201D people) and ranged from 15% in Saudi Arabia to 24% in Qatar. Doctor\u2019s advice (23%) and a perception of having low body immunity (21%) were the main cited reasons for being vaccinated, whereas unawareness about the vaccine (43%) was the main barrier. The overall uptake of pneumococcal vaccine in the preceding three years was 22% (25% among \u201Cat risk\u201D individuals) and ranged from 0% in Bahrain to 79% in Kuwait. The overall uptake of pertussis vaccine was 16% (31% among \u201Cvulnerable\u201D people), and ranged from 7% in Saudi Arabia to 75% in Oman. The overall uptake of meningococcal vaccine was 20% (29% among the \u201Cat risk\u201D people) and ranged from 3% in Oman to 50% in Bahrain.

A better understanding of the current prevalence and diversity of PRRSV and HEV in the UK, and their potential association, is needed to assess risks and target control measures appropriately. This study used plasma, tonsil, and cecal content samples previously collected from pigs in 14 abattoirs in England and Northern Ireland to study the prevalence of several pathogens including PRRSV and HEV. The diversity of PRRSV strains detected in these samples was analyzed by sequencing open reading frame 5 (ORF5), revealing no substantial difference in PRRSV strains from these clinically unaffected pigs relative to those from clinical cases of disease in the UK. Despite the potential immuno-modulatory effect of PRRSV infection, previously demonstrated to affect Salmonella and HEV shedding profiles, no significant association was found between positive PRRSV status and positive HEV status.","publish_time":"2017-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frossard, Jean-Pierre; Grierson, Sylvia; Cheney, Tanya; Steinbach, Falko; Choudhury, Bhudipa; Williamson, Susanna","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7f21bc68611eecc7ea9f57f86ebd7541d77b632.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5490802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5490802/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV","PRRS","PRRSV"],"locations":["England","United Kingdom","Northern Ireland"],"keyphrases":["positive PRRSV status","diversity of PRRSV strains","positive HEV status","UK","potential association","potential immuno-modulatory effect of PRRSV infection","clinical disease","zoonotic potential","study","unaffected pigs relative","clinical cases of disease","current prevalence","significant association","respiratory syndrome virus","cecal content samples","Hepatitis E virus","ORF5","concerns","tonsil","considerable economic losses","swine industry","risks","plasma","Northern Ireland","United Kingdom","abattoirs","England","profiles","substantial difference","open reading frame","better understanding","food safety sector","target control measures","Salmonella","pathogens","pig population","introduction"],"language":"en"},

It is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. In addition, it is considered, at present, a serious public health problem, ranking fourth in mortality worldwide. Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages and CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells. Neutrophil migration to the inflammation area could be mediated largely by cytokines related to CD4\u002B Th17 lymphocytes, because it has been shown that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 act as inducers for CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF secretion by epithelial cells of the airways. The aims of these molecules are differentiation, proliferation and recruitment of neutrophils. Furthermore, it is believed that CD4\u002B lymphocytes Th17 may be involved in protection against pathogens for which Th1 and Th2 are not prepared to fight. In COPD exacerbations, there is an increased cellularity in the lung region and respiratory tract. Therefore, the increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the airways and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines are directly related to the severity of exacerbations and that is the importance of the functions of Th17 profile in this entity.","publish_time":"2017-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ponce-Gallegos, Marco Antonio; Ram\u00EDrez-Venegas, Alejandra; Falf\u00E1n-Valencia, Ramc\u00E9s","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3a6451d69ba69ded9a9e9683d2668237482399f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5491572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","GM","CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airways","CD4","Th17 lymphocytes","lymphocytes Th17","COPD exacerbations","macrophages","recruitment of neutrophils","epithelial cells","number of neutrophils","T cells","pathophysiology of COPD","functions of Th17 profile","G-CSF","proinflammatory cytokines","severity of exacerbations","GM-CSF secretion","CXCL1","lung region","CXCL8","CXCL5","differentiation","inducers","increased cellularity","serious public health problem","molecules","present","proliferation","protection","importance","CD8","ongoing inflammatory process","respiratory tract","inflammation area","pathogens","Neutrophil migration","obstruction","entity","limitation of airflow","exposure","cigarette smoke","Th2","aims","mortality","addition"],"language":"en"},

In western Switzerland, an increase of severe cases of S. pyogenes invasive infections was observed between December 2015 and March 2016. Our aim was (i) to investigate these cases by the use of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and (ii) to determine the specific virulome and resistome of each isolate in order to undertake adequate public health measures. Eleven Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from 11 patients with severe invasive infections between December 13, 2015 and March 12, 2016 were included in our study. Practically, emm-typing, MLST and WGS were used to investigate the relatedness between the isolates. The presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes as well as mutations in transcriptional regulators of virulence and in genes encoding for antibiotic targets were assessed. Three and two groups of isolates shared the same emm-type and ST type, respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 14 to 32 SNPs between the strains of the same emm-type group, ruling out the possibility of a clonal outbreak. Mutations found in covS and rocA could partially explain an increased virulence. As these reassuring results were obtained in less than 10 days, no specific hospital hygiene and no dedicated public health measures had to be undertaken. WGS is a powerful technique to discriminate between closely related strains, excluding an outbreak in less than 10 days. Moreover, WGS provided extensive data on the virulome and resistome of all these strains.

Currently, no reliable biomarkers exist to help diagnose the severity of TBI to identify patients who are at risk of developing secondary injuries. Thus, the discovery of reliable biomarkers for the management of TBI would improve clinical interventions. Inflammatory markers are particularly suited for biomarker discovery as TBI leads to very early alterations in inflammatory proteins. Using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation assay, we measured in patients that had suffered mild TBI (n = 10) or severe TBI (n = 10) with extra-cranial injury or extracranial injury only (EC) (n = 10), 92 inflammation-associated proteins in serum obtained: \u003C1 hr (within 1-hour), 4\u201312 hr and 48\u201372 hr post injury. Changes were compared to healthy volunteers (HV). Our results identified CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL as novel early biomarkers of TBI. CST5 identified patients with severe TBI from all other cohorts and importantly was able to do so within the first hour of injury. AXIN1 and TRAIL were able to discriminate between TBI and HV at \u003C1 hr. We conclude that CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL are worthy of further study in the context of a pre-hospital or pitch-side test to detect brain injury.","publish_time":"2017-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hill, Lisa J.; Di Pietro, Valentina; Hazeldine, Jon; Davies, David; Toman, Emma; Logan, Ann; Belli, Antonio","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72a39958a44d1a0664d01a1965b3afba46aea827.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5504020.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI","Proseek Multiplex","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe TBI","management of TBI","severity of TBI","mild TBI","hour of injury","novel early biomarkers of TBI","extracranial injury","hr post injury","TRAIL","AXIN1","patients","CST5","Traumatic brain injury","extra-cranial injury","discovery of reliable biomarkers","inflammatory proteins","HV","inflammation-associated proteins","early alterations","biomarker discovery","Inflammatory markers","Proseek Multiplex Inflammation assay","context","pitch","test","pre-hospital","leading cause of neurological disability","study","serum","age groups","healthy volunteers","risk","clinical interventions","cohorts","results","secondary injuries","Changes"],"language":"en"},

Ebola virus disease (EVD) has a high mortality rate and no approved targeted treatment exists to date. A number of established drugs are being considered as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of EVD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify potential drug repositioning candidates and to assess the scientific evidence available on their efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, and other relevant trial registry platforms for studies published between January 1976 and January 2017. We included drug screening, preclinical studies, and clinical studies on repurposed drugs for the treatment of EVD. The risk of bias for animal studies and nonrandomized clinical studies was assessed. The quality of reporting for case series and case reports was evaluated. Finally, we selected drugs approved by established regulatory authorities, which have positive in vitro study outcomes and at least one additional animal or clinical trial. RESULTS: We identified 3301 publications, of which 37 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study type, methodology, and intervention. The risk of bias was high for 13 out of 14 animal studies. We selected 11 drugs with potential anti-EVD therapeutic effects and summarized their evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Several established drugs may have therapeutic effects on EVD, but the quality and quantity of current scientific evidence is lacking. This review highlights the need for well-designed and conducted preclinical and clinical research to establish the efficacy of potential repurposed drugs against EVD.","publish_time":"2017-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sweiti, Hussein; Ekwunife, Obinna; Jaschinski, Thomas; Lhachimi, Stefan K.","journal":"Curr Ther Res Clin Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8f3e1eae904d969c78f5fcd89e203d858fce89d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5522984.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5522984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal studies","preclinical studies","treatment of EVD","nonrandomized clinical studies","efficacy of potential repurposed drugs","number of established drugs","potential anti-EVD therapeutic effects","clinical trial","potential therapeutic agents","clinical research","additional animal","potential drug repositioning candidates","approved targeted treatment","scientific evidence available","risk of bias","quantity of current scientific evidence","Ebola virus disease","study outcomes","case series","quality of reporting","case reports","drug screening","high mortality rate","terms of study type","relevant trial registry platforms","Embase","MEDLINE","systematic literature search","numerous outbreaks","methodology","regulatory authorities","international public health emergency","recent outbreak","need","intervention","place","review","METHODS","BACKGROUND","publications","inclusion criteria","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: NCBI\u0027s built-in statistical tool, GEO2R, was used to calculate Student\u0027s t-tests for the associations found in a DNA expression study of adenocarcinoma and matched healthy lung tissue samples. The raw data was processed with GeneSpring\u2122 and then used to generate figures with and without Sidak\u0027s multiple comparison correction. RESULTS: Ten genes were found to be significantly associated with adenocarcinoma. Seven of these associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Notably, AGTR2, which encodes the AT(2) angiotensin II receptor subtype, was significantly underexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue (p \u003C 0.01). AGTR1, ACE, ENPEP, MME, and PRCP, which encode the AT(1) angiotensin II receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N, neprilysin, and prolylcarboxypeptidase, respectively, were also underexpressed. AGT, which encodes angiotensinogen, the angiotensin peptide precursor, was overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue.

Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. METHODS: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. RESULTS: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between- and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. CONCLUSIONS: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent \u201Cbranding\u201D. Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

This study aimed to see how mosquito cells can survive the infection during prosperous replication of the virus. In C6/36 cells, global protein translation was shut down after infection by DENV type 2 (DENV2). However, it returned to a normal level when infected cells were treated with an inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway. Based on a 7-Methylguanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (m7GTP) pull-down assay, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex was also identified in DENV2-infected cells. This suggests that most mosquito proteins are synthesized via canonical cap-dependent translation. When the PERK signal pathway was inhibited, both accumulation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential increased. This suggested that ER stress response was alleviated through the PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In the meantime, the activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the apoptosis-related cell death rate increased in C6/36 cells with PERK inhibition. This reflected that the PERK-signaling pathway is involved in determining cell survival, presumably by reducing DENV2-induced ER stress. Looking at the PERK downstream target, \u03B1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03B1), an increased phosphorylation status was only shown in infected C6/36 cells. This indicated that recruitment of ribosome binding to the mRNA 5\u2032-cap structure could have been impaired in cap-dependent translation. It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection. As synthesis of viral proteins was not affected by the PERK signal pathway, an alternate mode other than cap-dependent translation may be utilized. This finding provides insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of the DENV2. It was ecologically important for virus amplification in mosquitoes and transmission to humans.","publish_time":"2017-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Jiun-Nan; Chen, Tien-Huang; Chiang, Yi-Hsuan; Peng, Jing-Yun; Yang, Tsong-Han; Cheng, Chih-Chieh; Sofiyatun, Eny; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Chiang-Ni, Chuan; Chen, Wei-June","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6fa41b3711b116f3c39583812a0088793388395.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5618028.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618028/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","PERK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mosquito cells","DENV2-infected cells","PERK signal pathway","DENV2 infection","DENV2-infected C6","PERK inhibition","mosquito proteins","dynamic translation of proteins","global protein translation","canonical cap-dependent translation","PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins","PERK downstream target","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","shutdown of cellular protein translation","DENV2-induced ER stress","Survival of mosquitoes","cell survival","ER kinase","cap structure","synthesis of viral proteins","ER stress response","eukaryotic initiation factor","protein kinase RNA","virus amplification","dengue virus","pro-survival effect","prerequisite of viral transmission","increased phosphorylation status","continuous replication","DENV type","prosperous replication","apoptosis-related cell death rate","changes","\u03B1-subunit","pull-down assay","alternate mode","eIF2\u03B1","accumulation of reactive oxygen species","m7GTP","mRNA","eIF4F","PKR","inhibitor","mitochondrial membrane potential","triphosphate","complex","elucidating","recruitment of ribosome binding","host","humans","insights","normal level","meantime","activities of caspases","Methylguanosine","study"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate risk factors associated with isolation of multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in two tertiary-care hospitals, enrolling patients when first exacerbation appeared. Multidrug-resistance was determined according to European Centre of Diseases Prevention and Control classification. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty three exacerbations were included and microorganisms were isolated in 159 episodes. Multidrug-resistant pathogens were found in 20.1% episodes: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.5%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%) and Extended spectrum betalactamase \u002B Enterobacteriaceae (6.1%), and they were more frequent in exacerbations requiring hospitalization (24.5% vs. 10.2%, p: 0.016). Three independent multidrug-resistant risk factors were found: chronic renal disease (Odds ratio (OR), 7.60, 95% CI 1.92\u201330.09), hospitalization in the previous year (OR, 3.88 95% CI 1.37\u201311.02) and prior multidrug-resistant isolation (OR, 5.58, 95% CI 2.02\u201315.46). The proportion of multidrug-resistant in the 233 exacerbations was as follows: 3.9% in patients without risk factors, 12.6% in those with 1 factor and 53.6% if \u22652 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization in the previous year, chronic renal disease, and prior multidrug-resistant isolation are risk factors for identification multidrug-resistant pathogens in exacerbations. This information may assist clinicians in choosing empirical antibiotics in daily clinical practice.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Men\u00E9ndez, Rosario; M\u00E9ndez, Ra\u00FAl; Polverino, Eva; Rosales-Mayor, Edmundo; Amara-Elori, Isabel; Reyes, Soledad; Sahuquillo-Arce, Jos\u00E9 Miguel; Fern\u00E1ndez-Barat, Laia; Alcaraz, Victoria; Torres, Antoni","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e8855a1b4fa41526eac0e93264c024aef7f6c9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5622549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation of multidrug","independent multidrug-resistant risk factors","prior multidrug-resistant isolation","identification multidrug-resistant pathogens","Multidrug-resistance","proportion of multidrug","bronchiectasis exacerbations","hospitalization","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","recurrent infectious exacerbations","chronic renal disease","previous year","antibiotic resistance","episodes","frequent antibiotic treatment","chronic structural lung condition","enrolling patients","Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis","courses","empirical antibiotics","European Centre of Diseases Prevention","tertiary-care hospitals","population","Control classification","daily clinical practice","clinicians","BACKGROUND","Odds ratio","prospective observational study","Extended spectrum betalactamase","Enterobacteriaceae","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","information","microorganisms","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Daily application of a 0.1% solution of RA to the shaved skin of UM-HET3 mice on an AL diet produced a severe irritation that was evident by day 4, maximal at day 7\u20138 and still detectable at day 14. Skin irritation was characterized by redness, dryness, flaking and failure of the hair to grow at the treated site. In CR mice, the same treatment produced little detectable irritation. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the retinoid-treatment period (day 7 or day 14) and skin from these animals was examined histologically. In both AL and CR mice, a similar degree of epidermal hyperplasia was observed. Numerous inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells and granulocytes) were present in the skin of both groups. Occasional S100-positive cells (presumably Langerhans cells) were also observed in the epidermis of skin from both groups. S100-positive cells were also observed in the dermis. When skin from CR and AL mice was incubated in organ culture for 3 days (on day 7 after initiation of RA treatment), similar levels of four different pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in the conditioned medium. Soluble type I collagen levels were also similar. In contrast, the level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was lower in the conditioned medium of skin from CR mice than in conditioned medium from skin cultures of AL mice. Taken together, these studies suggest that CR may provide a way to mitigate the irritation that normally accompanies RA treatment without compromising the beneficial effects of retinoid use. CR appears to exert a protective effect at the target tissue level rather than by a reduction in pro-inflammatory events, per se.","publish_time":"2007-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varani, James; Bhagavathula, Narasimharao; Aslam, Muhammad Nadeem; Fay, Kevin; Warner, Roscoe L.; Hanosh, Andrew; Barron, Adam G.; Miller, Richard A.","journal":"Arch Dermatol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c70c564ac16ac5cae3c29fe153d7844f562fc49.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6f06eceba68d8caf051b642c4f9b3db8e5e6c612.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5644022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5644022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzczNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AL","RA","CR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CR mice","Skin irritation","skin cultures of AL mice","conditioned medium of skin","epidermis of skin","HET3 mice","AL diet","initiation of RA treatment","shaved skin of UM","topical treatment","mononuclear cells","Numerous inflammatory cells","Langerhans cells","detectable irritation","retinoid-treatment period","similar levels","solution of RA","Occasional S100-positive cells","severe irritation","pro-inflammatory events","groups","Animals","different pro-inflammatory cytokines","collagen levels","similar degree of epidermal hyperplasia","calorie-restricted","target tissue level","level of matrix metalloproteinase","beneficial effects of retinoid use","all-trans retinoic acid","granulocytes","response","protective effect","reduction","organ culture","days","total calories","end","redness","Soluble type","periods of time","ad libitum","hair","failure","months","contrast","dryness","treated site","Daily application","way","studies"],"language":"en"},

Computational analysis indicates that T cells migrate with an intermittent mode, switching between confined and almost straight migration, guided by lung-associated vasculature. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is required for both high-speed migration and straight motion. By contrast, inhibition of G\u03B1(i) signaling with pertussis toxin affects speed but not the intermittent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells.

We have examined the possibility to encode an arbitrary pair of protein domains as a dual gene, with the shorter coding sequence completely embedded in the longer one. For 500 \u00D7 500 domain pairs (X, Y), we computationally designed homologous pairs (X\u2032, Y\u2032) coded this way, using an algorithm that provably maximizes the sequence similarity between (X\u2032, Y\u2032) and (X, Y).

Interestingly, some of the molecular functions of CD147 rely on its glycosylation status: the highly glycosylated forms of CD147 induce MMPs whereas the lowly glycosylated forms inhibit MMP activation. Statins are hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate, thereby inhibiting all mevalonate-dependent pathways, including isoprenylation, N-glycosylation and cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we investigated the role of statins in the inhibition of macrophage differentiation and the associated process of MMP secretion through modulation of CD147. We observed that differentiation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to a macrophage phenotype led to upregulation of CD147 and CD14 and that this effect was inhibited by statins. At the molecular level, statins altered CD147 expression, structure and function by inhibiting isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. In addition, statins induced a shift of CD147 from its highly glycosylated form to its lowly glycosylated form. This shift in N-glycosylation status was accompanied by a decrease in the production and functional activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, these findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation by statins, making them interesting candidates for autoimmune disease therapy.","publish_time":"2017-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sasidhar, Manda V.; Chevooru, Sai Krishnaveni; Eickelberg, Oliver; Hartung, Hans-Peter; Neuhaus, Oliver","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6f6aee927db36fcefbc96af78e21ac7d0059b4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5734787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shift of CD147","glycosylated forms of CD147","CD147 expression","modulation of CD147","upregulation of CD147","molecular functions of CD147","MMP activation","role of statins","N-glycosylation status","lowly glycosylated forms","isoprenylation","associated process of MMP secretion","MMPs","inhibition of macrophage differentiation","functional activity of MMP","molecular level","synthesis of mevalonate","differentiation of macrophages","activation of matrix metalloproteinases","macrophage phenotype","cholesterol synthesis","novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation","mevalonate-dependent pathways","reductase inhibitors","interesting candidates","human monocytic cell line THP","hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme","decrease","structure","autoimmune disease therapy","findings","production","glycoprotein","effect","conclusion","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

Application of high GM-CSF levels prior to infection has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from pathogenic influenza infection in mice, but the mechanisms of protection and treatment efficacy have not been established. METHODS: Mice were infected intranasally with influenza A virus (PR8 strain). Supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF were induced in the airways using the double transgenic GM-CSF (DTGM) or littermate control mice starting on 3 days post-infection (dpi). Assessment of respiratory mechanical parameters was performed using the flexiVent rodent ventilator. RNA sequence analysis was performed on FACS-sorted airway macrophage subsets at 8 dpi. RESULTS: Supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF conferred a survival benefit, arrested the deterioration of lung mechanics, and reduced the abundance of protein exudates in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid to near baseline levels. Transcriptome analysis, and subsequent validation ELISA assays, revealed that excess GM-CSF re-directs macrophages from an \u201CM1-like\u201D to a more \u201CM2-like\u201D activation state as revealed by alterations in the ratios of CXCL9 and CCL17 in BAL fluid, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis predicted that GM-CSF surplus during IAV infection elicits expression of anti-inflammatory mediators and moderates M1 macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling by Type II interferon (IFN-\u03B3). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that application of high levels of GM-CSF in the lung after influenza A virus infection alters pathogenic \u201CM1-like\u201D macrophage inflammation. These results indicate a possible therapeutic strategy for respiratory virus-associated pneumonia and acute lung injury.

This physical barrier thus presents a perfect location for host antiviral restrictions that target enveloped viruses in general.

Background Shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related. Objectives To estimate the association of influenza with subsequent bacterial infections after full adjustment for confounding by seasonal and long\u2010term trends. Methods Time series of weekly counts of notified cases of invasive infections with Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, in Montr\u00E9al, Canada, 1996\u20132008, were modelled by negative binomial regression, with terms representing seasonal and long\u2010term trends and terms for numbers of positive laboratory tests for influenza A and B. Results The associations of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis with influenza disappeared after seasonal terms were added to the model. However, the influenza B count remained associated with the S. pyogenes counts for the same week and the following week: S. pyogenes incidence rate ratios were 1.0376 (95% CI: 1.0009\u20131.0757) and 1.0354 (0.9958\u20131.0766), respectively, for each increase of 1 in the influenza count. Conclusions Influenza B accounts for about 8percnt; of the incidence of invasive S. pyogenes infections, over and above any effect associated with modellable seasonal and long\u2010term trends. This association of influenza B with S. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in influenza B counts were followed by peaks in S. pyogenes notifications. This finding reinforces the case for universal immunization against influenza, as partial protection against the \u2018flesh eating disease\u2019.","publish_time":"2011-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allard, R.; Couillard, M.; Pilon, P.; Kafka, M.; B\u00E9dard, L.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/817b21573c7e32c6012a2bc7d34c013ebfdc46f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5779805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["B.

Infections by Enterobacteriaceae producing metallo-\u03B2-lactamases (MBLs), e.g., New Delhi metallo-\u03B2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are very difficult to treat. Development of effective MBL inhibitors to revive the efficacy of existing antibiotics is highly desirable. However, such inhibitors are not clinically available till now. Here we show that an anti-Helicobacter pylori drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), and related Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inhibit different types of MBLs via the mechanism, with one Bi(III) displacing two Zn(II) ions as revealed by X-ray crystallography, leading to the release of Zn(II) cofactors. CBS restores meropenem (MER) efficacy against MBL-positive bacteria in vitro, and in mice infection model, importantly, also slows down the development of higher-level resistance in NDM-1-positive bacteria. This study demonstrates a high potential of Bi(III) compounds as the first broad-spectrum B1 MBL inhibitors to treat MBL-positive bacterial infection in conjunction with existing carbapenems.","publish_time":"2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Runming; Lai, Tsz-Pui; Gao, Peng; Zhang, Hongmin; Ho, Pak-Leung; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Ma, Guixing; Kao, Richard Yi-Tsun; Li, Hongyan; Sun, Hongzhe","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49e1868b232e6ec98ae7cbc0745613925205e056.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5789847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL","CBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MBL-positive bacterial infection","Development of effective MBL inhibitors","broad-spectrum B1 MBL inhibitors","compounds","CBS","NDM","related Bi","efficacy of existing antibiotics","high potential of Bi","New Delhi metallo-\u03B2","existing carbapenems","release of Zn","Drug-resistant superbugs","different types of MBLs","mice infection model","development of higher-level resistance","anti-Helicobacter pylori drug","colloidal bismuth subcitrate","conjunction","huge threat","Enterobacteriaceae","mechanism","lactamases","meropenem","human health","X-ray crystallography","study","Infections","cofactors"],"language":"en"},

The degree of RSV replication was significantly reduced when X-31ca was administered before RSV infection without any RSV-specific antibody responses. The vaccination induced an immediate release of cytokines and infiltration of leukocytes into the respiratory tract, moderating the immune perturbation caused by RSV infection. The potency of protection against RSV challenge was significantly reduced in TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-) mice, confirming that the TLR3/7 signaling pathways are necessary for the observed immediate and short-term protection.

Here we report that TRIM56 E3 ligase-induced monoubiquitination of cGAS is important for cytosolic DNA sensing and IFN\u03B1\u03B2 production to induce anti-DNA viral immunity. TRIM56 induces the Lys335 monoubiquitination of cGAS, resulting in a marked increase of its dimerization, DNA-binding activity, and cGAMP production. Consequently, TRIM56-deficient cells are defective in cGAS-mediated IFN\u03B1\u03B2 production upon herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection. Furthermore, TRIM56-deficient mice show impaired IFN\u03B1\u03B2 production and high susceptibility to lethal HSV-1 infection but not to influenza A virus infection.

Flies were transferred to plates of Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and allowed to walk on the bacteria for a total of 5 min. After the flies were contaminated, they were either immediately collected to quantify bacteria or were placed onto sterile plates to clean for 5 or 10 min. After cleaning, flies were placed into tubes with 1 ml of sterile 0.85% saline and were gently shaken for 1 min to remove bacteria. A serial dilution was made and 50-\u00B5l spot titers were plated. Cleaning behavior was also monitored and scored for a period of 5 min. Results demonstrate a bacterial reduction for both bacteria on all three fly species.

This suggests that ribosome trapping, particularly in the leader region, represents a new checkpoint for the repression of lytic replication. We could identify 25 upstream open reading frames (uORFs) located upstream of coding transcripts that displayed 5\u2032 leader ribosome trapping, six of which were located in the leader region shared by many latent transcripts. These uORFs repressed viral translation and are likely to play an important role in the regulation of EBV translation.","publish_time":"2018-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bencun, Maja; Klinke, Olaf; Hotz-Wagenblatt, Agnes; Klaus, Severina; Tsai, Ming-Han; Poirey, Remy; Delecluse, Henri-Jacques","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/219fb67386566e8bd98da17b591ae91ffc1f2b0d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/89767ba998659a73d2be1534cfaacdff2fbc0488.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5887285.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5887285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV transcripts","leader ribosome trapping","viral translation","coding transcripts","regulation of EBV translation","translation rates","variable ribosome recruitment","leader regions","ribosome accumulation","ribosome profiling","latent transcripts","variable transcription","infected cells","variable efficiency","map new translation initiation sites","uORFs","monosomes","weakly replicating EBV strains","new checkpoint","subset of lytic genes","repression of lytic replication","non-coding RNAs","upstream open reading frames","key transactivators BZLF1","BRLF1","coverage","important role","genome","Epstein-Barr virus","similar process","polysomes"],"language":"en"},

The comparative chemopreventive effects of ACEIs and ARBs in high-risk populations with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have yet to be investigated. METHODS: From 2005 to 2014, high-risk HBV and HCV cohorts of hypertensive patients without HCC history were recruited from three linked national databases of Taiwan, and were classified into two groups based on the ACEI or ARB exposure within the initial six months after initiating antiviral agent. Intergroup differences in clinical characteristics and duration of drug exposure within study period were evaluated. HCC-free survival was compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression including time-dependent variables for the use of ACEIs or ARBs and other medications was applied to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Among the 7724 patients with HBV and 7873 with HCV, 46.3% and 42.5%, respectively, had an initial exposure to ACEIs or ARBs. The median durations of exposure were 36.4 and 38.9 months for the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. The median durations of ACEI or ARB use during study period between initial exposure and nonexposure groups were 41.8 vs. 18.3 months and 46.4 vs. 22.7 months for the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. No significant difference was observed in HCC risk within 7 years between the initial exposure and non-exposure groups. After adjustment for comorbidities, namely liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hyperlipidemia, and medications, namely aspirin, metformin, and statins, the hazard ratios (HRs) for ACEI or ARB exposure for HCC risk were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81\u20131.16) and 0.96 (0.80\u20131.16) in the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. In the HCV cohort, the increased HCC risk was associated with ACEI or ARB use in patients without cirrhosis, DM, and hyperlipidemia (HR: 4.53, 95% CI: 1.46\u201314.1). CONCLUSION: Compared with other significant risk and protective factors for HCC, ACEI or ARB use in the HBV and HCV cohorts was not associated with adequate protective effectiveness under standard dosages and may not be completely safe.

Method A case series of COVID-19 patients with RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were studied by a retrospective chart review. A literature search identified 9 similar studies of single cases and case series, which were also included. Results There were 4 COVID-19 inpatients with RD from our hospital, and the mean age was 57 \u00B1 21 years. Two patients had a mild infection, and 2 developed severe COVID-19 related respiratory complications, including 1 patient on secukinumab requiring mechanical ventilation and 1 patient on rituximab developing viral pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation. All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe COVID-19 with normal lymphocyte counts, and high levels of IL-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RD. In the literature, there were 9 studies of COVID-19 involving 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on DMARDs or biologics, of which TNF\u03B1 inhibitors were most frequently used. Two tocilizumab users had a mild infection. Two patients were on rituximab with 1 severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients were on secukinumab with 1 hospitalization. Of the total 201 cases, 12 died, with an estimated mortality of 5.9% Conclusion Patients with RD are susceptible to COVID-19. Various DMARDs or biologics may affect the viral disease course differently. Patients on hydroxychloroquine, TNF\u03B1 antagonists or tocilizumab may have a mild viral illness. Rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease.

Methods: We developed a mechanistic transmission model to simulate a range of scenarios of COVID-19 spread in the Greater Toronto Area. We estimated healthcare needs against 2019 daily admissions using healthcare administrative data, and applied outputs to hospital-specific data on catchment, capacity, and baseline non-COVID admissions to estimate potential surge by day 90 at two hospitals (St. Michael\u0092s Hospital [SMH] and St. Joseph\u0092s Health Centre [SJHC]). We examined fast/large, default, and slow/small epidemics, wherein the default scenario (R0 2.4) resembled the early trajectory in the GTA. Results: Without further interventions, even a slow/small epidemic exceeded the city\u0092s daily ICU capacity for patients without COVID-19. In a pessimistic default scenario, for SMH and SJHC to remain below their non-ICU bed capacity, they would need to reduce non-COVID inpatient care by 70% and 58% respectively. SMH would need to create 86 new ICU beds, while SJHC would need to reduce its ICU beds for non-COVID care by 72%. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. If physical distancing reduces contacts by 20%, maximizing the diagnostic capacity or syndromic diagnoses at the community-level could avoid a surge at each hospital. Interpretation: As distribution of the city\u0092s surge varies across hospitals over time, efforts are needed to plan and redistribute ICU care to where demand is expected. Hospital-level surge is based on community-level transmission, with community-level strategies key to mitigating each hospital\u0092s surge.

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of April 18, COVID-19 cases have been found in 53 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-five percent of the cases have been identified in 5 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Narayanganj, followed by Dhaka, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh and Barishal. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 4, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57% rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahaman Khan, H.; Howlader, T.; Islam, M.

It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus\u2019 pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells with EC50 values ranging from 2.0 to 13 \u00B5M and selectivity indices ranging from 1.5 to \u003E10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. Our data suggest that autophagy pathways could be targeted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and become an important component of drug combination therapies to improve the treatment outcomes for COVID-19.

These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein.

We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients\u0027 electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p\u003C0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group.

Keywords used included COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually scanned for additional studies. Findings: Of the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures). The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon information found in guidelines from hospitals and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions on data collected by agencies such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, ISDA, and Worldometer. None of the case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of participants numbered less than 500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients. However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, pre-existing health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried. Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 can be divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia) and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to modeling the stages of disease progression, we have also created a treatment algorithm which considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized treatment for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguilar, Richard B; Hardigan, Patrick; Mayi, Bindu; Sider, Darby; Piotrkowski, Jared; Mehta, Jinesh; Dev, Jenankan; Seijo, Yelenis; Lewis Camargo, Antonio; Andux, Luis; Hagen, Kathleen; Hernandez, Marlow B","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee6641ad22ab8609f549a1867da076b43bcfbd76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071548v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar","CDC","FDA","Worldometer"],"locations":["China","Vietnam","Rwanda","Israel","France","United Kingdom","Netherlands","Canada","United States"],"keyphrases":["treatment modalities","treatment algorithm","case studies","individualized treatment protocols","standard treatment approach","additional studies","cohort studies","investigational treatment options","relevant studies","literature search","clinical tests","clinical algorithms","clinical reports","stages of disease progression","Evidence Review","included COVID","variability of patient clinical presentation","viral levels","staged progression","thorough review of scholarly articles","SARS-CoV","viral load","quality review article","survivability","MERS-CoV","mortality","evidence-based recommendations","large number of participants","United Kingdom","United States","systemic inflammation","number of factors","distinct Stages","additional unique references","largest group of participants","inflammatory markers","Taiwan","Vietnam","Israel","Japan","pathophysiology","comorbidities","Rwanda","France","efficacy","seroconversion","China","Canada","care","microbiology","drug classes","need","pre-existing health conditions","hospitals","clinics","agencies","IHME","ISDA","CDC","FDA","manuscript","terms","Heyn et","Netherlands","PubMed","respect","months","nCov","growing morbidity","unified framework","following electronic databases","guidelines","staff","weeks","decisions","body","Figures","time of infection","fewer","patients","focus","Google Scholar","Reference lists","study","information","procedures","Worldometer","inclusion","language restriction","pulmonary involvement","hypoxemia","Conclusion","Relevance","Keywords","paper","pharmacology","MEDLINE","CINAHL","Embase","Objective","Findings","Importance"],"language":"en"},

Abstract In March 2003 the healthcare system of Toronto had to respond to an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. This infectious disease due to a novel coronavirus spread rapidly because this infectious agent was highly contagious and contaminated many caregivers. The increase in the demand in critical care beds with concomitantly a decrease in the number of caregivers sick or in quarantine, deeply disorganized the emergency and critical care system. Lack of preparedness, absence of coordination and leadership, poor communication were identified as factors amplifying the impact of this outbreak. Rapidly, however a disaster plan was implemented allowing for better organizing the response of hospitals, allowing the control of the outbreak. During the second phase of the outbreak in April 2003, a coordinated network of hospital is designed to isolate the patients and provide best evidenced care with optimal protection of the caregivers. Several recommendations resulted from the retrospective analysis of these events. These were used to develop a transformation of the healthcare system in Ontario, with creation of local health integrated networks, reorganization of the acute care system with increased capacity, development of infectious disease control. In preparation of a new outbreak, provincial and local task forces have been implemented to provide recommendations in collaboration with the newly created Public Health Agency of Canada.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brunet, F.-P.","journal":"R\u00E9animation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8885171bc458c03647790ec6dfe1b00402bd3c63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1624069307000357; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1624069307000357","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["however"],"organizations":["integrated networks","Public Health Agency of Canada"],"locations":["Toronto","Ontario"],"keyphrases":["the caregivers","the healthcare","the outbreak in April","the acute care","decrease in the number","allowing the control","The increase in the demand in critical care beds with concomitantly","in Ontario","During the second phase","better organizing the response","deeply disorganized the emergency","in quarantine","In preparation","syst\u00E8me de soins","hospital is designed to isolate the patients","this outbreak","implemented to provide recommendations in collaboration with the newly created Public Health Agency","Abstract In March","Several recommendations resulted from the retrospective analysis","Toronto had to respond to an outbreak","with creation","poor communication were identified as factors amplifying the impact","new outbreak","soins r\u00E9gionaux","r\u00E9seau de soins","This infectious disease","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie gr\u00E2ce","acteurs du syst\u00E8me","These were used to develop","with increased capacity","infectious disease control","compl\u00E8te transformation du syst\u00E8me","provide best evidenced care with optimal protection","caregivers sick","agent infectieux","strat\u00E9gie de coordination","SRAS","particulier","services d\u0027urgence","r\u00E9ponse coordonn\u00E9e","r\u00E9ponse rapide","services de r\u00E9animation","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie de syndrome respiratoire aigu s\u00E9v\u00E8re","contaminated many caregivers","novel coronavirus spread rapidly because this infectious agent was highly contagious","disaster plan was implemented allowing","local health integrated networks","severe acute respiratory syndrome","moyens de communication","these events","niveau provincial","r\u00E9gion de Toronto","cr\u00E9ation de r\u00E9seaux","strat\u00E9gie hospitali\u00E8re","local task forces","d\u00E9sastres infectieux \u00E9ventuels","leadership","coordinated network","reorganization","hospitals","development","caract\u00E8re","however","contamination pr\u00E9coce","absence","Canada","mise","place","personnel hospitalier","professionnels de Sant\u00E9","le\u00E7ons tir\u00E9es","h\u00F4pitaux d\u00E9di\u00E9s","preparedness","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","lutte","groupes de travail","pand\u00E9mie de grippe aviaire","transfert adapt\u00E9s","Lack","mobilisation g\u00E9n\u00E9rale","s\u00E9v\u00E9rit\u00E9 de la maladie","fin","urgences","caract\u00E9ristiques","capacit\u00E9s","r\u00E9flexions"],"language":"fr"},

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID-19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT-PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For a patient with a prior probability of COVID-19 greater than 18%, at least two negative test results would be needed to lower the chances of COVID-19 below 5%. Caution is advised in generalizing these findings to other versions of the RT-PCR test that are being used in diverse geographic regions.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Padhye, N.

BACKGROUND. When the lockdowns are relaxed, the responsibility of mitigating the COVID-19 spread shifts from the governments to the individuals. To know how to conduct one-self, it is important for everyone to know the risks of transmission during the quotidian activities - meetings, meals, etc, from individuals who are known to them and looking healthy. METHODS. The detailed case-studies corresponding to 425 infections upon point-exposures over a specified duration are curated. The data from the case studies is summarized and reorganized to reflect different situations from the daily life. A meta-analysis of the attack rates of transmission and the number of infections per infected person are performed. RESULTS. The attack rates are very high in family dinners (66.7% (48.8-80.8%)) compared to sit-down dinners with lesser mixing among people eating at different tables (15.7% (12.1-20.1%)), both lasting a couple of hours. In an open workspace office floor organized in a two-half structure with shared elevators and restrooms and the employees speaking continuously, the average attack rate over the course of a few days was much higher in one half (78.7% (70.3-85.3%)) than the one for the entire floor (43.5% (37.0-50.1%)). Inferred data suggests that the transmission in elevators and trains may be lower under the conditions of using masks. In most of the instances we studied, the infected individuals spreading (35/44) and even super-spreading (3/6) were mostly without symptoms of coughing, sneezing or a fever. CONCLUSIONS. Although the basic reproduction number R0 is around 3.0, the number of infections caused, including the super-spreading events, seem to be limited by the number of personal interactions in a group and their proximity. By acknowledging the risks in daily life, from healthy-looking persons, one may be able to organize their interactions better to reduce the chances of spreading or super-spreading infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prakash, M.

In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce. [Objectives] To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. [Methods] Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. [Results] A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58{\u002B/-}13.38 year old) among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 (17/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 (13/48, 27.1%) patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR 10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. [Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, F.; Yang, D.; Li, J.; Gao, P.; Chen, T.; Cheng, Z.; Cheng, K.; Fang, Q.; Pan, W.; Yi, C.; Fan, H.; Wu, Y.; Li, L.; Fang, Y.; Liu, J.; Tian, G.; He, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a63aee4fec9b225c82e699d5a7403d81d14f4ea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.21.20040121v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["hospital mortality of patients","hospital death","mechanism of cardiac injury","elevated cardiac troponin","suspected COVID","high-sensitivity cardiac troponin","admission","elevated hs-cTnI","HR","elevated d-dimer","early stage of COVID","hs-cTnI elevation","multivariate Cox regression analysis","risk factors","Wuhan","China","laboratory data of consecutive confirmed","higher SpO2","pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation","treatment","severe cases","adverse outcome","clinicians","relationship","test","Methods","Demographic","Hubei Province","female","cluster of coronavirus disease","hours","total","association","Conclusions","Studies","protective factor","mean age","electronic medical records","year old","Results","Objectives","countries","decrease","increase","Background","patents"],"language":"en"},

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ong, Edison; Wong, Mei U; Huffman, Anthony; He, Yongqun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5949605f1914ef77c319fdeaff0ee32ea93f0eea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp3 protein","SARS-CoV","N protein","membrane protein","used S protein","safe vaccine","MERS-CoV","vaccine development","predicted vaccine targets","vaccine candidates","safe COVID","coronavirus vaccine studies","entire proteome of SARS","emerging COVID","nsp8 proteins","developed Vaxign","non-structural proteins","human coronaviruses","Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool","T-cell epitopes","linear B-cell epitopes","promiscuous MHC","machine learning tool","new strategies","specific locations","nucleocapsid","functional domains","contagious disease","viral adhering","spike","clinical trial survey","host invasion","pathogenic strains","literature","pandemic","mild symptoms","high protective antigenicity","animals","investigation","adhesins"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model. Method: Data on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudi Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness. Result: We found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government. Conclusion: We show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID-19 in Saudi. Actions were taken by Saudi Arabia under the national slogan (We are all responsible) resulted in the observed reduced number of current and predicted cases and deaths compared to the UK approach (keep calm and carry on).","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Komies, S.; Aldhahir, A.

In physiological conditions arterial blood lactate concentration is equal or lower than central venous. The aim of this study was to explore if the COVID-19 induced lung cells damage was mirrored by an arterial lactatemia higher than the central venous one; then if the administration of immunosuppressant drugs (i.e. canakinumab) could normalize such abnormal lactate a-cv difference. Methods. Prospective cohort study started on March 25th 2020 for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy. Arterial and central venous blood samples were contemporary collected to calculate the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentration within 24 h from tracheal intubation (T0), and 24 hours after canakinumab administration (T1). Results. At the T0 19/21 (90.5%) patients showed a pathologic Delta a-cv lactate (median 0.22 mmol/L; IQR 0.07-0.36), suggesting severe inflammation. In the 13 patients undergoing canakinumab administration, at the T1 Delta a-cv lactate decreased in 92.3% of cases, being the decrease statistically significant (T0: median 0.15, IQR 0.07-0.25 mmol/L; T1: median -0.01, IQR -0.09-0.04 mmol/L; p=0.002). Conclusion. A reversed Delta a-cv lactate is likely to be one of the effects of COVID-19 related cytokine storm, that could reflect a derangement in the lung cells mitochondrial metabolism induced by inflammation or other uncoupling mediators. Delta a-cv lactate decrease may reflect the anti-inflammatory activity of canakinumab.

Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms. Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Chih-Cheng; Ko, Wen-Chien; Lee, Ping-Ing; Jean, Shio-Shin; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fa20e0031efc878db0acc83fbdc2f9b35dc5c65.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301874; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301874?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID","extra-respiratory symptoms","respiratory tract symptoms","adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","initial presentation of SARS","direct invasion of SARS","infection","consideration of COVID","cardiac involvement","ocular","gastrointestinal involvement","haematological symptoms","patients","clinicians","associated clinical specimens","manifest fever","acute kidney injury","ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease","range of clinical presentations","coagulation disorders","signs","hepatic","systems","agents","thrombotic complications","organs","comprehensive review","screening test","differential diagnoses","global health threat","protective measures","poor prognosis","addition"],"language":"en"},

The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days.

Corresponding selenoproteins play critical roles in protecting against reactive oxygen species and environmental stress. Using a novel animal model deficient in Alkbh8, we have investigated the importance of epitranscriptomic systems in the response to naphthalene (NA), an abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, glutathione depleter and lung toxicant found in tobacco smoke, gasoline and mothballs. Objectives Our goal was to define the molecular reprogramming of Alkbh8 deficient (Alkbh8def) mice and evaluate the roles that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 and selenoproteins play in mitigating NA-induced toxicity and lung dysfunction. Methods We performed basal lung analysis and NA exposure studies using WT, Alkbh8def and Cyp2abfgs-null mice, the latter of which lack the cytochrome P450 enzymes required for NA bioactivation. We characterized gene expression, molecular markers of damage, viability and tolerance to NA. Results Under basal conditions, lungs from Alkbh8def mice have increased oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and 8-isoprostane levels, and have reprogrammed at the molecular level to display increased stress response transcripts. In addition, the ALKBH8 writer deficient lungs have a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. Alkbh8def mice are more sensitive to NA than WT, showing higher susceptibility to lung damage both at the cellular and molecular levels. WT mice develop a tolerance to NA after 3 days, defined as resistance to a high challenging dose after repeated exposures, which is absent in Alkbh8def mice, with writer deficient not surviving NA exposure. Discussion We conclude that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 plays a protective role against NA-induced lung dysfunction and promotes NA tolerance. Our work provides an early example of how epitranscriptomic systems can regulate the response to environmental stress in vivo.","publish_time":"2019-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leonardi, Andrea; Kovalchuk, Nataliia; Yin, Lei; Endres, Lauren; Evke, Sara; Nevins, Steven; Martin, Samuel; Dedon, Peter C.; Melendez, J.

There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess the prevalence of infection, as well as ascertain individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which may lack scalability to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests in the coming year. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that just depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum/plasma or whole blood and a short five-minute assay time. A novel fusion protein was designed that binds red blood cells (RBC) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against the H antigen and displays the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Upon mixing of the fusion protein, RBD-scFv with recovered COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs, we observed agglutination of RBCs, indicating the patient developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Given that the test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed with only the protein reagent required at projected manufacturing cost at U.S. cents per test. We anticipate our agglutination assay may find extensive use in low-resource settings for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kruse, Robert L.; Huang, Yuting; Smetana, Heather; Gehrie, Eric A.; Amukele, Tim K.; Tobian, Aaron A.R.; Mostafa, Heba H.; Wang, Zack Z.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e005b40763e8cea9bdd7a31ac2e0b13b1d3a304.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.094490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","protein reagent","spike protein","antibodies","novel fusion protein","RBD-scFv","patient serum","agglutination of RBCs","millions of antibody tests","Current serological tests","agglutination assay","surface of RBCs","world","recovered COVID","future infection","prevalence of infection","lateral flow assays","red blood cells","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","short five-minute assay time","alternative method of antibody testing","ELISA","extensive use","low-resource settings","projected manufacturing cost","single-chain variable fragment","receptor-binding domain","demand of hundreds","traditional technologies","hospital clinical labs","cases","scalability","H antigen","methods","cents","plasma","coming year","urgent need","globe","mixing","significant mortality","individuals","halt","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

A customary response to a surge of a communicable disease is to separate healthcare systems into cohorts, such that patients with other conditions can be treated safely without risk of infection. A challenge with COVID-19 is the existence of currently asymptomatic infections, which without aggressive testing and isolation might enter the non-COVID-19 cohort either through unknowingly infected patients or health care workers. Using stochastic simulations we study the impacts of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. In the base case without testing or PPE, healthcare is rapidly overwhelmed, and becomes a net contributor to the force of infection. We find that effective use of PPE by both HCW and patients can prevent this situation, while testing alone is less effective. We also find that even imperfectly effective use of PPE can provide substantial protection and decrease the force of infection.

The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 during their pregnancy. Methods: Four databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched on March 25, 2020, using the following keywords: \u0027COVID-19\u0027, \u0027nCoV-2019\u0027, and \u0027coronavirus\u0027. Articles included if they reported either the symptoms, treatments for the women who had been infected with the COVID-19 during their pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes. The selected articles\u0027 results were summarized employing a narrative synthesis approach. Results: A total of nine studies were selected for this study, comprising 101 infected pregnant women. Other than the infected general population, infected pregnant women reported different symptoms; however, fever (66.7%), cough (39.4%), fatigue (15.2%), and breathing difficulties (14.1%) were common. Infected pregnant women were given different treatments than the general infected population. The C-section was a common (83.9%) mode of delivery among infected pregnant women, and a higher proportion of births were preterm births (30.4%) and low birth weight (17.9%). Conclusions: Pregnant infected women had different symptoms, and they were given dissimilar treatments than the general infected population. Healthcare providers may have appropriately informed about these symptoms and treatments. They, therefore, would be able to handle infection during pregnancy effectively, which would reduce common adverse consequences among infected pregnant women.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Md.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria\u0027s estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, H.; Dickens, B.

Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we suggest that pre-symptomatic transmission could be a significant driver of the infection spread. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouchnita, Anass; Jebrane, Aissam","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054460","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["social distancing measures","social force model","model predictions","spread","indirect transmission","risk of infection transmission","transmission dynamics of COVID","multi-scale model","measures stricter","pre-symptomatic transmission","lockdown","global health","Wuhan","China","novel coronavirus","Public health","global outbreak","epidemic curve","early dynamics of disease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","non-pharmaceutical interventions","crowds","major threat","SARS-CoV","significant driver","motion of individual agents","individuals","mechanisms of direct","panic situations","Italy","restricted movement","deceased","pandemic","effect"],"language":"en"},

We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged.

Single particle cryo-EM excels as an imaging technique to solve static structures of proteins, but existing computational 3D reconstruction methods for cryo-EM data have not been effective in practice for solving structures or modelling motion of flexible proteins. We introduce 3D variability analysis (3DVA), an algorithm that models the conformational landscape of a molecule as a linear subspace, and is able to fit the model to experimental cryo-EM data at high resolution. 3DVA makes it possible, for the first time, to resolve and visualize detailed molecular motions of both large and small proteins. Through extensive experimental results on cryo-EM data, we demonstrate the ability of 3DVA to resolve multiple flexible motions of \u03B1-helices in the sub-50 kDa transmembrane domain of a GPCR complex, bending modes of a sodium ion channel, five types of symmetric and symmetry-breaking flexibility in a proteasome, and large motions in a spliceosome complex. We also show that 3DVA can uncover discrete conformational states of heterogenous mixtures of ribosome particles from a single sample. The results demonstrate that 3DVA enables new biological insight to be extracted from single particle cryo-EM data. 3DVA is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package, and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Punjani, Ali; Fleet, David J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe8a6011368a22cf4314ecf33610affa68547a0a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.032466","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DVA","experimental cryo-EM data","single particle cryo-EM data","large motions","small proteins","static structures of proteins","detailed molecular motions","modelling motion of flexible proteins","single sample","multiple flexible motions of \u03B1","extensive experimental results","GPCR complex","conformational landscape","spliceosome complex","D reconstruction methods","D variability analysis","molecular machinery of living cells","discrete conformational states of heterogenous mixtures of ribosome particles","helices","types of symmetric","kDa transmembrane domain","sodium ion channel","symmetry-breaking flexibility","modes","proteasome","practice","imaging technique","high resolution","new biological insight","dynamic molecules","linear subspace","algorithm","cryoSPARC software package","notable structural studies","time"],"language":"en"},

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by a- and oligosymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Snoeck, C.

Here, we provide preliminary data on the altruistic stem cell (ASC) based defense against a mouse corona virus; MHV-1 infection. In a mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated M. tuberculosis (Mtb) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This defense involved the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271\u002B MSCs in the lung to ASC phenotype characterized by activation of genes involved in the HIF-2alpha stemness pathway. The conditioned media of the ASCs exhibited direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells. MHV-1 infected Mtb harboring group versus MHV-1 alone group exhibited an 8-fold (p\u003C0.02; n=4) higher ASC reprogramming and 5-fold (p\u003C0.001; n=3, student t test) higher anti-viral activity. However, ASCs facilitated intracellular replication and extracellular release of Mtb. Thus, our data suggest that MSCs exert an innate defense against MHV-1 by activating the ASC defense mechanism, which might be exploited by dormant Mtb to undergo reactivation. Hence, our findings may provide a novel anti-viral defense mechanism against novel corona virus SARS-Cov2, which could be further utilized to develop vaccine against COVID19. Our findings also predict a potential increase of tuberculosis in post-COVID19 era.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pathak, Lekhika; Gayan, Sukanya; Pal, Bidisha; Talukdar, Joyeeta; Bhuyan, Seema; Sandhya, Sorra; Yeger, Herman; Baishya, Debabrat; Das, Bikul","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2528dbf78fd0be58713baf8cf71fc7abc92414f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.077883","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASC","ASCs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-MHV","ASC defense mechanism","model of MHV","novel anti-viral defense mechanism","altruistic defense mechanism","innate defense","higher anti-viral activity","infected Mtb","dormant Mtb","direct anti-viral activity","higher ASC reprogramming","ASC phenotype","altruistic stem cell","extracellular release of Mtb","fold lower viral loads","mouse corona virus","lung","adult stem cells","mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell","ASCs","MSCs","group","infection","findings","potential increase of tuberculosis","novel corona virus SARS-Cov2","potential enhancement","preliminary data","alveolar epithelial cells","post-COVID19 era","healthy control mice","student t test","induced toxicity","HIF","intracellular replication","activation of genes","bacteria","dormancy","conditioned media","alpha stemness pathway","CD271","expansion","niche","reactivation","vaccine"],"language":"en"},

Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93. The Trinary scheme was more device-independent and consistent with specialists than the Plain scheme, which achieved a F1 score of 0.847, higher than the Plain scheme (0.774), specialists (0.785) and residents (0.644). Conclusions: Our study potentially provides an accurate early diagnosis tool on chest CT for NCP with high transferability, and shows high efficiency in differentiating NCP and IP, helping to reduce misdiagnosis and contain the pandemic transmission.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, M.; Chen, Y.; Wang, D.; Xu, Y.; Yao, W.; Huang, J.; Jin, X.; Pan, Z.; Tan, J.; Wang, L.; Xia, Y.; Zou, L.; Xu, X.; Wei, J.; Guan, M.; Feng, J.; Zhang, H.; Qu, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd6fdf2cc09a1ccaf015c0c74902bc2d3b297d4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.24.20043117v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NCP patients","NCP lesions","differentiating NCP","distinguished NCP","IP patients","IP lesions","confirmed NCP cases","NCP designated hospitals","suspected patients","confirmed viral pneumonia patients","chest CT images","Plain scheme","high sensitivity","high transferability","high efficiency","influenza pneumonia","specialists","Trinary scheme","novel coronavirus pneumonia","clinical images","auto-detection","early stage","integrated deep learning framework","training set","nucleic acid detection","accurate early diagnosis tool","area","expert-level performance","advantage","receiver","device-independent","intricate structures","medical image analysis","time of crisis","classification schemes","characteristic curve","study","consolidation","Background","external validation","F1 score","AUC","misdiagnosis","Hu","Methods","nodules","pandemic transmission","Results","centers","intensity","Conclusions","residents"],"language":"en"},

However, in resource-constrained countries such as the Philippines, test kits have limited availability. As of 12 April 2020, there are 11 testing centers in the country that have been accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct testing. In this paper, we determine the optimal percentage allocation of COVID-19 test kits among accredited testing centers in the Philippines that gives an equitable chance to all infected individuals to be tested. Heterogeneity in testing accessibility, population density of municipalities, and the capacity of testing facilities are included in the model. Our results showed that the range of optimal allocation per testing center are: Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (4.17%-6.34%), San Lazaro Hospital (14.65%-24.03%), University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (16.25%-44.80%), Lung Center of the Philippines (15.8%-26.40%), Baguio General Hospital Medical Center (0.58%-0.76%), The Medical City, Pasig City (5.96%-25.51%), St. Luke\u0027s Medical Center, Quezon City (1.09%-6.70%), Bicol Public Health Laboratory (0.06%-0.08%), Western Visayas Medical Center (0.71%-4.52%), Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (1.02%-2.61%), and Southern Philippines Medical Center (approx 0.01%). If there will be changes in the number of testing centers, our model can still be used to modify the test kit allocation. Our results can serve as a guide to the authorities in distributing the COVID-19 test kits. These can also be used to determine the capacity of testing centers and the effects of increasing its number. The model can also be used for proposing additional number and location of new testing centers.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buhat, Christian Alvin H; Duero, Jessa Camille C; Felix, Edd Francis O; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo; Mamplata, Jonathan B","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe6b9f02992853e1681ea28162a0936ac9f153a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Research Institute for Tropical Medicine","San Lazaro Hospital","University","National Institutes of Health","Lung Center of the Philippines","Baguio General Hospital Medical Center","St. Luke\u0027s Medical Center","Bicol Public Health Laboratory","Western Visayas Medical Center"],"locations":["Philippines","Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center","Southern Philippines Medical Center"],"keyphrases":["number of testing centers","capacity of testing centers","accredited testing centers","testing accessibility","Southern Philippines Medical Center","Luke\u0027s Medical Center","Medical City","capacity of testing facilities","location of new testing centers","Lung Center","Western Visayas Medical Center","test kits","Baguio General Hospital Medical Center","Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center","model","test kit allocation","Philippines-National Institutes of Health","optimal percentage allocation of COVID","range of optimal allocation","Quezon City","additional number","Pasig City","Department of Health","infected individuals","results","Bicol Public Health Laboratory","San Lazaro Hospital","isolation","population density of municipalities","Research Institute","early detection","treatment of coronavirus disease","Heterogeneity","equitable chance","approx","effects","Tropical Medicine","resource-constrained countries","University","DOH","availability","guide","paper","authorities","country"],"language":"en"},

However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (22 nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labelled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for 89 clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output.

However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated following vaccination by these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody response induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we immunized rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1\u002BS2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213 as control). Antibody response was analyzed by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1\u002BS2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.

The elevation of cytokines in blood is crucial to induce cytokine storm and immunosuppression in the transition of severity in COVID-19 patients. However, the comprehensive changes of serum proteins in COVID-19 patients throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In this work, we developed a high-density antibody microarray and performed an in-depth proteomics analysis of serum samples collected from early COVID-19 (n=15) and influenza (n=13) patients. We identified a large set of differentially expressed proteins (n=125) that participate in a landscape of inflammation and immune signaling related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the significant correlations of neutrophil and lymphocyte with the CCL2 and CXCL10 mediated cytokine signaling pathways was identified. These information are valuable for the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, identification of biomarkers and development of the optimal anti-inflammation therapy.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, X.; Zhang, X.; Wu, X.; Lu, M.; Wang, D.; Xu, M.; Wang, H.; Dai, J.; Duan, H.; Xu, Y.; Yu, X.; Li, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095836v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early COVID","understanding of COVID","patients","SARS-CoV","contagious infection","cytokine storm","comprehensive changes of serum proteins","landscape of inflammation","CXCL10 mediated cytokine","optimal anti-inflammation therapy","in-depth proteomics analysis of serum samples","development","lymphocyte","CCL2","blood","immunosuppression","pathogenesis","high-density antibody microarray","identification of biomarkers","transition of severity","pathways","human lives","significant correlations of neutrophil","elevation of cytokines","influenza","large set","information","world","work","Coronavirus disease"],"language":"en"},

While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and April 23rd, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients\u0027 initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Results Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient\u0027s oxygen supply and selected laboratory results were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Conclusion Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient\u0027s first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heldt, F. S.; Vizcaychipi, M.

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and employ systems that effectively manage the demand for services. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the first five weeks of a 24/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline. Design: Cohort study using electronic health records. Setting: A single large health care system in Northeast Ohio. Participants: During 5 weeks of operation, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers) and were evaluated by a registered nurse (RN) using standardized protocols. Of these, 4,213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). The mean age of callers was 42 years. 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid or uninsured. Intervention: Physician telehealth visits for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. Results: Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 (7%) patients had a subsequent ED visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency room use (OR=4.73, 95%CI 1.37-16.39, p=.014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Conclusions and Relevance: Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Margolius, D.; Hennekes, M.; Yaho, J.; Einstadter, D.; Gunzler, D.; Chehade, N.; Sehgal, A.

Abstract Seasonal flu is caused by influenza viruses A and B. These enveloped viruses have a genome made up of seven or eight RNA fragments. The different subtypes are determined by the nature of the two surface glycoproteins HA and NA. Seasonal flu is an epidemic wintertime illness occurring in temperate climate zones. Its epidemiology is linked to the great variability of the virus in time, necessitating an alert system that detects dominating circulating variants each year and that determines the vaccination composition. Clinical flu symptoms are not sufficiently specific to allow for diagnosis with virological tests. This is especially true during non-epidemic periods as well as in subjects older than 65 and younger than five. Children are especially vulnerable to influenza virus infections. Hospitalization occurs more frequently, the younger the child. In children younger than two years, the infection can be pauci-symptomatic and is sometimes detected from non-respiratory symptoms such as lethargy, convulsions, and dizziness. In all cases of respiratory syndrome compatible with influenza virus infection in hospitalized subjects, virological flu diagnosis is of utmost interest. Several tools are available to allow for direct viral detection in respiratory specimens: cell culture isolation, antigenic detection, RNA molecular detection. Choice of method is based on the characteristics of the test: sensibility, specificity, speed and ease of realization, and cost.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vabret, A.; Dina, J.; Cuvillon-Nimal, D.; Nguyen, E.; Gouarin, S.; Petitjean, J.; Brouard, J.; Freymuth, F.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7354e6d3e99c8edf1b638ac84ebfa5eae4502812.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811410000301; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811410000301","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["L\u2019enfant"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus influenza","the virus in time","the younger the child","the nature","the test","the characteristics","isolement du virus","virus envelopp\u00E9s","The different subtypes","the infection can be","especially vulnerable to influenza virus infections","the two surface glycoproteins","influenza viruses","grande variabilit\u00E9 du virus","respiratory syndrome compatible with influenza virus infection in hospitalized subjects","virological flu diagnosis is","that determines the vaccination composition","Its epidemiology is linked to the great variability","In children younger than two years","method is based","Abstract Seasonal flu is caused","grippe saisonni\u00E8re","direct viral detection in respiratory specimens","Seasonal flu is an epidemic wintertime illness occurring in temperate climate zones","epidemic periods as well as in subjects older than","is sometimes detected from","This is especially true during","available to allow","younger than five","Clinical flu symptoms","sufficiently specific to allow","respiratory symptoms such as lethargy","antigenic detection","RNA molecular detection","convulsions","diagnostic virologique","ARN","ans","diagnosis with virological tests","syndrome respiratoire compatible","s\u00E9cr\u00E9tions respiratoires","caract\u00E9ristiques du test","d\u00E9tection mol\u00E9culaire","sujets hospitalis\u00E9s","composition vaccinale","maladie \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","glycoprot\u00E9ines de surface","examen virologique","seven or eight RNA fragments","necessitating an alert","cell culture isolation","variants circulants dominant","These enveloped viruses","that detects dominating circulating variants each year","symptomatic","sensibility","determined","rapidit\u00E9","sp\u00E9cificit\u00E9","genome","alerte","chaque ann\u00E9e","Hospitalization occurs more frequently","specificity","antig\u00E8nes","cases","syst\u00E8me","sensibilit\u00E9","speed","utmost interest","cible privil\u00E9gi\u00E9e","simplicit\u00E9 de r\u00E9alisation","Several tools","recherche directe","place","ease","manifestations","l\u00E9thargie","temps","Choice","mise","\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie","co\u00FBt","realization","climat temp\u00E9r\u00E9","paucisymptomatique","malaises","dizziness","g\u00E9nome","outils","hospitalisation","jeune","sympt\u00F4mes cliniques","nourrisson","enfants","p\u00E9riode","choix de la m\u00E9thode","recours"],"language":"fr"},

We apply our model to COVID-!9 epidemics in South Korea, Italy and Spain.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webb, Glenn F; Magal, Pierre; Liu, Zhihua; Seydi, Ousmane","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0654ca52cd0b70219b60c955a5f1de2094d9a34.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056945","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Spain"],"keyphrases":["epidemics","number of symptomatic reported infectious individuals","number of asymptomatic infectious individuals","number of symptomatic unreported infectious individuals","severe symptoms","future number of cases","differential equations model of COVID","following important elements of COVID","early reported case data","regions","South Korea","team","Italy","time","Spain","world","work","goal"],"language":"en"},

Rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63 C) for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one-step and single-tube reaction, and the detection results were easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab samples, and the assay\u0027s specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h.

We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread; outcomes include the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine. We populated the model using COVID19-specific parameters for the natural history of the disease and data from Georgia on the agents interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a six-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The outcomes are compared at the state and community levels. Main outcomes are the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. Results: The combined intervention of shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from 180,000 under no intervention and 120,000 under school closure, respectively, to below 80,000, and delayed the peak from April to June or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 3-14% and 4-6% decrease in cumulative infection and fatality rates, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 80,000 to 50,000, and decreased cumulative infection rate by 50%. The total number of fatalities ranged from 6,150 to 17,900 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 7 days across counties. The peak percentage is similar across rural and urban counties. Region D is estimated to have the highest COVID19-related healthcare needs with 7,357 hospital beds, 1,141 ICU beds, and 558 ventilators. Conclusions and Relevance Shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduce COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes; delay the peak; and enable better preparedness. Time of the peak is projected to vary across locations, enabling reallocation of health system capacity.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keskinocak, P.; Oruc Aglar, B.

The model-based estimate of COVID-19 numbers for those aged 65\u002B is predicted to be between 34,000 to 104,000; a higher estimate attributable to inadequate precautions is predicted at 477,000 during April and June, 2020. Hospitalizations of patients both with and without ICU-admissions with more prevalent underlying conditions could range between 37,000 to 94,000 cases during the same period. These estimates may aid us in better understanding the potential volumes of patients requiring inpatient care.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"S.R. Srinivasa Rao, A.; Miller, D.

These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to \u0022Disease X\u0022 (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued.

Aim To characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional networks with focus on CVD. Methods Using bioinformatic tools, network medicine approaches and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction network which could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified top ACE2 interactors, including miRNAs which are shared regulators between the ACE2, virus-infection related proteins and heart interaction networks, using lung and nervous system networks as a reference. We also identified main SARS-CoV-2 risk groups and performed drug predictions for them. Results We found the same range of ACE2 expression confidence in respiratory and cardiovascular systems (averaging 4.48 and 4.64, respectively). Analysing the complete ACE2 interaction network, we identified 11 genes (ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, CCL2, TFRC, MEP1A, ADAM17, FABP2, NPC1, CLEC4M, TMPRSS2) associated with virus-infection related processes. Previously described genes associated with cardiovascular risk factors DPP4, CCL2 and ANPEP were extensively connected with top regulators of ACE2 network, including ACE, INS and KNG1. Enrichment analysis revealed several disease phenotypes associated with interaction networks of ACE2, heart tissue, and virus-infection related protein, with the strongest associations with the following diseases (in decreasing rank order): obesity, hypertensive disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. We described for the first time microRNAs-miR (miR-302c-5p, miR-1305, miR-587, miR-26b-5p, and mir-27a-3p), which were common regulators of the three networks: ACE2, heart tissue and virus-infection related proteins. Conclusion Our study provides novel information regarding the complexity of signaling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2 and proposes predictive tools as miR towards personalized diagnosis and therapy in COVID-19. Additionally, our study provides a list of miRNAs with biomarker potential in prediction of adverse outcome in patients with COVID-19 and CVD.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wicik, Zofia; Eyileten, Ceren; Jakubik, Daniel; Pav\u00E3o, Rodrigo; Siller-Matula, Jolanta M.; Postula, Marek","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dea6b4bb78101e3d72f8e327646d1ba19004b41.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.094714","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction networks of ACE2","regulators of ACE2 network","ACE2 interactors","ACE2 tissue expression","complete ACE2 interaction network","heart interaction networks","cardiovascular disease","virus-infection related proteins","virus-infection related processes","range of ACE2 expression confidence","main SARS-CoV","heart tissue","coronavirus disease","hypertensive disease","functional networks","disease phenotypes","time microRNAs-miR","COVID","CVD","network medicine","described genes","nervous system networks","coronary artery disease","congestive heart failure","cardiovascular risk factors DPP4","CCL2","ANPEP","cardiovascular systems","patients","shared regulators","common regulators","study","prediction of adverse outcome","risk groups","predictive tools","list of miRNAs","bioinformatic tools","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","obesity","FABP2","following diseases","decreasing rank order","ADAM17","MEP1A","biomarker potential","TFRC","personalized diagnosis","lung","strongest associations","available datasets","NPC1","CLEC4M","complexity","TMPRSS2","Enzyme","novel information","Methods","therapy","pathways","focus","Angiotensin","Conclusion","drug predictions","Enrichment analysis","reference","KNG1"],"language":"en"},

It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses. Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yujun; Wang, Haimin; Tang, Xiaojuan; Ma, Danting; Du, Chengzhi; Wang, Yifei; Pan, Hong; Zou, Qing; Zheng, Jie; Xu, Liangde; Farzan, Michael; Zhong, Guocai","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d984aa88e0341a41d75b65b83d192bbae6d3e644.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","ACE2-Fc variants","receptor ACE2","ACE2 orthologs","ability of SARS","infection of SARS","soluble ACE2","RBD-Fc","host range of SARS","wild animals support entry of SARS","viral entry inhibitors","blocking entry","new viral variants","rabbits","bat coronavirus RaTG13","domestic species","viruses","recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains","etiological agent of coronavirus disease","wide range of domestic","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","animal orthologs","structural insight","uncontrolled pandemic","new human transmission","useful experimental model of COVID","goats","potential intermediate hosts","horses","sheep","cattle","pigs","camels","cats","D30E mutation","course","addition","data","humans","pangolins","residue"],"language":"en"},

The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Sanyi; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Xia, Fan; Li, Tangjuan; He, Sha; Ren, Pengyu; Wang, Xia; Peng, Zhihang; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/160ecaaa5a766c289fc2f6b5499f0dfe7aab971c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan/Hubei/China"],"locations":["Shaanxi"],"keyphrases":["level of case importation","potential case importation","cumulative number of case","stochastic model","local case","stochastic discrete epidemic model","model-based analyses","Shaanxi province","effective reproduction number","important model framework","control reproduction number","large number of individuals","epidemic scale","Hubei province","early deterministic transmission model","complete epidemic data","manageable level","epicenter Wuhan","transmission chains","disease control","small-scale assuming contact tracing","consideration of resumption","quarantined individuals","time transition","Risk analyses","symptom onset time","evaluation of revising travel restriction rules","Poisson distribution","isolation","social-economic activities","intervention strategies","Spring Festival","COVID","effects of intermittent inflow","likelihood of multiple outbreaks","developed methodology","half of cases","provinces","generated infections","lock","China","calculation","compartment","Xian"],"language":"en"},

Such challenges can be potentially resolved if a rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet star is located at the heart of the system, implicating Apep as a Galactic progenitor system to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. One of the difficulties in interpreting the dynamics of Apep is that the spectral composition of the stars in the system was unclear. Here we present visual to near-infrared spectra that demonstrate that the central component of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon- (WC8) and nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes. We argue that such an assignment represents the strongest case of a classical WR\u002BWR binary system in the Milky Way. The terminal line-of-sight wind velocities of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are measured to be $2100 \\pm 200$ and $3500 \\pm 100$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. If the mass-loss rate of the two stars are typical for their spectral class, the momentum ratio of the colliding winds is expected to be $\\approx$ 0.4. Since the expansion velocity of the dust plume is significantly smaller than either of the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion that one of the Wolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic. We can recover a shock-compressed wind velocity consistent with the observed dust expansion velocity if the WC8 star produces a significantly slow equatorial wind with a velocity of $\\approx$530 km s$^{-1}$. Such slow wind speeds can be driven by near-critical rotation of a Wolf-Rayet star.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callingham, J. R.; Crowther, P. A.; Williams, P. M.; Tuthill, P.

METHOD Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P\u003C0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P\u003C0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P\u003C0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P\u003C0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time.

Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19.

Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut, was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. Results: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N=26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID-19\u002B. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P\u003C0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19\u002B were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19\u002B patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P\u003C0.001].

Conclusions: In this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19\u002B tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities.

We found that the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5\u2019 has the strongest propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing nucleotides 23000 \u2013 24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level, while the region upstream varies significantly.

Abstract The recent onset of epidemics caused by viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Lassa, coronavirus, West-Nile encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue, yellow fever and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever alerts about the risk these agents represent for the global health. Chikungunya virus represents a new threat. Surged from remote African regions, this virus has become endemic in the Indic ocean basin, the Indian subcontinent and the southeast of Asia, causing serious epidemics in Africa, Indic Ocean Islands, Asia and Europe. Due to their epidemiological and biological features and the global presence of their vectors, chikungunya represents a serious menace and could become endemic in the Americas. Although chikungunya infection has a low mortality rate, its high attack ratio may collapse the health system during epidemics affecting a sensitive population. In this paper, we review the clinical and epidemiological features of chikungunya fever as well as the risk of its introduction into the Americas. We remark the importance of the epidemiological control and mosquitoes fighting in order to prevent this disease from being introduced into the Americas.","publish_time":"2015-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montero, Antonio","journal":"Medicina Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6385a3de377292b41c20301426169d873898d8e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025775314004576; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775314004576","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Entre","del Caribe"],"organizations":["el Pac\u00EDfico Oriental","Saint Louis"],"locations":["Asia","Africa","Europe"],"keyphrases":["virus chikungunya","Chikungunya virus","fiebre chikungunya y","vigilancia y","oc\u00E9ano \u00CDndico y","casos importados y","este virus entra\u00F1a","human immunodeficiency virus","\u00CDndico y Europa Occidental","chikungunya infection","epidemiological features of chikungunya fever","sus propiedades virol\u00F3gicas y","por los virus \u00C9bola","global health","Americas","su comportamiento dual end\u00E9mico y epid\u00E9mico","esta enfermedad en","principales caracter\u00EDsticas epidemiol\u00F3gicas y cl\u00EDnicas","causando importantes epidemias en \u00C1frica","establecerse recientemente en islas","presencia global","global presence","serious epidemics","Resumen Las epidemias causadas","fiebre amarilla y fiebre hemorr\u00E1gica venezolana han puesto sobre","circulaci\u00F3n local vista en","causar grandes epidemias e instalarse en","lucha contra los mosquitos en su prevenci\u00F3n","dengue","Saint Louis encephalitis","yellow fever","introducci\u00F3n","southeast of Asia","Lassa","coronavirus","Nipah","salud p\u00FAblica global","Am\u00E9ricas","risk","epidemiological control","Indic Ocean Islands","Indic ocean basin","recent onset of epidemics","riesgo que estos agentes representan para","\u00C1frica hacia","entre otros","sus vectores","Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever alerts","Nilo Occidental","health system","serious menace","biological features","West-Nile encephalitis","que ha extendido r\u00E1pidamente su \u00E1rea end\u00E9mica desde regiones remotas","tapete","Pac\u00EDfico Oriental","cuenca","llegando","territorio continental","enfatizando","Marburgo","inmunodeficiencia humana","low mortality rate","high attack ratio","partir","Indian subcontinent","nuevas amenazas destaca","Se revisan","viruses","regi\u00F3n caribe\u00F1a","Ebola","Debido","vectors","agents","order","mosquitoes","Europe","sensitive population","remote African regions","importance","new threat","disease","introduction","paper"],"language":"en"},

Broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts. Vector-borne bacteria of the genus Bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous Bartonella lineages in bats. We assembled a sequence database of Bartonella strains, consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats, and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Bartonella to date. This analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography. We estimate that Bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the radiation of particular Bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts. Bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal-associated Bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus. We conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of Bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders. These results support a \u2018bat seeding\u2019 hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa. Application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites. Significance statement Discovering the evolutionary history of infectious agents in animals is important for understanding the process of host adaptation and the origins of human diseases. To clarify the evolution of the Bartonella genus, which contains important human pathogens, we performed phylogenetic analysis on a broad diversity of Bartonella strains, including novel strains from bats. Our results indicate that Bartonella clades diversified along with their mammal hosts over millions of years. Bats appear to be especially important in the early radiation and geographic dispersal of Bartonella lineages. These patterns are consistent with research indicating a chiropteran origin of important human viruses and eukaryotic parasites, suggesting that bats may play a unique role as historical sources of infections to other hosts.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKee, Clifton D.; Bai, Ying; Webb, Colleen T.; Kosoy, Michael Y.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b0b0f730fbd22ac5857143b28950a28e7b458e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024521","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bartonella"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genus Bartonella","Bartonella genus","numerous Bartonella lineages","evolutionary radiation of Bartonella bacteria","mammal-associated Bartonella","broad diversity of Bartonella strains","comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Bartonella","geographic dispersal of Bartonella lineages","sequence database of Bartonella strains","radiation of particular Bartonella clades","general importance of bats","ancestral hosts","mammal hosts","biogeography of mammalian hosts","animal hosts","important human pathogens","novel strains","early radiation","ancient diversification of mammalian parasites","mammalian orders","mammalian parasite taxa","chiropteran origin of important human viruses","characterized lineages","similar evolutionary patterns","new cultured strains","origins of human diseases","timing of diversification","phylogenetic tools","infecting mammals","spread","results","early geographic expansion","evolutionary history of infectious agents","ancestral reconstruction of host associations","eukaryotic parasites","zoonotic diseases","millions of years","Broad sampling","process of host adaptation","molecular clock","animals","recent surveys","estimation of divergence dates","historical sources of infections","hypothesis","unique role","research","genetic loci","deep influence","notorious reservoirs","eukaryotes","bat seeding","Significance statement","tolerant of infection","Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary","Application","Vector"],"language":"en"},

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraemer, Moritz U.G.; Yang, Chia-Hung; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Klein, Brennan; Pigott, David M.; du Plessis, Louis; Faria, Nuno R; Li, Ruoran; Hanage, William P.; Brownstein, John S; Layan, Maylis; Vespignani, Alessandro; Tian, Huaiyu; Dye, Christopher; Cauchemez, Simon; Pybus, Oliver; Scarpino, Samuel V","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d810f78f8850d9386abc6fdd8d652f2f85191753.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20026708","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["China","spread of COVID","ongoing COVID","human mobility data","drastic control measures","impact of control measures","implementation of control measures","detailed case data","Wuhan","real-time mobility data","spatial distribution of COVID","travel history","travel restrictions","state interventions","unprecedented interventions","human populations","role of case importation","demographics of reported cases","indicative of local chains of transmission","correlation","cities","growth rates","locations","persistence","virus","study","outbreak","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

At present, we don\u0027t have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The findings are presented and discussed by different clinical characteristics.

In Sainte Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recent in vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. Methods: In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ \u002B standard treatment). Conclusion: This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects. R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Objectifs: La pand\u00E9mie mondiale actuelle de COVID-19 a touch\u00E9 environ 2 350 000 personnes et fait plus de 160 000 morts. Nous avons observ\u00E9 dans le GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neurosciences (site Sainte-Anne, Paris, France) une incidence moins importante de formes symptomatiques de COVID-19 chez les patients que dans notre personnel soignant. Notre hypoth\u00E8se est que les traitements psychotropes pourraient avoir une action prophylactique sur le SARS-CoV-2. Cette hypoth\u00E8se est coh\u00E9rente avec les propri\u00E9t\u00E9s antivirales connues de plusieurs psychotropes au premier rang desquels la chlorpromazine (CPZ). En plus de ses effets antipsychotiques classiques, plusieurs \u00E9tudes in vitro ont \u00E9galement d\u00E9montr\u00E9 une activit\u00E9 antivirale de cette ph\u00E9nothiazine via l\u0027inhibition de l\u0027endocytose d\u00E9pendante des clathrines.

Methods We undertook a cross-sectional, online self-reported survey implemented between March 31 and April 5 2020 of Italian physicians. Results Responses were received from 529 physicians, only 13% of which reported to have access to PPE every time they need them. Approximately half of the physicians reported that the information received about the use of PPE was either clear (47%) or complete (54%). Risk perception about contracting the infection was influenced by receiving adequate information on the use of PPE. Access to adequate information on the use of PPE was associated with better ability to perform donning and doffing procedures [OR=2.2 95% C.I. 1.7-2.8] and reduced perception of risk [OR=0.5, 95% C.I. 0.4-0.6].

Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera.

Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed.

Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold for some individual variables of the model. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, we find that they still provide useful insight into the behaviour of estimates from simulations with a range of population sizes, environmental noise, and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV as well as vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Dea, Eamon B.; Park, Andrew W.; Drake, John M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/607233d1f2bfbaaa5b24bd0234c6d1450d44b399.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/247734","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","threshold levels","multiple distance estimates","behaviour of estimates","model","estimation approach","rate of approach","host population","observation schemes","vital dynamics","system\u2019s equilibrium","slow dynamics","average rate","range of population sizes","limit of long-term observation","environmental noise","MERS-CoV","simulations","zoonotic pathogens","susceptible-infected","vaccine-preventable diseases","boundary","SIR","stability","large system","individual variables","measles","parameters","useful insight","deviations","points","transmission","epidemics","results","guidelines"],"language":"en"},

Among all therapeutic approaches, arguments have raised about hydroxychloroquine efficacy in treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to overcome the controversies regarding effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in treatment of COVID-19, using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar and medRxiv pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine. Two authors selected and assessed the quality of studies independently using related checklists. Data have been extracted from included studies and analyzed using CMA v. 2.2.064. heterogeneity was also assessed using I-squared test. Results: Seven studies including four clinical trials and three observational studies have entered into the study. The results of meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that there were no significant differences between patients who received the standard treatment with HCQ regimen and the patients that received the standard treatment without HCQ (RR: 1.44, 95% CI, 0.80-2.59). CT-Scan findings improved in 59% (95% CI 0.15-0.92) and nasopharyngeal culture following RT-PCR resulted negative in 76% (95% CI 0.56-0.89) of patients received hydroxychloroquine. Meta-analysis of observational studies showed 75% (95% CI, 0.54-0.88) of patients were discharged from the hospital, 34% (95% CI, 0.07-0.14) admitted to intensive care unit and 1.5% (95% CI, 0.03-0.83) have expired. Conclusion: This study indicated no clinical benefits regarding HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, further large clinical trials should be taken into account in order to achieve more reliable findings.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shamshirian, Amir; Hessami, Amirhossein; Heydari, Keyvan; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Ghasemian, Roya; Aboufazeli, Elham; Baradaran, Hananeh; Karimifar, Keyvan; Eftekhari, Aida; Shamshirian, Danial","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d831dbf38025a44e0436fd11c52af4db9eb7c5b0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.14.20065276v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMA v.","HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","patients","standard treatment","Meta-analysis of observational studies","results of meta-analysis of clinical trials","quality of studies","large clinical trials","clinical benefits","effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine","hydroxychloroquine efficacy","HCQ regimen","study","systematic search","systematic review","reliable findings","CT-Scan findings","medRxiv pre-print database","Web of Science","Google Scholar","Cochrane Library","available MeSH terms","number of infected individuals","mortality","Scopus","Embase","PubMed","RT-PCR","recent months","nasopharyngeal culture","arguments","account","RR","major global issue","order","Background","Coronavirus Disease","related checklists","significant differences","controversies","therapeutic approaches","intensive care unit","Methods","Conclusion","squared test","authors","CMA","hospital","heterogeneity"],"language":"en"},

This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively. Results: A total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG. One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low.

SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2 protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the ACE2 and FURIN genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between ACE2 variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Mulla, Fahd; Mohammad, Anwar; Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Haddad, Dania; Ali, Hamad; Eaaswarkhanth, Muthukrishnan; John, Sumi Elsa; Nizam, Rasheeba; Channanath, Arshad; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Ahmad, Rasheed; Abubaker, Jehad; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f55764e0911c2c2a28111ff7ad86407f75169dcc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.099176","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran","Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["ACE2 variants","Middle Eastern populations","SARS-CoV","ACE2 gene","Middle Eastern origins","FURIN genes","activating variants","FURIN peptidase","African populations","deleterious variants","European populations","TMPRSS2 protease","N720D","different global populations","K26R","natural variations","new COVID","specific genetic variations","people","S-protein RBD","binding","virus","Kuwait","Qatar","significant correlation","cell receptor","infection","Iran","functionality","exome sequences of individuals","Europeans","pandemic","mortality rates","study","human cells","data","clinical disparity","structural evidence","severity","aggressiveness","viral entry"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the accuracy and limitations of statistical methods to estimate the reproduction number, R0, in the context of emerging epidemics is therefore vital to ensure appropriate interpretation of results and the subsequent implications for control efforts. Using simulated epidemic data we assess the performance of 6 commonly-used statistical methods to estimate R0 as they would be applied in a real-time outbreak analysis scenario - fitting to an increasing number of data points over time and with varying levels of random noise in the data. Method comparison was also conducted on empirical outbreak data, using Zika surveillance data from the 2015-2016 epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean. We find that all methods considered here frequently over-estimate R0 in the early stages of epidemic growth on simulated data, the magnitude of which decreases when fitted to an increasing number of time points. This trend of decreasing bias over time can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about the course of the epidemic or the need for control efforts. We show that true changes in pathogen transmissibility can be difficult to disentangle from changes in methodological accuracy and precision, particularly for data with significant over-dispersion. As localised epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 take hold around the globe, awareness of this trend will be important for appropriately cautious interpretation of results and subsequent guidance for control efforts.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Driscoll, M.; Harry, C.; Donnelly, C.

Here, we report on another risk: the accelerated infectious disease risk associated with the number and geographic spread of human infectious disease outbreaks. Using the most complete, reliable, and up-to-date database on human infectious disease outbreaks (GIDEON), we show that the number of disease outbreaks, the number of diseases involved in these outbreaks, and the number of countries affected have increased during the entire Anthropocene. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of these outbreaks is becoming more globalized in the sense that the overall modularity of the disease networks across the globe has decreased, meaning disease outbreaks have become increasingly pandemic in their nature. This decrease in modularity is correlated with the increase in air traffic. We finally show that those countries and regions which are most central within these disease networks tend to be countries with higher GDPs. Therefore, one cost of increased global mobility and greater economic growth is the increased risk of disease outbreaks and their faster and wider spread.

Sufficient training of healthcare workers (HCWs) in how to manage COVID-19 and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to enable them to do so will be key tools in allowing oPt to mount a credible response to the crisis. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire. Data collection occurred between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcomes was PPE provision and the secondary outcome was HCWs preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of 138 respondents, only 38 HCWs (27.5%) always had access to facemasks when needed and 15 (10.9%) for isolation gowns. The vast majority of HCWs did not find eye protection (n=128, 92.8%), N95 respirators (n=132, 95.7%), and face shields (n=127, 92%) always available. Compared to HCWs in West Bank, those in the Gaza Strip were significantly less likely to have access to alcohol sanitizers (p=0.026) and gloves (p \u003C0.001). On average, governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE measures than non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001). As for preparedness, only 16 (11.6%) surveyed felt confident in dealing with a potential COVID-19 case. With 57 (41.3%) having received any COVID-19 related training and 57 (41.3%) not having a local hospital protocol. Conclusion: HCWs in oPt are underprepared and severely lacking adequate PPE provision. The lack of local protocols, and training has left HCWs confidence exceedingly low. The lack of PPE provision will exacerbate spread of COVID-19 and deepen the crisis, whilst putting HCWs at risk.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alser, O.; Alghoul, H.; Alkhateeb, Z.; Hamdan, A.; Albaraqouni, L.; Saini, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b97bf23442f012adb77b81e033c7d299dcab69c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.09.20096099v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["West Bank","Gaza Strip"],"keyphrases":["HCWs preparedness","HCWs confidence","lack of PPE provision","spread of COVID","potential COVID","vast majority of HCWs","oPt","lacking adequate PPE provision","appropriate PPE measures","related training","access","crisis","pandemic","Sufficient training of healthcare workers","provision of personal protective equipment","lack of local protocols","governmental hospitals","vulnerable healthcare system","non-governmental institutions","local hospital protocol","secondary outcome","occupied Palestinian territory","capacity","alcohol sanitizers","cross-sectional study","Gaza Strip","West Bank","eye protection","primary outcomes","validated online questionnaire","coronavirus disease","credible response","N95 respirators","Methods","Background","average","face shields","key tools","case","respondents","gloves","risk","Conclusion","isolation gowns","Data collection","Results","facemasks"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV first surfaced as a human pathogen in Guangdong, China in November 2002 and rapidly spread worldwide with 8098 cases and 774 deaths before the end of the epidemic. SARS-like CoVs have been detected in horseshoe bats with high sequence homology with human or civet isolates, suggesting that bats could be a natural reservoir of a close ancestor of SARS-CoV. No cases of SARS have been reported since January 2004. MERS-CoV was first reported in September 2012, after it was isolated from respiratory samples from a patient in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia who died in June 2012. How humans acquire MERS-CoV infection is not yet known although bats and dromedary camels are intermediary reservoirs. MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East. As of May 22, 2019, 2428 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization, including 838 deaths (34.5% mortality) have been reported from 27 countries. While the majority of MERS cases occur in the Middle East, travel related MERS cases have been reported from all continents. Large health care associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV have occurred in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. SARS-CoV-2 emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019, and by March 2020 had established as a pandemic which has caused massive disruption in multiple countries. The eventual mortality caused by this virus remains to be seen. All three viruses cause a similar wide range of nonspecific clinical manifestations from mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe respiratory, gastrointestinal and other extra-pulmonary disease. Early recognition of cases, improved compliance with internationally recommended infection control protocols, and rapid implementation of infection control measures are required to prevent health care facility-associated outbreaks, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for control of community spread as well. Treatment is supportive and there are no specific antivirals or vaccines available for both SARS and MERS.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, David S.; Azhar, Esam I.; Memish, Ziad A.; Zumla, Alimuddin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92657652c68474033b9c7e163c9283a362be492f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383116344; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383116344","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization","United Arab Emirates"],"locations":["Middle East","Guangdong","China","Saudi Arabia","Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV cases","cases of SARS","MERS-CoV infection","outbreaks of MERS","related MERS cases","majority of MERS cases","case of SARS","cases of laboratory","close ancestor of SARS","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","respiratory samples","Early recognition of cases","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","recommended infection control protocols","horseshoe bats","Large health care","health care facility-associated outbreaks","Saudi Arabia","control of community","deaths","China","mild upper respiratory tract illness","rapid implementation of infection control measures","World Health Organization","human pathogen","multiple countries","eventual mortality","new lethal zoonotic pathogens of humans","similar wide range of nonspecific clinical manifestations","improved compliance","high sequence homology","years","civet isolates","United Arab Emirates","patient","Jeddah","vaccines available","novel coronaviruses","specific antivirals","natural reservoir","massive disruption","dromedary camels","intermediary reservoirs","extra-pulmonary disease","Republic of Korea","Guangdong","CoVs","pandemic","epidemic","Wuhan","Treatment","continents"],"language":"en"},

Its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has evolved rapidly since its first emergence in December 2019. Mutations in the viral genome have critical impacts on the adaptation of viral strains to the local environment, and may alter the characteristics of viral transmission, disease manifestation, and the efficacy of treatment and vaccination. Using the complete sequences of 1,932 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we examined the genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of aged, new, and frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains, which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents. Mutations in the form of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure, evolutionary process, global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutational history. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatality, and this correlation had strengthened with time, suggesting an important role of SNVs on disease outcomes. This study suggests that SNVs may become an important consideration in virus detection, clinical treatment, drug design, and vaccine development to avoid target shifting, and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pandemic. Significance Statement Mutation is the driving force of evolution for viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19. In this study, we discovered that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly from the originally isolated form. These mutations have been spreading around the world and caused more than 2.5 million of infected cases and 170 thousands of deaths. We found that fourteen frequent mutations identified in this study can characterize the six main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In addition, we found the mutation burden is positively correlated with the fatality of COVID-19 patients. Understanding mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome will provide useful insight for the design of treatment and vaccination.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Hsin-Chou; Chen, Chun-houh; Wang, Jen-Hung; Liao, Hsiao-Chi; Yang, Chih-Ting; Chen, Chia-Wei; Lin, Yin-Chun; Kao, Chiun-How; Liao, James C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9b74b08ea5da70d379995b796eba890cf3e7aea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.055863","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","frequent mutations of SARS","genome of SARS","main clusters of SARS","viral genome","global distribution of mutations","study","design of treatment","phylogenetic clusters","fatality of COVID","adaptation of viral strains","causal agent of COVID","clinical treatment","important role of SNVs","efficacy of treatment","mutation burden","pandemic","vaccination","average mutation count","characteristics of viral transmission","Significance Statement Mutation","drug design","important consideration","disease manifestation","case fatality","disease outcomes","recent history","geographic preference","positive correlation","mutational history","isolated form","form of single nucleotide variations","evolutionary process","haplotype structure","virus detection","driving force of evolution","critical impacts","significant public health issue","temporal distributions of aged","sketch","viruses","Linkage disequilibrium","crucial component","vaccine development","direct interpretation","useful insight","isolation","local environment","infected cases","thousands of deaths","sequencing","target","different continents","fight","time","genomes","complete sequences","addition","patients","world","emergence"],"language":"en"},

Herein, the FEP (free energy perturbation)-based screening strategy is newly derived as a rapid protocol to accurately reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro. Restrain energy distribution (RED) function was derived to optimize the alchemical pathway of FEP, which greatly accelerated the calculations and first made FEP possible in the virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs database. As a result, fifteen out of twenty-five drugs validated in vitro exhibited considerable inhibitory potencies towards Mpro. Among them, the most potent Mpro inhibitor dipyridamole potentially inhibited NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway and inflammatory responses, and has just finished the first round clinical trials.

Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People\u0027s Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients\u0027 first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3\u002BT cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4\u002BT in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8\u002BT in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4\u002B/ CD8\u002B inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia.

To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardia, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xavier, J.; Giovanetti, M.; Adelino, T.; Fonseca, V.; Vitor Barbosa da Costa, A.; Aparecida Ribeiro, A.; Nascimento Felicio, K.; Guerra Duarte, C.; Vinicius Ferreira Silva, M.; Salgado, A.; Teixeira Lima, M.; de Jesus, R.; Fabri, A.; Franco Soares Zoboli, C.; Gutemberg Souza Santos, T.; Iani, F.; Maria Bispo de Filippis, A.; Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira, M.; Luiz de Abreu, A.; de Azevedo, V.; Brock Ramalho, D.; F.

It has been proposed that either the TMDs associate, resulting in the formation of large oligomers of Golgi enzymes, or that they mediate the lateral segregation of the enzymes between lipid microdomains. Evidence for either type of interaction has been sought by examining the retention of sialyltransferase (ST), an enzyme of the mammalian trans Golgi. No evidence could be obtained for specific interactions or \u0027kin recognition\u0027 between ST and other proteins of the trans Golgi. Moreover, it is shown that the previously described kin recognition between enzymes of the medial Golgi involves the lumenal portions of these proteins rather than their TMDs. To investigate further the role of the ST TMD, the effects on Golgi retention of various alterations in the TMD were examined. The addition or removal of residues showed that the efficiency of retention of ST is related to TMD length. Moreover, when a type I plasma membrane protein was expressed with a synthetic TMD of 23 leucines it appeared on the cell surface, but when the TMD was shortened to 17 leucines accumulation in the Golgi was observed. These observations are more consistent with lipid-based sorting of ST TMD, but they also allow for reconciliation with the kin recognition model which appears to act on sequences outside of the TMD.","publish_time":"1995-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munro, S","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC394566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST","ST TMD","TMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medial Golgi","Golgi apparatus","synthetic TMD","TMD length","mammalian trans Golgi","Golgi retention of various alterations","lipid-based sorting of ST TMD","formation of large oligomers of Golgi enzymes","proteins","kin recognition model","resident glycosylation enzymes","efficiency of retention","retention of sialyltransferase","TMDs associate","Evidence","lipid microdomains","leucines accumulation","type of interaction","effects","plasma membrane protein","specific interactions","lumenal portions","removal of residues","lateral segregation","single transmembrane domains","reconciliation","cell surface","addition","observations","sequences","role"],"language":"en"},

Viral antigen localized primarily to infected alveolar macrophages and type-1 pneumocytes by immunohistochemistry. Viral RNA was detected in all animals from pulmonary tissue extracts obtained at necropsy. Viral RNA was also detected in tracheobronchial lymph node and myocardium, together with inflammatory changes, in some animals.

An increasing number of particles are found later inside dense cytoplasmic corpuscles similar to lysosomes. In the cytoplasm of the cells from the samples taken 7 hours after inoculation, two organized structures generally associated and never seen in the controls are observed: one consists of dense material arranged in a reticular disposition (reticular inclusion); the other is formed by small tubules organized in a complex pattern (tubular body).

Mutational analysis of the 106-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of p63 revealed that the NH2-terminal 23 amino acids are necessary for retention.

To identify the targeting signals that mediate this recycling, N- glycosylated and myc-tagged variants of ERGIC-53 were constructed. By monitoring endoglycosidase H resistance, we measured the loss from the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi cycle of ERGIC-53. A domain exchange approach with the plasma membrane reporter protein CD4 showed that the transmembrane and the lumenal domains are not sufficient, while the cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53 is required and sufficient for pre-medial-Golgi localization. However, the ERGIC-53 cytoplasmic domain on CD4 lead to increased ER-staining by immunofluorescence microscopy indicating that this domain alone cannot provide for unbiased recycling through the ER- ERGIC-cis-Golgi compartments. Complete progress through the ER-ERGIC- cis-Golgi recycling pathway requires the cytoplasmic domain acting together with the lumenal domain of ERGIC-53. Dissection of the cytoplasmic domain revealed a COOH-terminal di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, KKFF, and an RSQQE targeting determinant adjacent to the transmembrane domain. Surprisingly, the two COOH-terminal phenylalanines influence the targeting.

These data indicate that strain differences in Ia inducibility, rather than inducibility of class I antigens, by JHM virus may explain higher levels of T cell-mediated damage to myelin during infection in susceptible rat strains compared with resistant strains.","publish_time":"1987-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec0a48de352326aecc319e76ea1f47b989ffcd8f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rat astrocytes","inducibility of class","cultivated astrocytes","Ia inducibility","resistant strains","susceptible rat strains","JHM virus correlates","antigens","JHM viral infection","Inducibility of Ia molecules","oligodendrocytes","Increased expression of class","higher levels of T cell-mediated damage","demyelinating disease susceptibility of animals","consequence of normal cultivation procedures","strain differences","induction","data","mouse"],"language":"en"},

The rapid turnover of ocular surface epithelium and microbial colonization of the eyelids are continual sources of DNA in tears. Here, we determine the principal sources of endonuclease activity in tears. METHODS: Endonucleases in human tears were identified after Sephadex G100 gel filtration. DNA hydrolyzing activity was measured by the conversion pUC19 plasmid DNA to its circular form in agarose gels. Fractions with endonuclease activity were further isolated using a combination ConA-Sepharose DNA, oligo (dT) cellulose, and anion exchange chromatographies. The molecular weights of the DNA hydrolyzing proteins were estimated in zymograms and by calibration of size exclusion chromatography. DNase activities were characterized for activity at a variety of pH and ion concentrations as well as in the presence of inhibitors including NiCl(2), ZnCl(2), G-actin, and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). To determine the mode of hydrolysis, the cleaved ends of the DNA digested by tear DNases were analyzed by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end labeling using either terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or polynucleotide kinase with or without pretreatment with alkaline phosphatase. RESULTS: Tear lipocalin (TL) accounts for over 75% of the DNA catalytic activity in tears while a second endonuclease, ~34 kDa, is responsible for less than 24% of the activity. Both are Mg(2\u002B) dependent enzyme endonucleases that are enhanced by Ca(2\u002B), active at physiologic pH, inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid, and catalyze hydrolysis of DNA to produce 3\u2032-OH/5\u2032P ends. However, the two enzymes can be distinguished by the inhibitory effect of NiCl(2) and the sizes of the cleaved DNA fragments. CONCLUSIONS: Two magnesium dependent extracellular endonucleases were identified in tears that are different from other major human extracellular nucleases. TL is the principal endonuclease in human tear fluid. Tear endonucleases have unique characteristics that differ from other known human endonucleases.","publish_time":"2008-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yusifov, Taleh N.; Abduragimov, Adil R.; Narsinh, Kiran; Gasymov, Oktay K.; Glasgow, Ben J.","journal":"Mol Vis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/308e91d0c4575362a0d169b9ed31c60f79a86437.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2254967.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2254967/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA hydrolyzing activity","hydrolysis of DNA","DNA catalytic activity","human tears","Tear endonucleases","continual sources of DNA","DNA hydrolyzing proteins","cleaved DNA fragments","known human endonucleases","principal sources of endonuclease activity","human tear fluid","conversion pUC19 plasmid DNA","combination ConA-Sepharose DNA","principal endonuclease","dependent enzyme endonucleases","magnesium dependent extracellular endonucleases","Tear lipocalin","tear DNases","major human extracellular nucleases","aurintricarboxylic acid","cleaved ends","TL","physiologic pH","variety of pH","P ends","mode of hydrolysis","inhibitory effect of NiCl","microbial colonization","circular form","cellulose","dT","oligo","zymograms","eyelids","rapid turnover of ocular surface epithelium","polynucleotide kinase","terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase","apoptosis","unique characteristics","Sephadex G100 gel filtration","pretreatment","G-actin","molecular weights","CONCLUSIONS","sizes","calibration of size exclusion chromatography","anion exchange chromatographies","ion concentrations","agarose gels","RESULTS","accounts","OH","PURPOSE","METHODS","alkaline phosphatase","harmful cells","presence of inhibitors","ZnCl","kDa","DNase activities","Fractions","enzymes"],"language":"en"},

We have examined the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on the Golgi-localized synthesis and addition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate side chains. BFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation onto the core proteins of the melanoma-associated proteoglycan and the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain. In the presence of BFA, the melanoma proteoglycan core protein was retained in the ER but still acquired complex, sialylated, N-linked oligosaccharides, as measured by digestion with endoglycosidase H and neuraminidase. The initiation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis was not affected by BFA, as shown by the incorporation of [6-3H]galactose into a protein-carbohydrate linkage region that was sensitive to beta-elimination. The ability of cells to use an exogenous acceptor, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, to elongate and sulfate core protein-free glycosaminoglycans, was completely inhibited by BFA. The effects of BFA were completely reversible in the absence of new protein synthesis. These experiments indicate that BFA effectively uncouples chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan synthesis by segregating initiation reactions from elongation and sulfation events. Our findings support the proposal that glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation reactions are associated with the trans-Golgi network, a BFA-resistant, Golgi subcompartment.","publish_time":"1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b355d4f9adcfca08906339ef42a4990b1e9c8b0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of BFA","BFA-resistant","presence of BFA","chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan synthesis","initiation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis","Golgi complex","addition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate","Golgi-localized synthesis","melanoma proteoglycan core protein","sulfate core protein-free glycosaminoglycans","dose-dependent inhibition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan elongation","sulfation reactions","absence of new protein synthesis","Golgi subcompartment","effects of brefeldin","melanoma-associated proteoglycan","initiation reactions","core proteins","protein-carbohydrate linkage region","sulfation events","trans-Golgi network","major histocompatibility complex class","beta-D","beta-elimination","endoglycosidase H","p-nitrophenyl","exogenous acceptor","digestion","xyloside","functional organization","proposal","galactose","chains","invariant chain","N-linked oligosaccharides","neuraminidase","findings","ability of cells","incorporation","experiments"],"language":"en"},

The respective nucleotide sequences of three Oryx species (Oryx leucoryx, Oryx dammah and Oryx gazella) and an out-group (Addax nasomaculatus) were aligned and subjected to BA, MP and UPGMA models for comparing the topologies of respective phylogenetic trees. The 16S rRNA region possessed the highest frequency of conserved sequences (97.65%) followed by cyt-b (94.22%) and d-loop (87.29%). There were few transitions (2.35%) and none transversions in 16S rRNA as compared to cyt-b (5.61% transitions and 0.17% transversions) and d-loop (11.57% transitions and 1.14% transversions) while comparing the four taxa. All the three mitochondrial segments clearly differentiated the genus Addax from Oryx using the BA or UPGMA models. The topologies of all the gamma-corrected Bayesian trees were identical irrespective of the marker type. The UPGMA trees resulting from 16S rRNA and d-loop sequences were also identical (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx leucoryx) to Bayesian trees except that the UPGMA tree based on cyt-b showed a slightly different phylogeny (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx gazella) with a low bootstrap support. However, the MP model failed to differentiate the genus Addax from Oryx.

These emergencies\u2014which include malignant spinal cord compression, brain metastases, superior vena cava obstruction, and uncontrolled tumour hemorrhage \u2014may require treatment outside of hospital hours, particularly on weekends and hospital holidays. To date, there remains no consensus among radiation oncologists regarding the indications and appropriateness of radiotherapy treatment on weekends, and treatment decisions remain largely subjective. The main aim of the present study was to document the incidence and indications for patients receiving emergency treatment on weekends or scheduled hospital holidays at a single institution. The secondary aim was to investigate the compliance of such treatment with the institution\u2019s quality assurance policies, both local and provincial. METHODS: From September 1, 2002, to September 30, 2004, patients being treated over weekends (defined as commencing at 6 pm on a Friday and concluding at 8 am of the next scheduled workday) and hospital holidays were retrospectively identified using the Oncology Patient Information System scheduling module. Relevant patient data\u2014including patient age, sex, primary cancer site, specific radiation field, rationale for treatment, referring hospital, total treatment dose, radiation dose fractionation, inpatient or outpatient status, and duration of treatment\u2014were collected and subsequently analyzed. Comparison to local policy was performed subjectively. RESULTS: Over the 2-year period, 161 patients were prescribed urgent radiotherapy over a weekend or on a hospital holiday. Of this cohort, 68% were treated on both Saturday and Sunday, 22% on Saturday alone, and 10% on Sunday alone. Most patients presented with lung (31%), prostate (18%), and breast cancer (17%). The top reasons for referral for emergency weekend treatment included spinal cord compression (56%), brain metastases (15%), and superior vena cava obstruction (6%). Most of the indications for treatment generally followed the quality assurance policies implemented both locally and provincially. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated over a weekend or on a hospital holiday were generally found to be treated with appropriate intent. Most treatment indications within this study both complied with provincial policy and showed a pattern of care similar to that seen in other studies in the literature. Local policy appears to be robust; however, policy improvements may allow for more cohesiveness across radiation oncologists in patterns of care in this important group of patients. Comparisons with practice at other institutions would be valuable and also a key step in developing sound guidelines for all members of the radiotherapy community to follow.","publish_time":"2009-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitera, G.; Swaminath, A.; Wong, S.; Goh, P.; Robson, S.; Sinclair, E.; Danjoux, C.; Chow, E.","journal":"Curr Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/271eaab0cdf64e3274bd45a4264eeac8f2d1b0d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2722059.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment indications","emergency treatment","duration of treatment","treatment decisions","emergency weekend treatment","appropriateness of radiotherapy treatment","total treatment dose","weekends","scheduled hospital holidays","hospital hours","management of cancer patients","local policy","important group of patients","radiation oncologists","provincial policy","urgent radiotherapy","radiotherapy community","policy improvements","radiation dose fractionation","specific radiation field","patient age","superior vena cava obstruction","brain metastases","breast cancer","malignant spinal cord compression","institution\u2019s quality assurance policies","primary cancer site","Relevant patient data","important aspect","patterns of care","oncologic emergencies","scheduled workday","present study","main aim","secondary aim","Oncology Patient Information System scheduling module","pattern of care similar","sex","outpatient status","uncontrolled tumour hemorrhage","rationale","cohesiveness","incidence","referral","sound guidelines","key step","members","compliance","consensus","single institution","reasons","practice","institutions","year period","PURPOSE","studies","Comparisons","commencing","lung","CONCLUSIONS","appropriate intent","literature","prostate","RESULTS","date","cohort","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Such an atherogenic lipid profile often predisposes an at risk individual to coronary artery disease with incompletely understood mechanisms. Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is an atypical apolipoprotein. Unlike canonical apolipoproteins that are produced mainly in liver and intestine, apoD is expressed widely in mammalian tissues. ApoD does not share significant degrees of homology in amino acid sequence with other apolipoproteins. Instead, apoD is structurally similar to lipocalins, a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that are responsible for transporting lipids and other small hydrophobic molecules for metabolism. Plasma ApoD is present mainly in HDL and to a lesser extent in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Genetic variants of apoD are associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Increased apoD deposition is detectable in atherosclerotic lesions of humans with established cardiovascular disease as well as mice with premature atherosclerosis. Moreover, apoD is associated with anti-oxidation and anti-stress activities, contributing to lifespan expansion in fruit flies. Elderly subjects and patients with Alzheimer exhibit markedly elevated apoD production in the brain. Thus, apoD is emerged as a significant player in lipid metabolism and aging. Here we focus our review on recent advances toward our understanding of apoD in lipid metabolism and address whether apoD dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. We will also discuss the functional implication of apoD in aging.","publish_time":"2008-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perdomo, German; Dong, H.

The present investigation is an attempt to evaluate the safety profile of the first indigenously developed recombinant DNA anti-rabies vaccine [DRV (100 \u03BCg)] and combination rabies vaccine [CRV (100 \u03BCg DRV and 1.25 IU of cell culture-derived inactivated rabies virus vaccine)], which are intended for clinical use by intramuscular route in Rhesus monkeys. METHODS: As per the regulatory requirements, the study was designed for acute (single dose - 14 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose - 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose - 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels, viz. therapeutic, average (2x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in monkeys. The selection of the model i.e. monkey was based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies. An attempt was made to evaluate all parameters which included physical, physiological, clinical, haematological and histopathological profiles of all target organs, as well as Tiers I, II, III immunotoxicity parameters. RESULTS: In acute toxicity there was no mortality in spite of exposing the monkeys to 10XDRV. In sub chronic and chronic toxicity studies there were no abnormalities in physical, physiological, neurological, clinical parameters, after administration of test compound in intended and 10 times of clinical dosage schedule of DRV and CRV under the experimental conditions. Clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights and histopathology studies were essentially unremarkable except the presence of residual DNA in femtogram level at site of injection in animal which received 10X DRV in chronic toxicity study.

We present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed (using standard parametric and nonparametric techniques) data from the Canadian Travel Medicine Network (CanTravNet) database for ill returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants who presented to a Canadian GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 2009 and September 2011. RESULTS: During the study period, 4365 travellers and immigrants presented to a CanTravNet site, 3943 (90.3%) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis. Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses. Among the 828 immigrants with definitive travel-related diagnoses, the most frequent etiologies were latent tuberculosis (n = 229 [27.7%]), chronic hepatitis B (n = 182 [22.0%]), active tuberculosis (n = 97 [11.7%]), chronic hepatitis C (n = 89 [10.7%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 41 [5.0%]). Potentially serious infections, such as dengue fever (61 cases) and enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi (36 cases), were common. Individuals travelling for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v. 466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p \u003C 0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p \u003C 0.001). Malaria was more likely than other illnesses to be acquired in sub-Saharan Africa (p \u003C 0.001), whereas dengue was more likely than other illnesses to be imported from the Caribbean and South East Asia (both p = 0.003) and enteric fever from South Central Asia (24/36 [66.7%]) (p \u003C 0.001). INTERPRETATION: This analysis of surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers has detailed the spectrum of imported illness within this cohort. It provides an epidemiologic framework for Canadian practitioners encountering ill returned travellers. We have confirmed that travel to visit friends and relatives confers particularly high risks, which underscores the need to improve pretravel intervention for a population that is unlikely to seek specific pretravel advice. Potentially serious and fatal illnesses such as malaria and enteric fever were common, as were illnesses of public health importance, such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B.","publish_time":"2014-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boggild, Andrea K; Geduld, Jennifer; Libman, Michael; Ward, Brian J; McCarthy, Anne E; Doyle, Patrick W; Ghesquiere, Wayne; Vincelette, Jean; Kuhn, Susan; Freedman, David O; Kain, Kevin C","journal":"Open Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22238e30828eb4613d777bea7bd3ff321aae450c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4085092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4085092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Canadian GeoSentinel Surveillance Network"],"locations":["Caribbean","South East Asia","South Central Asia"],"keyphrases":["Canadian travellers","enteric fever","non-immigrant travellers","business travellers","cases of malaria","Canadian Travel Medicine Network","Canadian practitioners","dengue fever","fatal illnesses","definitive travel-related diagnoses","definitive travel-related diagnosis","Canadian GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site","new immigrants","latent tuberculosis","active tuberculosis","illnesses of public health importance","common specific etiologic diagnoses","analysis of surveillance data","Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness","cohort","relatives","CanTravNet site","specific pretravel advice","spectrum of imported illness","chronic hepatitis B","chronic hepatitis C","strongyloidiasis","South East Asia","South Central Asia","pretravel intervention","serious infections","purpose of visiting friends","understanding of migration medicine practice","Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi","frequent etiologies","database","nonparametric techniques","impact of pathogens","arthropod bite","Paratyphi","Important knowledge gaps","need","high risks","population","Caribbean","study period","BACKGROUND","epidemiologic framework","INTERPRETATION","sub-Saharan Africa","known reason","RESULTS","Individuals","overrepresentation","giardiasis","males","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that the peptide P34 exhibited antiviral activity against EAV and FHV-1. The peptide P34 inhibited the replication of EAV by 99.9% and FHV-1 by 94.4%. Virucidal activity was detected only against EAV. When P34 and EAV were incubated for 6 h at 37 \u00B0C the viral titer reduced from 10(4.5) TCID(50) to 10(2.75) TCID(50), showing a percent of inhibition of 98.6%.

Since there is documented resistance to the current drugs used against herpesviruses and there is no treatment for equine viral arteritis, it is advisable to search for new antiviral compounds to overcome these infections.","publish_time":"2014-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, D\u00E9bora Scopel e; de Castro, Clarissa Caetano; Silva, F\u00E1bio da Silva e; Sant\u2019anna, Voltaire; Vargas, Gilberto D\u2019Avila; de Lima, Marcelo; Fischer, Geferson; Brandelli, Adriano; da Motta, Amanda de Souza; H\u00FCbner, Silvia de Oliveira","journal":"Braz J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d97b122ebffbbf28052287cae39cd6c6d3d7cb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4204951.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide P34","P34 inhibited EAV","replication of EAV","FHV","antiviral activity","Virucidal activity","canine distemper virus","equine arteritis virus","canine parvovirus type","canine adenovirus type","canine coronavirus","antimicrobial peptide","equine influenza virus","equine viral arteritis","antiviral properties","feline herpesvirus type","reported antibacterial activity","results","TCID","new antiviral compounds","feline calicivirus","viral titer","Brazilian Amazon basin","FCV","EIV","CDV","infected cell cultures","fish","CAV","CCoV","CPV","current drugs","intestinal contents","strain","Bacillus","treatment","documented resistance","herpesviruses","infections","work","conclusion","percent of inhibition","aim"],"language":"en"},

On March 11, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on February 27, 2020. Methods This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria quantifying. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector) and adjusted for disease importation. Findings By April 11, 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28 - 15.18). Separately for travel related and local cases the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using three-weekly window while adjusting for travel related cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65 -8.41) at day 22 (March 19, 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% CrI: 3.83 -7.88) at day 25 (March 22, 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value at April 11, 2020 was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.26 - 1.58).

The COVID-19 outbreak results from infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. We queried whether the BCG vaccine offers protection against CoV-2 infection. We observed that countries with a current universal BCG vaccination policy have a significantly lower COVID-19 incidence than countries which never had a universal BCG policy or had one in the past. However, population density, median age, TB incidence, urban population, and, most significantly, CoV-2 testing rate, were also connected with BCG policy and could potentially confound the analysis. By limiting the analysis to countries with high CoV-2 testing rates, defined as greater than 2,500 tests per million inhabitants, these parameters were no longer statistically associated with BCG policy. When analyzing only countries with high testing rates, there was no longer a significant association between the number of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants and the BCG vaccination policy. Although preliminary, our analyses indicate that the BCG vaccination may not offer protection against CoV-2 infection.

Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. Methods: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P\u003C0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P\u003C0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01).

Interpretation: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown. Approach \u0026 Results In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108) for the patients without HBV infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause liver function damage in COVID-19 cases and the patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaoping; Jiang, Qunqun; Ma, Zhiyong; Ling, Jiaxin; Hu, Wenjia; Cao, Qian; Mo, Pingzheng; Yang, Rongrong; Gao, Shicheng; Gui, Xien; Xiong, Yong; Li, Jinlin; Zhang, Yongxi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f729b8142b6706f75d7ad9bec583b3591d01b996.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040733","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Aims","HBV","Approach \u0026 Results"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HBV patients","HBV infected patients","enrolled patients","mortality of patients","diagnosis of HBV infection","large group of patients","confirmed COVID","Conclusions SARS-CoV","severe cases","impacts of SARS","laboratory results","pneumonia cases","liver function damage","China","severe disease outcome","higher incidence of liver cirrhosis","Clinical records","clinical characteristics","coronavirus disease","Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University","increased level of total bilirubin","serious public health challenge","mean age","specific treatment strategy","years old","world","retrospective investigation","profound understanding","severity rate","order","Approach","COIVD","females","pandemic","Background","criteria"],"language":"en"},

Current estimates of the mean clinical onset serial interval of COVID-19 range from 3.96 to 7.5 days. In this article, we define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. We study and compare the clinical onset and diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS Analyzing the DS4C project data which summarize information on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 cases reported by regional governments in South Korea, we estimate the means of the clinical onset serial interval, the diagnostic serial interval and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. RESULTS The mean clinical onset serial interval and mean diagnostic serial interval were estimated to be 3.58 days (95% CI: 2.62, 4.53) and 3.68 days (95% CI: 3.14, 4.22), respectively. A matched sample analysis showed that the diagnostic serial interval was significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.17 days, 95% CI: -2.26, -0.09). CONCLUSIONS The short diagnostic serial interval of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea may explain why South Korea was able to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and avoid high mortality.

With limited medical resources, it is a natural strategy, while adopted, to access the severity of patients then determine the treatment priority. However, our work observes the fact that the condition of many mild outpatients quickly worsens in a short time, i.e. deteriorate into severe/critical cases. Hence, it has been crucial to early identify those cases and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients at admission were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared with Chi-square test, Fisher\u0027s exact test, and t test. Both traditional logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the models. Results: The deep learning-based method significantly outperformed logistic regression (AUC 0.954 vs. 0.893). The deep learning-based method achieved a prediction AUC of 0.938 by combining the clinical data and the CT data, significantly outperforming its counterpart trained with clinical data only by 0.141. By further considering the temporal information of the CT sequence, our model achieved the best AUC of 0.954. The proposed model can be effectively used for finding out the mild patients who are easy to deteriorate into severe/critical cases, so that such patients get timely treatments while alleviating the limitations of medical resources.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Xiang; Fang, Cong; Zhou, Yu; Bai, Song; Liu, Zaiyi; Chen, Qianlan; Xu, Yongchao; Xia, Tian; Gong, Shi; Xie, Xudong; Song, Dejia; Du, Ronghui; Zhou, Chunhua; Chen, Chengyang; Nie, Dianer; Tu, Dandan; Zhang, Changzheng; Liu, Xiaowu; Qin, Lixin; Chen, Weiwei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83b15da2e419893a7cc723f81aa35d47696efbd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20037325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mild patients","CT data","mild COVID","severity of patients","clinical data","admission","mild outpatients","critical cases","prediction AUC","deep learning-based methods","CT sequence","follow-up CT","treatment strategy","laboratory data","best AUC","Chi-square test","critical stage","groups","AI model","treatment priority","limitations of medical resources","proposed model","limited medical resources","prediction models","Fisher\u0027s exact test","traditional logistic regression","potential malignant progression","public medical systems","timely treatments","natural strategy","retrospective IRB-approved study","condition","counterpart","short time","coronavirus disease","area","ROC curve","temporal information","fact","total","Results","Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital","worldwide pandemic","Background","work","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative \u2018furin-like cleavage site\u2019 in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogando, Natacha S.; Dalebout, Tim J.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Limpens, Ronald W.; van der Meer, Yvonne; Caly, Leon; Druce, Julian; de Vries, Jutte J.

Bottlenecks in availability of ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may contribute to mortality, implying ethically difficult rationing decisions. It is unclear if accelerated equipment production will meet demand, calling for fallback solutions for life support in worst-case scenarios. Methods: Veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange (VV-ECMO) can provide vital support in bilateral lung failure. VV-ECMO essentially comprises large flow venous accesses, membrane gas exchange, and a blood pump. As thousands of FDA and CE certified Impella blood pumps and consoles are distributed globally for cardiac support, we explored ad-hoc assembly of lean ECMO systems by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes in combination with standard gas exchangers. Results: Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, standard cannulas for large bore venous access, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood/minute is realistic. Benefit/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient requires respiratory support but cannot be supported because of lack of ventilators or unavailability of a required ECMO system. Conclusion: Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs using Impella pumps is feasible and results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules. However, such off-label use of the devices calls for specific ethical and regulatory considerations prior to their use as last resort in patients for whom no other treatment modalities are available.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunziker, P.; Zenklusen, U.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93c689d8ba965b5e63a7f297104c07e01d19bf57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.12.20061929v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","CE","ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Impella pumps","VV-ECMO","gas exchange modules","membrane gas exchange","integration of Impella blood pumps","Veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange","CE certified Impella blood pumps","stable blood flow","assembly of lean ECMO systems","respiratory support","ad","regular ECMO tubing","standard gas exchangers","required ECMO system","venous ECMOs","vital support","life support","cardiac support","large flow venous accesses","large bore venous access","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","assembly of veno","Results","bilateral pneumonia patients","standard cannulas","stable performance","availability of ventilators","respiratory assistance","lack of ventilators","label use","bilateral lung failure","overwhelming intensive care units","consoles","Y-pieces","epidemic","mortality","connectors","tubes","combination","fallback solutions","demand","devices","regulatory considerations","unavailability","thousands of FDA","worst-case scenarios","accelerated equipment production","risk analysis","COVID","Methods","difficult rationing decisions","Benefit","treatment modalities","resort","Bottlenecks","days","Background","minute"],"language":"en"},

Compared to China, other affected countries experienced a longer duration of a slow increase at the early stage and rapid growth at the latter stages. The first apparent increase in the number of affected countries occurred from 23rd Jan to 1st Feb, and the second apparent increase started from 25th Feb. The fist COVID-19 cases reported by countries from 28th Feb. were mainly imported from Europe. The geographic distribution changed from single-center (13th Jan.-20th Feb.) to multi-centers pattern (20th Feb.-14th Mar.). More countries were affected with COVID-19 and developed local transmission. Interpretation: The joinpoint regression and geospatial analysis indicated a multi-center pandemic of COVID-19.

This is paralleled by sex-specific behaviors, with women more likely to adopt a wide range of preventive behaviors. We thus expect behavior to serve as a protective factor for women. Our findings also show a higher level of awareness and concern among older respondents, in line with the evidence that the elderly are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19.

The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Xuefei; Chen, Juan; Hu, Jieli; Long, Quanxin; Deng, Haijun; Fan, Kai; Liao, Pu; Liu, Beizhong; Wu, Guicheng; Chen, Yaokai; Li, Zhijie; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Xiaoli; Tian, Wenguang; Xiang, Jianglin; Du, Hongxin; Wang, Jing; Hu, Yuan; Tang, Ni; Lin, Yong; Ren, Jihua; Huang, Luyi; Wei, Jie; Gan, Chunyang; Chen, Yanmeng; Gao, Qingzhu; Chen, Amei; He, Changlong; Wang, Daoxin; Hu, Peng; Zhou, Fachun; Huang, Ailong; Liu, Ping; Wang, Deqiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","infection","real time RT-PCR detection","IgM","accuracy of real time RT-PCR","healthy sera","factors","respiratory illness","positive rate of IgG","novel coronavirus","accuracy of diagnosis","confirmed patients","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","quality of RNA extraction","outbreak","methods","training of operators","Wuhan city","Hubei province","sampling location","Variations","luminescent immunoassay","pathogens","laboratory test available","China","symptom","diseases","Clinical manifestations","fatal pneumonia","World Health Organization","peptide","Cut-off value","sensitivity","COVID","performance"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections.

Here we use a recently developed phylodynamic approach to uncover phylogenetic structures underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry. Even though Lineages A and B had distinct demographic patterns, they were much more difficult to distinguish.

This has instigated stigma among the general population as the wet market is viewed as a high-risk location for getting infected with coronavirus. Objective This study investigated the prevalence of facemask use among general population visiting the wet market. This study also investigated the demographic factors contributing to unacceptable facemask practice. Setting This prospective observational study was done among visitor to a district wet market selling range of live or freshly slaughtered animals during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods Individuals entering through dedicated entry point were observed for the type, category and practice of wearing personal protective equipment. Inclusion criteria for this study were any individuals entering the wet market. Subjects were categorized into two groups of acceptable and unacceptable facemask practice. The Pearson chi-square was used to test for differences in investigated variables in the univariate setting and Binary Logistic regression model was used in the multivariate setting. Main outcome measure Prevalence, acceptance practice and odds ratio of unacceptance of facemask use. Results Among 1697 individuals included in the final analysis, 1687 (99.7%) was observed wearing facemask with 1338 (78.8%) using medical-grade facemask. Among them, 1615 (95.7%) individuals facemask practice was acceptable while the reaming 72 (4.3%) individuals were observed with unacceptable facemask practice. Individuals using medical-grade facemask and high-risk age group are 6.4 times (OR=6.40; 95% CI, 2.00-20.43; p=.002) and 2.06 times practice (OR=2.06; 95% CI, 1.08-3.94; p=.028). More likely to practice unacceptable facemask use respectively. Conclusion High saturation of facemask among the general population is an adequate indicator of public hygiene measures strategy which can help to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic impact. Alarmingly, the unacceptable facemask practice among high-risk population raises the need for a targeted approach by healthcare authorities to ensure satisfactory facemask use.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunasekaran, G.

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Ka Chun; Cheng, Wei; Zhao, Shi; Ling, Feng; Mohammad, Kirran; Wang, Maggie; Zee, Benny; Wei, Lei; Xiong, Xi; Liu, Hengyan; Wang, Jingxuan; Chen, Enfu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hangzhou","Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["local cases","Shenzhen","Hangzhou","local lockdown","Rt of COVID","higher proportion of imported cases","fewer number of cases","potential of local transmission","unity","local outbreak responses","lockdown measures","different transmission dynamics","Wuhan lockdown","sustained transmission","epidemic of COVID","outbreak response measures","time-varying reproduction number","different intervention periods","similar epidemic trend","transmissibility","variation","Daily aggregated counts","Methods","cities","Credits","Results","disease","Conclusion","accounting","Background","population","likelihood function","study","surge","vs"],"language":"en"},

Fangcang shelter hospitals have been applied in COVID-19 to ease ongoing shortage of medical resources in Wuhan since February 2020. Methods This study enrolled all cases (no=1848) with mild or moderate type of COVID-19 in Fangcang shelter hospital of Jianghan in Wuhan from Feb 5th to Mar 9th, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the National health commission of China. Epidemiological history, comorbidity, vital signs, symptoms and signs were recorded in detail. Laboratory tests included biochemical indicators and nucleic acid tests by throat swabs have been performed as well. Findings A total of 1327 patients reached the criteria of isolation release. Meanwhile, 521 patients have been transferred to the designated hospitals for further treatment, including severe type, fever more than 3 days, and severe comorbidity. The case-severity rate (rate of mild or moderate type transforming to severe type) was 3.0% in the shelter hospital. The patients from mild or moderate type to severe type showed the following clinical characteristics: the median incubation (onset to shelter) period was 10 days; they were all symptomatic at admission; fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms; hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart diseases were common co-morbidities; most of the patients had elevated levels of CRP at ill onset with 33.3% over 10 mg per L; bilateral distribution and ground-glass opacity were the most common manifestations in chest CT. Interpretation The potential risk factors of fever, fatigue, high level of C-reactive protein were the risk factors to identify the progression of COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate type. Fangcang shelter hospitals have substantially reduced the time from the onset of severe symptoms transfer to a designated hospital. Early application of the Fangcang shelter hospital may contribute to decrease the ratio of mild transforming to severe patients.

After adjusting for sex, pre-existing condition, age, SpO2, lesion size, admission data, hospital, and anti-viral medications use, Arbidol and Oseltamivir use is associated with a reduction in mortality. The OR is 0.183 (95% CI, 0.075 to 0.446; p\u003C0.001) for Arbidol and 0.220 (95% CI, 0.069 to 0.707; p=0.011) for Oseltamivir. Compared with patients taking neither Arbidol nor Oseltamivir, the OR is 0.253 (95% CI, 0.064 to 1.001; p=0.050) for patients taking Oseltamivir only; 0.190 (95% CI, 0.076 to 0.473; p\u003C0.001) for patients taking Arbidol only; and 0.030 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.310; p=0.003) for patients taking both, after adjusting for patients characteristics and Lopinavir/Ritonavir use. Similarly, Arbidol is also associated with faster lesion absorption after adjusting for patients characteristics as well as Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir use. CONCLUSIONS Arbidol is able to substantially associated with a reduction in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The combination of Arbidol and Oselmativir may further associated with a reduction in mortality. There is no proven treatment benefit of Lopinavir/Ritonavir.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qibin; Fang, Xuemin; Tian, Lu; Chen, Xianxiang; Chung, Ungil; Wang, Ke; Li, Dan; Dai, Xiyong; Zhu, Qi; Xu, Feng; Shen, Lei; Wang, Bing; Yao, Li; Peng, Peng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8933d3de44a0b88fc3843c05a710e41e84b0b6a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20056523","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lopinavir"],"organizations":["Lopinavir/Ritonavir"],"locations":["Oseltamivir"],"keyphrases":["Oseltamivir use","CI","Information of patients characteristics","Ritonavir use","CONCLUSIONS Arbidol","combination of Arbidol","higher mortality","reduction","antiviral medication use","overall mortality rate","bigger lesion","lesion size","hospitalized COVID","faster lesion absorption","worldwide COVID","cohort","proven treatment benefit of Lopinavir","early admission data","treatment efficacy of selected antiviral medications","hospital stay","Older age","lower SpO2 level","anti-viral medications","presence of pre-existing conditions","chest CT scan","pressing need","effective therapy","BACKGROUND","pandemic","sex","Oselmativir","study objective","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain/Europe. Methods Maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Results Phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019. The origin of S-Spain and G-Spain clusters were estimated in Spain around February 14 and 18, 2020, respectively, with a possible ancestry of S-Spain in Shanghai. Conclusions Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters, with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries. These results highlight the extraordinary potential of SARS-CoV-2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00EDez-Fuertes, Francisco; Iglesias-Caballero, Mar\u00EDa; Monz\u00F3n, Sara; Jim\u00E9nez, Pilar; Varona, Sarai; Cuesta, Isabel; Zaballos, \u00C1ngel; Thomson, Michael M; Jim\u00E9nez, Mercedes; Garc\u00EDa P\u00E9rez, Javier; Pozo, Francisco; P\u00E9rez-Olmeda, Mayte; Alcam\u00ED, Jos\u00E9; Casas, Inmaculada","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70d1510137eeed0e0e6ce2a628e51aba217ffe0e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S.

These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage. In this study, we investigate PPE sterilization using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist(R) equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD), in a sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center. Following one to five sterilization cycles, five N95 mask models from three manufacturers were evaluated using three criteria: efficiency of iHP in sterilization (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies), ability of sterilized masks to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3m, and a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized in the same manner, and pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses. A typical environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, and as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cramer, A.; Plana, D.; Yang, H.

In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2 carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period.

As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19. Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020). We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence. Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among \u226580 year olds. The ASDR (per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death). Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID-19. If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soneji, Samir; Beltr\u00E1n-S\u00E1nchez, Hiram; Yang, JaeWon; Mann, Caroline","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1d71ad230481126fe464e1b8c7be1c7fd790766.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041814","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","ASDR"],"locations":["South Korea","China"],"keyphrases":["number of deaths","low prevalence of COVID","South Korea","ASDR","population-level mortality burden of COVID","current COVID","population-level mortality rates","leading cause of death","causes of death","age-standardized death rate","leading causes","alternative scenarios of increased prevalence","person-years","confirmed cases","year olds","fatality rates","number of laboratory","case distribution","Korean Center","negative binomial regression model","figures","Disease Control","World Health Organization","Prevention","outcome","novel coronavirus","countries","outbreak","Background","offset","Findings","Methods","Interpretation","China"],"language":"en"},

Design: Retrospective manual medical record review. Setting: NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC), a quaternary care academic medical center in NYC. Participants: The first 1000 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: We identified patients with a positive RT-SARS-CoV-2 PCR receiving care at NYP/CUIMC from March 1 through April 15. Patient data was manually abstracted from the electronic medical record. Main outcome measures: We describe patient characteristics including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, outcomes, and disposition. Results: Among the first 1000 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 151 patients were discharged from or died in the ED, 618 were admitted to the floor, and 231 were admitted or transferred to the ICU; 195 remained hospitalized and 172 had died in the hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (62.9%). Compared to Chinese and Italian cohorts, hospitalized patients and ICU patients in particular had more baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity and higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and dialysis. ICU patients were older and predominantly male (67.5%); 75.3% developed AKI and 31.2% required dialysis. Notably, of patients who required mechanical ventilation, only 5.9% were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at 3-4 and 9 days. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness at this medical center faced significant morbidity and mortality, with high rates of AKI, dialysis, and a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset. Patients in this large sample have more baseline comorbidities and more complications than previous Italian and Chinese cohorts.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Argenziano, M.

The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP) residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. Method MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO (via OVID), were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. Results Seventeen articles, three ACLP supported guidelines, and eight online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. Discussion Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to non-mental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimbrean, Paula C.; Ernst, Carrie L.; Forray, Ariadna; Beach, Scott R.; Lavakumar, Mallika; Siegel, Andrew M.; Soeprono, Thomas; Schwartz, Ann C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c82ac523281469f7b43681ffdd461026529ddeb6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033318220301420; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318220301420?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry","CLP","OVID","ACLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developing outpatient CLP rotations","CLP educators","outpatient CLP rotations effective","Discussion Outpatient CLP rotations","outpatient setting","CLP education guidelines","formal outpatient CLP training experiences","psychiatric CLP services","outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry","outpatient medical clinics","recommendations relevant","mental health services","ACLP","residents","programs","residency education subcommittee","published curriculums relevant","non-mental health providers","Academy of Consultation","writing group","ambulatory settings","exposure","therapeutic interventions applicable","trainees","specific clinical scenarios","multiple benefits","increased continuity of care","unique experience","current evidence","examples","MedEd portal","PubMed","Embase","goal","impact","consensus","framework","Abstract Background","future careers","PsycINFO","articles","fellows","psychiatrists","conferences","manuscripts","Method MEDLINE","didactic resources","Results","literature","organization","inception"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control COVID-19 data to predict the number of cases and deaths in COVID-19. According to the our results, while number of cases in Italy and Spain is expected to decrease as of July, in Turkey is expected to decline as of September. The number of deaths in Italy and Spain is expected to be the lowest in July. In Turkey, this number is expected to reach the highest in July. In addition, it is thought that if studies in which the sensitivity and validity of this method are tested with more cases, they will contribute to researchers working in this field.

This gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure. But in recent times, it\u2019s drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts, enabling viruses like SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. Our researchers looked at the ACE2 gene in more than 200,000 people, comparing their exact DNA sequences to see where there are differences among people. Variation in the DNA sequence of a gene is common and is sometimes meaningless. But other times, small changes in the DNA sequence can alter the protein that is made from that gene. In this case the ACE2 gene makes the ACE2 protein, which is what the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with. We found a lot of variation between individuals and checked to see if that variation coincided with any traits (i.e., people with variant X tend to have high blood pressure more often than people without variant X). All of the traits we looked at were non-COVID-19-related traits, meaning we haven\u2019t asked these people anything about COVID-19 yet (this is because these DNA sequences were collected before the pandemic). We found that there are a number of variations observed among people in a specific part of the ACE2 gene. These variations are expected to alter the shape or functionality of a specific part of the ACE2 protein: The part that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We don\u2019t yet know what the real-life significance of this variation is, but it\u2019s possible that these variants decrease the protein\u2019s ability to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus decreasing the person\u2019s likelihood of being infected. We can speculate that there will be a spectrum of vulnerability to COVID-19 among people, where some people are more vulnerable than others, and that variants in this part of the ACE2 gene may be one of the reasons. The research we presented here shines a light on this part of the ACE2 gene and may give future researchers a direction to go in as they try to figure out what makes people vulnerable to COVID-19 and similar viruses.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cirulli, Elizabeth T.; Riffle, Stephen; Bolze, Alexandre; Washington, Nicole L.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40fa2042601a34aa8526dca89902248809747891.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030544","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 gene","ACE2 protein","people vulnerable","sequence of DNA","SARS-CoV","lot of variation","exact DNA sequences","non-COVID","variant X","future researchers","related traits","variants","high blood pressure","lot of attention","similar viruses","recent times","number of variations","small changes","protein\u2019s ability","scientific community","person\u2019s likelihood","shape","look","case","doorway of sorts","spectrum of vulnerability","functionality","direction","real-life significance","role","light","individuals","pandemic","differences","cells","reasons"],"language":"en"},

More than one study reported a significant decrease in acute coronary syndrome admissions during that pandemic which is still due to unknown reasons. Methods This is a retrospective non-controlled multi-centered study of 180 patients (117 males and 63 females) with acute coronary syndrome (STEMI and NSTEMI) admitted during March/April of 2019 and March/April 2020 in Upstate New York. Results A total of 113 patients (61.9% males, 38.1% females) with a mean age of 72.3\u00B114.2 presented during March/April 2019 with ACS (STEMI \u002B NSTEMI) while only 67 (70.1% males, 29.9% females) COVID 19 negative patients with a mean age of 65.1\u00B114.5 presented during the same period (March/April) in 2020.

In NSTEMI patients, 36.4% presented late (\u003E24hours of symptoms) during the COVID 19 pandemic in comparison with 2019 (27.1%, P =.033). Conclusion The COVID 19 pandemic led to a substantial drop by 40.7% (P \u003C.05) of total ACS admissions in our area. This decrease in hospital admissions and late presentations can be a worrisome sign for an increase in future complications of myocardial infarctions.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braiteh, Nabil; Rehman, Wajeeh ur; Alom, Md; Skovira, Vincent; Breiteh, Nour; Rehman, Ibraheem; Yarkoni, Alon; Kahsou, Hisham; Rehman, Afzal","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32db3b15ad9f3430e2fb2e92a9866b90cfd69370.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870320301460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870320301460?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","NSTEMI patients","devastating pandemic","females","total ACS admissions","negative patients","total ACS cases","acute coronary syndrome admissions","hospital admissions","mean age","significant decrease","late presentations","substantial drop","retrospective non-controlled multi-centered study","increase","worrisome sign","virus","future complications of myocardial infarctions","Methods","US healthcare system","Abstract Introduction","area","hours of symptoms","Upstate New York","comparison","Conclusion","unknown reasons","period"],"language":"en"},

As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care. Methods We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community. Results We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies - four each within and outside China - with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rees, E.

Understanding which cell types are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether interspecies differences exist, and how variations in cell state influence viral entry is fundamental for accelerating therapeutic and preventative approaches. In this endeavor, we profiled the transcriptome of nine tissues from a Macaca fascicularis monkey at single-cell resolution. The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 facilitators, ACE2 and TMRPSS2, in different cell subtypes showed substantial heterogeneity across lung, kidney, and liver. Through co-expression analysis, we identified immunomodulatory proteins such as IDO2 and ANPEP as potential SARS-CoV-2 targets responsible for immune cell exhaustion. Furthermore, single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of the kidney unveiled a plausible link between IL6-mediated innate immune responses aiming to protect tissue and enhanced ACE2 expression that could promote viral entry. Our work constitutes a unique resource for understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of two phylogenetically close species, which might guide in the development of therapeutic approaches in humans.

More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

One of the most effective strategies in reducing the severity of the pandemic is social distancing, where members of the population systematically reduce their interactions with others to limit the transmission rate of the virus. However, the implementation of social distancing can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand the potential benefits if done correctly and the risks if not. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the effects of social distancing on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Canada. The model is based upon a standard epidemiological SEIRD model that has been stratified to directly incorporate the proportion of individuals who are following social distancing protocols. The model parameters characterizing the disease are estimated from current epidemiological data on COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The results of the model show that social distancing policies in Canada have already saved thousands of lives and that the prolonged adherence to social distancing guidelines could save thousands more. Importantly, our model indicates that social distancing can significantly delay the onset of infection peaks, allowing more time for the production of a vaccine or additional medical resources. Furthermore, our results stress the importance of easing social distancing restrictions gradually, rather than all at once, in order to prevent a second wave of infections. Model results are compared to the current capacity of the Canadian healthcare system by examining the current and future number of ventilators available for use, emphasizing the need for the increased production of additional medical resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eastman, Brydon; Meaney, Cameron; Przedborski, Michelle; Kohandel, Mohammad","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/913183b16a1731ab6cd455cedb2ee699a30de3fb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20068585v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIRD"],"locations":["China","Canada"],"keyphrases":["social distancing policies","social distancing guidelines","effects of social distancing","social distancing protocols","social distancing restrictions","implementation of social distancing","Model results","mathematical model","model parameters","spread","standard epidemiological SEIRD model","current capacity","current epidemiological data","SARS-CoV","Canada","disease","virus","increased production of additional medical resources","strict policies","thousands of lives","outbreak of SARS","COVID","future number of ventilators available","prolonged adherence","Canadian healthcare system","use","governments","need","vaccine","severity","citizenry","world","time","members","pandemic","importance","policy makers","infecting millions","machine learning techniques","onset of infection peaks","potential benefits","China","population","proportion of individuals","transmission rate","interactions","effective strategies","work","wave of infections","order","risks"],"language":"en"},

In this study, two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus.

As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic\u0027s dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grossmann, G.; Backenkoehler, M.; Wolf, V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a98fffc76d3bb911d18e173b923d12580f89769.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20091736v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stochastic models","ODE-based models","deterministic models","existing ODE-models","ODE-based COVID","complex interaction structures","corresponding mathematical models","recent COVID","spreading dynamics","existence of super-spreaders","contact network","computer simulations","epidemic\u0027s dynamics","underlying contact graph","stochastic multi-agent system","lower death toll","higher infection peak","literature","account","central tools","crucial impact","wrong conclusions","prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions","outbreak data","parameters","pandemic","basic reproduction number R0","healthy individuals","virus propagation","predictive power","political decision-making","fractions of infected","realistic epidemiological insights","evolution","large dependency","effects","instance","time"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. Findings: We included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospital admission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a ~5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses (~1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses). Interpretation: To prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm.

The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because (1) collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and (2) saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wyllie, Anne Louise; Fournier, John; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Campbell, Melissa; Tokuyama, Maria; Vijayakumar, Pavithra; Geng, Bertie; Muenker, M.

By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases. Methods This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients. Results 34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1*109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P\u003C0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases. Conclusion Imported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Puyu; Ren, Guoxia; Yang, Jun; Li, Zhiqiang; Deng, Shujiao; Li, Miao; Wang, Shasha; Xu, Xiaofeng; Chen, Fuping; Li, Yuanjun; Li, Chunyan; Yang, Xiaohua; Xie, Zhaofeng; Wu, Zhengxia; Chen, Mingwei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2b838658be5e902e595ebd2ec515da4f2cacf75.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071472v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["second-generation cases","non-severe cases","initial cases","pneumonia cases","first-generation cases","median lymphocyte count","Wuhan","Baseline lymphocyte count","survived patients","confirmed COVID","sequelae of COVID","mortality of COVID","median age","level","median interval","Pulmonary fibrosis","death case","non-survivor case","better prognosis","clinical characteristics","multicenter cohort study","DBIL","LDH","ESR","CRP","hospital admission","outcome data","symptom onset","HBDH","difference","later chest CT images","Methods","retrospective","medical records","IQR","survivors","dynamic laboratory findings","downtrend","Conclusion","cities","countries","years","regions","days","reports","Results","complications","condition","account"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression, putative functions, and transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung specimens. Single cell RNA-Seq data indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in the key protective cell types including the goblet and ciliary epithelial cells, as well as in the endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. A novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites identified several putative sites for determined transcription factors within the ACE2 gene promoter. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barker, Harlan; Parkkila, Seppo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad1cd585369f341d55bb495410abbfda1b746693.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.038752","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 gene promoter","regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression","higher levels of ACE2","putative sites","cell-specific expression","COVID","endothelial cells","ciliary epithelial cells","human target cells","positive signals","key protective cell types","putative functions","transcription factors","moderate signals","classical role","significant role","small intestine","transcriptional regulation","large intestine","novel tool","lung specimens","Single cell RNA-Seq data","prediction of transcription factor","renin-angiotensin system","World Health Organization","Gene ontology analysis","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","public health emergency of international concern","respiratory tract","goblet","epidemic","testis","kidney","enzyme","age","gender","angiogenesis","blood vessel morphogenesis","number of bioinformatics tools","results","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource limited environments. Findings We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics which are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences, and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalantar, Katrina L.; Carvalho, Tiago; de Bourcy, Charles F.A.; Dimitrov, Boris; Dingle, Greg; Egger, Rebecca; Han, Julie; Holmes, Olivia B.; Juan, Yun-Fang; King, Ryan; Kislyuk, Andrey; Mariano, Maria; Reynoso, Lucia V.; Cruz, David Rissato; Sheu, Jonathan; Tang, Jennifer; Wang, James; Zhang, Mark A.; Zhong, Emily; Ahyong, Vida; Lay, Sreyngim; Chea, Sophana; Bohl, Jennifer A.; Manning, Jessica E.; Tato, Cristina M.; DeRisi, Joseph L.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/710bfb8052f2c32456a6a05f8e21b69a2d65e6e8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030551","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Metagenomic"],"locations":["Cambodia","China"],"keyphrases":["IDseq analysis","raw mNGS data","data interpretation","IDseq Portal","Existing mNGS data analysis tools","mNGS datasets","present IDseq","novel pathogens","global pathogen detection","unbiased detection","hypothesis generation","generation sequencing","novel virus detection capability","environmental background model generation","pathogen-specific reagents","assembly-based alignment pipeline","Background Metagenomic","specific intent","microbial composition","microbial landscape","taxonomic categories","open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline","quality filtration steps","intensive processing steps","nasopharyngeal swab sample","taxonomic relative abundances","service","automatic internal spike","bioinformatics expertise","access","barrier","evolved viral sequences","bioinformaticians","identification of microbes","real-world samples","host","bench scientists","series","local server-class hardware resources","entry","control recognition","obstacle","clinicians","statistics","easy-to-use web application","knowledge","assignment","culturing","insight","monitoring","China","tourist","Wuhan","resource limited environments","contigs","Cambodia","Findings","Conclusion","emergent SARS-CoV","research laboratories"],"language":"en"},

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital\u2032s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of \u003E5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of \u003E500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (\u003E10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Bicheng; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Qiu, Yanru; Feng, Fan; Feng, Jia; Jia, Yifan; Zhu, Hengcheng; Hu, Ke; Liu, Jiasheng; Liu, Zaiming; Wang, Shihong; Gong, Yiping; Zhou, Chenliang; Zhu, Ting; Cheng, Yanxiang; Liu, Zhichao; Deng, Hongping; Tao, Fenghua; Ren, Yijun; Cheng, Biheng; Gao, Ling; Wu, Xiongfei; Yu, Lilei; Huang, Zhixin; Mao, Zhangfan; Song, Qibin; Zhu, Bo; Wang, Jun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a625e5d6fc8956c231c500a40e887e248a69de61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["death cases laboratory","bulk of death cases","cardiac failure","Respiratory failure","renal failure","leading cause of death","SARS-CoV","hemorrhage","detected patients","renal damage","severe disease","half of dead patients","Wuhan local hospital","local residents of Wuhan","hepatic","initial symptom","high neutrophil","Median time","high level of IL","infection","years","heart disease","cerebrovascular disease","Methods Clinical data","main cause of COVID","clinical characteristics","aspartate aminotransferase","alanine aminotransferase","median age","severe illness","high systemic immune-inflammation index","Conclusion Older males","cytokine release storm mediated damage","designed standardized data collection forms","increased C-reactive protein level","s electronic medical records","organ","virus","comorbidities","significant association","days","MOF","lymphocyte ratio","great proportion","pneumonia","Findings","comorbidity","lymphopenia","sepsis syndrome","single center","diabetes","IQR","lactate dehydrogenase","D-dimer","admission","neutrophilia","hypertension","pg","Background","China","world","cancer","thrombocytopenia"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to collate and summarize all published systematic reviews on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO\u0027s Global Research, LILACS and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory and radiological findings) and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). Meta-analysis on prevalence of clinical outcomes was performed. Results: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty. Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of 13 reviews was rated as \u0022critically low\u0022, one as \u0022low\u0022, one as \u0022moderate\u0022 and two as \u0022high\u0022. Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8-12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a frequent pattern of uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%. Conclusions: Confidence in the results of most reviews was \u0022critically low\u0022. Future studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodologies. The majority of included systematic reviews were hampered by imprecise search strategy and no previous protocol submission.

Abstract Introduction Advances in molecular diagnosis have made it possible to detect previously unknown viral agents as causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The frequency and relevance of viral coinfections is still debatable. Objective compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. Methods A 3-year period observational study (2012-2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. Results The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85,5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35,5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission.

However, relying on national reports is problematic because classification and estimation of COVID-19 mortality are not consistent across countries. Likewise, delay coronavirus test results and shortage of testing kits can result in undercounting of coronavirus deaths. To overcome these problems, this study exploits all cause daily death registrations data provide by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) from 1st January to 4th April 2020. This allows us to: 1) calculate excess mortality in 2020 compared to the years 2015 to 2019; and 2) estimate life expectancy on a seasonal and annual basis. We focus our analysis on Bergamo and Brescia, the two hardest hit provinces in Lombardy, northern Italy. Given the clustering nature of the epidemic, focusing on the areas with high concentration of severe illness and deaths allows us to capture the true impact of COVID-19 on mortality and life expectancy, which are likely to be underestimated in the national level data. We find that on the period 1 Jan to 4 April 2020, seasonal life expectancy in Bergamo reduced by around 8.1 and 6.5 years compared to 2019 for men and women respectively (4.5 and 3.4 years in Brescia). The drop in period life expectancy for 2020 may total up to 3 years in the case of men and 2 years in the case of women. Such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the Second World War. This study shows that, in the absence of public health interventions to reduce the spread of the virus, COVID-19 has set life expectancy in Bergamo and Brescia back to the Italian life expectancy of 15 years ago.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghislandi, S.; Muttarak, R.; Sauerberg, M.; Scotti, B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/426ab98804aff190446c09d8b56cac00546042cf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.29.20084335v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bergamo"],"keyphrases":["years","Italian life expectancy","seasonal life expectancy","period life expectancy","human life","Brescia","Bergamo","estimation of COVID","national reports","true impact of COVID","national official reports","national level data","study","case of men","excess mortality","case of women","undercounting of coronavirus deaths","population health","Italian Statistical Office","delay coronavirus test results","absence of public health interventions","cause daily death registrations data","shortage of testing kits","hardest hit provinces","areas","Lombardy","high concentration of severe illness","spread","classification","northern Italy","modern history","Existing studies","annual basis","epidemic","World War","ISTAT","sharp decrease","drop","clustering nature","problems","countries","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Objective: Summarized the latest epidemiological changes, clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination and pathological characteristics of COVID-19. Evidence Review: PubMed database were searched from 2019 to 2020 using the index terms novel coronavirus or COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 and synonyms. Articles that reported clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were included and were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics. Results: 34 COVID-19-related articles were eligible for this systematic review;Four of the articles were related to pathology. We found that Fever (86.0%), cough (63.9%) and Malaise/Fatigue (34.7%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way. The mortality rates of COVID-19 were 2.5%, and the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 was 3.9%. We also found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as ARDS. But the latest pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous secretions in the lungs.

This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal\u2013orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.","publish_time":"2002-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koopmans, Marion; von Bonsdorff, Carl-Henrik; Vinj\u00E9, Jan; de Medici, Dario; Monroe, Steve","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eb89ef1b9b8c83821dc226c368a9cf07e663614.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168644502000967; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168644502000967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NLV","HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foodborne viruses","outbreaks of foodborne infections","detection of viruses","virus outbreaks","HAV","transmitted viruses","reports of foodborne transmission","burden of illness","contamination of food","food processing","food item","greatest risk of foodborne transmission","foodborne outbreak results","causes of illness","research of NLV","detection of common source outbreaks","vast outbreaks","concurrent increase","infected person","typing information","virological information","hepatitis","high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness","Little information","single source","worldwide availability of high-risk food","decreasing population","molecular tracing of virus strains","development of molecular methods","aging population","established methods","rapid detection system","waterborne viral infections","preventive measures","single foodhandler","following hygienic control measures","available routine","certain foods","lack of culture systems","combined laboratory","consumption patterns","immune individuals","disinfection","changes","Norwalk","amplification","fomites","caliciviruses","bacterial pathogens","better surveillance","lesser extent","efforts","problem","elderly","feces","Recent advances","issue","vomit","humans","shellfish","People","symptoms","Studies","spread"],"language":"en"},

Such a high fatality rate suggests that trials should focus on survival and have follow-up of at least one month.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giorgi Rossi, P.; Ferroni, E.; Spila Alegiani, S.; Leoni, O.; Pitter, G.; Cereda, D.; Marino, M.; Pellizzari, M.; Sultana, J.; Trifiro\u0027, G.; Massari, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/653477dd9925ad9e4b09ea9e4819e9f6cf9dc538.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20103119v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kaplan Meier"],"organizations":["Charlson","SARS CoV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","younger patients","population-based survival curves of hospitalized COVID19 patients","COVID19 registries","COVID19 interventions","lower survival","comorbidities","Kaplan Meier survival estimates","days of hospitalization","Background COVID19 case fatality rate","sex","Patients\u0027 median age","month","trials","median follow-up","IQR","Charlson Index","positive SARS CoV","high fatality rate","cohort study","reliable estimates specific","RTPCR test","hospital discharge databases","studies","countries","Reggio Emilia","patient clinical histories","Lombardy","Veneto","older ones","nasopharyngeal swabs","years","setting","areas of Northern Italy","females","Findings","Methods","death","infection","Interpretation","total"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was seeded with New Zealand (NZ) population data and relevant parameters sourced from the NZ and international literature. Results: For what we regard as the most plausible scenario with an effective reproduction number of 2.0, the results suggest that 95% of outbreaks from a single imported case would be detected in the period up to day 33 after introduction. At the time point of detection, there would be a median number of 6 infected cases in the community (95%UI: 1-68). To achieve this level of detection, an on-going programme of 7,800 tests per million people per week for the NZ population would be required. The vast majority of this testing (96%) would be of symptomatic cases in primary care settings and the rest in hospitals. Despite the large number of tests required, there are plausible strategies to enhance testing yield and cost-effectiveness eg, (i) adjusting the eligibility criteria via symptom profiles; (ii) and pooling of test samples. Conclusions: This model-based analysis suggests that a surveillance system with a very high level of routine testing is probably required to detect an emerging or re-emerging SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within one month of a border control failure in a nation.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, N.; Schwehm, M.; Verrall, A.

One such proposed mechanism is androgen regulation of pulmonary TMPRSS2, the host co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We find no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide does not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, regardless of sex, smoking significantly increases the expression of TMPRSS2, which reverts back to never-smoker levels in former smokers. Finally, we show that in mouse models, despite equivalent AR transcript levels, males express markedly higher amounts of AR protein. If a similar sex-specific regulation of AR protein occurs in human lung, androgens could play important roles in clinical outcome of COVID-19 through mechanisms other than TMPRSS2 regulation.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baratchian, Mehdi; McManus, Jeffrey; Berk, Mike; Nakamura, Fumihiko; Erzurum, Serpil; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Drazba, Judy; Peterson, John; Gaston, Ben; Sharifi, Nima","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/080096f4b8a900929edb855fb9e39c6c6565e221.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.051201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TMPRSS2 regulation","expression of TMPRSS2","pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression","androgen regulation of pulmonary TMPRSS2","increased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression","higher amounts of AR protein","similar sex-specific regulation of AR protein","SARS-CoV","subsequent COVID","androgen-driven mechanisms","equivalent AR transcript levels","androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide","clinical outcome of COVID","lungs of males","Higher morbidity","smoker levels","male mice","host co-receptor","recent emergence of SARS","important roles","androgens","human lung","treatment","pandemic","mouse models","proposed mechanism","females","mortality of men","evidence","public health crisis","humans","smokers"],"language":"en"},

Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown (self-reported). Results: Most (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before the epidemic.

Within this model, we investigate the effect of a heterogeneous network topology and a heterogeneous subpopulation size distribution.

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19\u002B), and among Covid-19\u002B subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19\u002B among all who tested. Among Covid-19\u002B we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19\u002B. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19\u002B (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46). In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] \u003E3.25 OR 8.73, 95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19\u002B, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19\u002B, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rentsch, Christopher T.; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Tate, Janet P.; Park, Lesley S.; King, Joseph T.; Skanderson, Melissa; Hauser, Ronald G.; Schultze, Anna; Jarvis, Christopher I.; Holodniy, Mark; Lo Re, Vincent; Akgun, Kathleen M.; Crothers, Kristina; Taddei, Tamar H.; Freiberg, Matthew S.; Justice, Amy C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACS Index"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Covid","intensive care","laboratory measures","subsequent hospitalization","risk of hospitalization","Demographic data","independent associations","laboratory abnormalities","Laboratory tests","vital signs","comorbid conditions","Limited data","infection","analyses conditional","coronavirus disease","United States","clinical factors","black race","VACS Index","patients","national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System","largest integrated healthcare system","conditional multivariable logistic regression","medication history","available characterizing SARS-Cov","electronic health record data","unadjusted analyses","adjusted models","adjusted analysis","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","prior medication exposure","comorbidities","substance use","multiple imputation of missing values","validated summary measure of physiologic injury","Participants","Importance","fibrosis","Retrospective cohort study","C-statistic","Setting","site","score","Conclusions","Relevance","Exposures","medications","Design","cases","adjustment","Main Outcomes","increase","Objective","evolving pandemic","Results","years"],"language":"en"},

Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak. It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males. Methods: From January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen. Findings: The age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples. Another died patient was 67 years old, who died in March 10, 2020 and tissue sample via testicular biopsy was tested negative for viral RNA. Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the semen or testicular biopsy specimen.

Methods: We recruited 32 patients who had 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19; 18 hospitalized and actively symptomatic, 14 recovered mild cases), and measured levels of IgM (against the full-length S1 or the highly homologous SARS-CoV E protein) and IgG (against S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]). We performed the same analysis in 103 pre-2020 healthy adult control (HC) participants and 13 participants who had negative molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were very elevated within days of symptom onset for hospitalized patients (median 2.04 optical density [OD], vs. 0.12 in HC). People who recovered from milder COVID-19 only reached similar IgG levels 28 days after symptom onset. IgM levels were elevated early in both groups (median 1.91 and 2.12 vs. 1.14 OD in HC for anti-S1 IgM, 2.23 and 2.26 vs 1.52 in HC for anti-E IgM), with downward trends in hospitalized cases having longer disease duration. The combination of the two IgM levels showed similar sensitivity for COVID-19 as IgG but greater specificity, and identified 4/10 people (vs. 3/10 by IgG) with prior symptoms and negative molecular testing to have had COVID-19. Conclusions: Disease severity and timing both influence levels of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, with IgG better for early detection of severe cases but IgM more suited for early detection of milder cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ozturk, T.; Howell, C.; Benameur, K.; Ramonell, R.

However, the global genetic diversity and transmissions are still unclear. Methods: 3050 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from GIASID database. After aligned by MAFFT, the mutation patterns were identified by phylogenetic tree analysis. Results: We detected 17 high frequency (\u003E6%) mutations in the 3050 sequences. Based on these mutations, we classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups. We found that group A was mainly presented in Asia, group B was primarily detected in North America, group C was prevailingly appeared in Asia and Oceania and group D was principally emerged in Europe and Africa. Additionally, the distribution of these groups was different in age, but was similar in gender. Group A, group B1 and group C2 were declined over time, inversely, group B2, group C3 and group D were rising. At last, we found two apparent expansion stages (late Jan-2020 and late Feb-2020 to early Mar-2020, respectively). Notably, most of groups are quickly expanding, especially group D. Conclusions: We classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups based on different mutation patterns at first time. The distribution of the 10 subgroups was different in geography, time and age, but not in gender. Most of groups are rapidly expanding, especially group D. Therefore, we should attach importance to these genetic diversity patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and take more targeted measures to constrain its spread.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Z.-w.; Li, Z.; Li, H.; Ren, H.; Hu, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c59dec814773b33d226a3eecef31113b07140174.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20091413v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","North America","Asia","Oceania","Europe","Africa"],"keyphrases":["group D","group B2","group C3","group C2","group B1","SARS-CoV","main groups","genetic diversity patterns of SARS","time","subgroups","different mutation patterns","Asia","distribution","gender","mutations","global genetic diversity","genome sequences","substantial health emergency","economic stress","epidemic","North America","transmissions","geography","phylogenetic tree analysis","world","apparent expansion stages","GIASID database","importance","Europe","Oceania","high frequency","targeted measures","Results","spread","MAFFT","China","Methods","Conclusions","Africa","Background"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable \u201Cchoke points\u201D for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle.

Tracking these events across a birth cohort during their first five years, we demonstrate that \u003E80% of infectious events indeed involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) towards dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change in NPM frequently precedes the appearance of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. In non-sensitized children these events are associated only with \u201Ctransient wheeze\u201D that resolves after age three. In contrast, in children developing early allergic sensitization, they are associated with ensuing development of persistent wheeze, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype.

Genome science is heavily driven by new technological advances that allow for rapid and inexpensive collection of various types of data. The emergence of genomic science has not simply provided a rich set of tools and data for studying molecular biology. It has been the catalyst for an astounding burst of interdisciplinary research, and it has challenged long-established hierarchies found in most institutions of higher learning. The next generation of biologists needs to be as comfortable at a computer workstation as they are at the lab bench. Recognizing this fact, many universities have already reorganized their departments and their curricula to accommodate the demands of genomic science.The chapter discusses practical applications and uses of genomic data.

We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantified (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas are potentially less able to meet social distancing requirements while in parks during periods of high use. Cities in England and Wales can provide residents with access to green space that enables outdoor exercise and play during social distancing. Keeping public parks and gardens open, might require measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shoari, N.; Ezzati, M.; Baumgartner, J.; Malacarne, D.; Fecht, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20098269v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Wales"],"keyphrases":["public parks","number of parks","park crowdedness","nearest park","dedicated park times","gardens open","social distancing requirements","urban areas of England","total number of people","Wales","periods of high use","residents","mental health impacts of social distancing","metres of urban postcodes","higher share of flats","green space","capita space","distance of postcodes","different age groups","entry allocation systems","outdoor exercise","Office","National Statistics","average","measures","potential","ten-minute walk","Ordnance Survey","smartphone apps","data","drones","variability","city","spread of COVID","availability","Cities","accessibility","children"],"language":"en"},

The disease has quickly spread and reached multiple cities within a few weeks. In an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the government has implemented strict regulations. Starting March 15th, all travelers coming back to the kingdom were tested for COVID-19 and were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The same rule was applied to all positive cases identified by contact tracing. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals in a quarantine facility in the eastern province. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study on 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects who were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The study period was from March 16th until April 18th, 2020. We collected data on demographics and on clinical symptoms. Also, samples for PCR tests were collected upon admission and were repeated every 72 hours if they were still positive. All negative samples were repeated within 24 hours for confirmation. RESULTS Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI,12.4-21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7-13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P=0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is high in our study. Testing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell was the most common presentation in our mild symptomatic residents, and it might be predictive of mild disease. The persistent positive PCRs observed in the mild asymptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alshami, A.

Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 \u03BCM and 0.04 \u03BCM respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 \u03BCM and 0.33 \u03BCM, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 \u00C5 resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of Mpro. Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Wenhao; Zhang, Bing; Jiang, Xia-Ming; Su, Haixia; Li, Jian; Zhao, Yao; Xie, Xiong; Jin, Zhenming; Peng, Jingjing; Liu, Fengjiang; Li, Chunpu; Li, You; Bai, Fang; Wang, Haofeng; Chen, Xi; Cen, Xiaobo; Hu, Shulei; Yang, Xiuna; Wang, Jiang; Liu, Xiang; Xiao, Gengfu; Jiang, Hualiang; Rao, Zihe; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Xu, Yechun; Yang, Haitao; Liu, Hong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aafe0afc46c28bd52f9cf5a1701d5771a2236aa3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.996348","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCM","potent anti-SARS-CoV","lead compounds","Cys145 of Mpro","key CoV enzyme","X-ray crystal structures of SARS","COVID","promising drug leads","attractive drug target","Specific antiviral drug","infection activity","EC50 value","IC50 value","excellent inhibitory activity","pivotal role","cell-based assay","clinical potential","transcription","viral replication","covalent inhibitors","low toxicity","etiological agent responsible","aldehyde groups","outbreak","good PK properties","main protease","complex","studies","Wuhan","\u00C5 resolution","effort","infections"],"language":"en"},

There is no specific treatment or vaccine identified and the focus has been preventive measures based on statistical and mathematical models. These have relied on analyzing the behavior of populations and characteristics of the infection and applying modelling techniques. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth. Data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 in three selected countries, Sri Lanka, Italy and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 20th April 2020. In this study Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries. Akaikes information criteria (AIC) was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated. Log incidences over time in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreaks of countries. Hence, doubling time/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were estimated. Findings altogether demonstrate that outbreak seems extinct in Hebei-China whereas further transmissions are possible in Sri Lanka. In Italy, current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate.

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4\u002B Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, Ryan D.; Chen, Sidi","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56816e072e2af57957c7c6dcbbccd714463004bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tcm"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["age-associated genes","age-associated factors","age-associated changes","SARS-CoV replication","relative SARS-CoV","age-associated gene expression","aging lung","emergence of SARS","mortality of COVID","heightened severity of COVID","aging human lung","Lung epithelial cells","cell populations","older populations","Tcm cells","Th1 cells","abundance","Epidemiologic studies","Coronavirus Disease","single-cell transcriptomics","strongest risk factors","mitochondrial activity","experimental data","functional effects","integrative analysis of bulk","host interactions","cellular landscapes","vascular smooth muscle contraction","CD4","morbidity","fibroblasts","pericytes","macrophages","relationship","decreased lipid metabolism","pathogenesis","transcriptional features","potential avenues","analyses","strategies","proteome","infection","globe"],"language":"en"},

This article establishes an epidemic spread relationship network between Hong Kong and various countries and regions around the world and build a regression model based on network information to fit Hong Kong\u0027s COV-19 epidemic growth data. The results show that the regression model based on the relationship network can better fit the existing cumulative number growth curve.

Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are frailer, and therefore more susceptible or more exposed, have higher probabilities of being infected, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection, and thus intensifying the deceleration in occurrence of new cases. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, herd immunity is attained. Although estimates vary, it is currently believed that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune.

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA\u0027s stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand in NY has subsided.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehrotra, S.; Rahimian, H.; Barah, M.; Luo, F.; Schantz, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7de80e0cf4a4af961da80e7721b1d4cf56e8329.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.02.20051078v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Federal Emergency Management Agency","FEMA","U.S. Department of Homeland Security"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak demand","different states","available ventilator inventory","different times","patients","non-COVID","peak shortfall","allocation of ventilator inventory","different entities peaks","initial inventory","ventilator days","additional ventilators","total shortfall","severe demand scenario cases","pandemic","NY","critical resource","various degrees of shortfall","central agency","extreme case","stochastic optimization model","Federal Emergency Management Agency","Department of Homeland Security","forecast confidence interval","average","FEMA\u0027s stockpile","risk-averse condition","quartile","paper","planning horizon","projected needs","results","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The empirical validation parameters specificity (inclusivity/exclusivity), quantitative phase analysis (10-106 copies), reliability (repeatability/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection/quantification limits) were evaluated for a minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK). Results The GPS\u2122 RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions The GPS\u2122 CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation, represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic was declared. The analysis suggested the GPS\u2122 CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test is the more exclusive by far.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Murcia, Antonio; Bru, Gema; Navarro, Aaron; Ros-T\u00E1rraga, Patricia; Garc\u00EDa-Sirera, Adri\u00E1n; P\u00E9rez, Laura","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93b885af3e32be51e6a885b8af4905e96a6dac8a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.065383","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background The Corona Virus Disease","UNE/EN ISO","ISO/IEC","Public Health England","UK"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["dtec-RT","qPCR Test","RT-qPCR primers","COVID","RT-qPCR designs","Diagnostic validation","kit GPS","parameters of validation","additional SARS-CoV","empirical validation parameters specificity","diagnostic sensitivity","reference methods","closet related non-SARS-CoV","silico specificity","independent reference laboratories","pandemic","Results","human health","following criteria","genome sequence","EN ISO","Public Health England","strict acceptance criteria","quantitative phase analysis","serious infectious disease","specific detection method","Corona Virus Disease","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","inclusivity","exclusivity","highest number of mismatches","PHE","Colindale","Instituto","probe","ISCIII","Spain","Salud Carlos","London","copies","repeatability","case of efficient transfer of technology","reproducibility","UNE","present study","evaluation","quantification limits","reliability","UK","Madrid","days","minimum","Objectives","kits","Conclusions","assays","IEC","indels"],"language":"en"},

Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix \u03B11 of human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding.

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diao, Bo; Wen, Kun; Chen, Jian; Liu, Yueping; Yuan, Zilin; Han, Chao; Chen, Jiahui; Pan, Yuxian; Chen, Li; Dan, Yunjie; Wang, Jing; Chen, Yongwen; Deng, Guohong; Zhou, Hongwei; Wu, Yuzhang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec90b0b861d31f910433d388370344024ca7c35d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleocapsid protein of SARS","nucleocapsid protein assay","Appearance of nucleocapsid protein","nucleocapsid protein positive","nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test","BACKGROUND Nucleic acid test","urine samples","nasopharyngeal swab samples","suspected SARS-CoV","early diagnosis","diagnosis of COVID","antibody assay","use of viral antigen","reference standard","infection","antibody appearance","fluorescence immunochromatographic assay","negative participants","simple method","diagnosed COVID","additional preliminary study","specific marker","invading kidney","clear need of detection","statistical evaluation","virus","cohort","findings","days of fever","earliest participant","infected population","minutes","centers","CONCLUSIONS","diagnostic value","blind","patients","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Zhiliang; Song, Ci; Xu, Chuanjun; Jin, Guangfu; Chen, Yaling; Xu, Xin; Ma, Hongxia; Chen, Wei; Lin, Yuan; Zheng, Yishan; Wang, Jianming; hu, zhibin; Yi, Yongxiang; Shen, Hongbing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a36bfdd1c9a1666401269fb0c08a3c2922bd6812.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic cases","Asymptomatic carriers","asymptomatic infections","transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID","severe COVID","typical asymptomatic transmission","close contacts of COVID","virus nucleic acid tests","continuous nucleic acid tests","nucleic acid screening","day of positive nucleic acid tests","clinical characteristics of patients","suspected patients","communicated patients","virus carriers","hospitalization","person transmission","day of continuous negative tests","obvious symptoms","chest CT scans","clinical records","days","severe illness","median communicable period","pneumonia","typical CT images of ground","importance of close contact tracing","normal CT image","laboratory assessments","glass chest","median age","Epidemiological investigations","evidence of person","surveillance","cohabiting family members","Nanjing","isolation recommendation","Jiangsu Province","Previous studies","novel coronavirus disease","years","Limited data","fatigue","interval","pharyngeal swab samples","China","fever","cough","Background","results","weeks","stripe shadowing","lungs","Methods","study","Interpretation","community","rest","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Although the risk of transmission and spread of these infections in temperate regions remains a controversial issue, vector-borne diseases have been widely reported in the media and have been the focus of preventive strategies by national and international policy-makers and public health authorities. In this context, we wanted to determine the extent of risk perception in infectious diseases (ID) physicians of the current and future risk of arboviral disease introduction, autochthonous case development and epidemic scenarios in France, Western Europe. METHODS: To this aim, we developed an original standardized questionnaire survey which was disseminated by the French Infectious Diseases Society to ID physician members. RESULTS: We found that ID physicians perceived the risk of introduction and outbreak development of DEN, CHIK and ZIKA in France to be low to medium-low. Generalized Linear Model(s) identified medical school training, the extent of professional experience, and awareness of the French national plan regarding arboviral infections as significant predictors for lower risk perception among respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that arboviral diseases are increasingly being imported into France, sometimes resulting in sporadic autochtonous transmission, French ID physicians do not perceive the risk as high. Better communication and education targeting health professionals and citizens will be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the French national plan to prepare against arboviral diseases.

These newly established cells expressing canine SLAM would help virological and serological analyses of canine distemper.","publish_time":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakano, Hitoshi; Kameo, Yuki; Andoh, Kiyohiko; Ohno, Yoshito; Mochizuki, Masami; Maeda, Ken","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ba8032f2aedc74eda0d7f73e7b4977ad78a977d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18687538/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.06.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508002484; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508002484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV","VN"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["canine SLAM","canine distemper virus","study of canine distemper","established cells","serological analyses of canine distemper","feline cells","homologous strain KDK","cSLAM","heterologous strain","genotypes Asia","virus-neutralizing","higher VN titers","Recent CDV isolates","receptors","H1","Abstract","lymphocyte activation molecule","test","vaccine Onderstepoort","sera","dogs","results","H2","distinct syncytia","CRFK"],"language":"en"},

Despite advances in prevention strategies, such as antibiotic therapies and intensive care, significant improvement in the mortality rate is still lacking. This high mortality is largely due to the limitations in current clinical practices and laboratory tests, which delay the timing of adequate antibiotic therapy. In recent years, many indicators (biomarkers) are present in scenarios where infectious pathogens invade into the body. These biomarkers, as reflected in specific biological responses to infections, have been reported to demonstrate the ability to facilitate the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of pneumonia. This review provides a schematic overview of these new potential biomarkers based on the categories of (1) microorganisms and their derivatives, (2) inflammation mediators, (3) inflammation response proteins, and (4) stress-sensing proteins. In addition, approaches to identifying new biomarkers are also briefly introduced. Although no current biomarker can solely achieve a definitive diagnosis, many of them can be complemented, rather than replaced outright, in routine clinical practices to improve decision-making processes regarding pneumonia.","publish_time":"2013-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Chao-Wen; Chien, Ming-Hsien; Su, Shih-Chi; Yang, Shun-Fa","journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d079fb08fd02dcf59cbbe49d3cdc260087ade8a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094281.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2013.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23384502/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898113000338; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898113000338","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new biomarkers","new potential biomarkers","current clinical practices","management of pneumonia","Abstract Pneumonia","routine clinical practices","inflammation response proteins","antibiotic therapies","infectious diseases","infectious pathogens","inflammation mediators","current biomarker","mortality rate","definitive diagnosis","high mortality","common causes of death","common fatal infection","stress-sensing proteins","timing of adequate antibiotic therapy","significant improvement","intensive care","laboratory tests","schematic overview","decision-making processes","limitations","risk stratification","prevention strategies","indicators","categories","scenarios","specific biological responses","infections","derivatives","hospitals","recent years","microorganisms","advances","review","body","ability","addition"],"language":"en"},

(2012) Comparing the use of, and considering the need for, lumbar puncture in children with influenza or other respiratory virus infections. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses DOI:10.1111/irv.12039. Background The clinical presentation of influenza in infancy may be similar to serious bacterial infection and be investigated with invasive procedures like lumbar puncture (LP), despite very limited evidence that influenza occurs concomitantly with bacterial meningitis, perhaps because the diagnosis of influenza is very often not established when the decision to perform LP is being considered. Methods A retrospective medical record review was undertaken in all children presenting to the Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia, in one winter season with laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza or other respiratory virus infections (ORVIs) but excluding respiratory syncytial virus, to compare the use of, and reflect on the need for, the performance of invasive diagnostic procedures, principally LP, but also blood culture, in influenza and non\u2010influenza cases. We also determined the rate of concomitant bacterial meningitis or bacteraemia. Findings Of 294 children, 51% had laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza and 49% had ORVIs such as parainfluenza viruses (34%) and adenoviruses (15%). Of those with influenza, 18% had a LP and 71% had a blood culture performed compared with 6\u00B73% and 55\u00B75% in the ORVI group (for both P \u003C 0\u00B701). In multivariate analysis, diagnosis of influenza was a strong independent predictor of both LP (P = 0\u00B702) and blood culture (P = 0\u00B705) being performed, and, in comparison with ORVIs, influenza cases were almost three times more likely to have a LP performed on presentation to hospital. One child with influenza (0\u00B79%) had bacteraemia and none had meningitis. Interpretation Children with influenza were more likely to undergo LP on presentation to hospital compared with those presenting with ORVIs. If influenza is confirmed on admission by near\u2010patient testing, clinicians may be reassured and less inclined to perform LP, although if meningitis is clinically suspected, the clinician should act accordingly. We found that the risk of bacterial meningitis and bacteraemia was very low in hospitalised children with influenza and ORVIs. A systematic review should be performed to investigate this across a large number of settings.","publish_time":"2012-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khandaker, Gulam; Heron, Leon; Rashid, Harunor; Li\u2010Kim\u2010Moy, Jean; Lester\u2010Smith, David; Kesson, Alison; McCaskill, Mary; Jones, Cheryl; Zurynski, Yvonne; Elliott, Elizabeth J.; Dwyer, Dominic E.; Booy, Robert","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e00be029fff23d2dd375aa4f86cef9d79b1ac7c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23122417/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORVI"],"locations":["LP","Australia"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of influenza","LP","clinical presentation of influenza","non\u2010influenza cases","ORVIs","risk of bacterial meningitis","hospitalised children","respiratory virus infections","bacteraemia","Interpretation Children","blood culture","rate of concomitant bacterial meningitis","respiratory syncytial virus","Respiratory Viruses DOI","invasive procedures","serious bacterial infection","lumbar puncture","Children\u2019s Hospital","need","laboratory","performance of invasive diagnostic procedures","parainfluenza viruses","systematic review","retrospective medical record review","infancy","strong independent predictor","Sydney","Australia","winter season","Methods","Westmead","times","limited evidence","clinicians","patient testing","irv","admission","multivariate analysis","comparison","large number of settings","ORVI group","paper","Khandaker","adenoviruses","Findings","decision"],"language":"en"},

Comparative sequence analysis of Ark DPI with other IBV strains shows striking similarity to the Conn, Gray, JMK, and Ark 99, which were circulating during that time period. Furthermore, comparison of the Ark genome with other coronaviruses demonstrates a close relationship to turkey coronavirus. Among non-structural genes, the 5\u0027untranslated region (UTR), 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)) and the polymerase (RdRp) sequences are 100% identical to the Gray strain. Among structural genes, S1 has 97% identity with Ark 99; S2 has 100% identity with JMK and 96% to Conn; 3b 99%, and 3C to N is 100% identical to Conn strain. Possible recombination sites were found at the intergenic region of spike gene, 3\u0027end of S1 and 3a gene. Independent recombination events may have occurred in the entire genome of Ark DPI, involving four different IBV strains, suggesting that genomic RNA recombination may occur in any part of the genome at number of sites.

In humans, prolonged exposure to manganese causes neurotoxicity characterized by Parkinson-like symptoms. Mn(2\u002B) has been shown to mediate DNA damage possibly through the generation of reactive oxygen species. In a recent publication, we showed that Mn induced oxidative DNA damage and caused lesions in thymines. This study further investigates the mechanisms by which cells process Mn(2\u002B)-mediated DNA damage using the yeast S. cerevisiae. The strains most sensitive to Mn(2\u002B) were those defective in base excision repair, glutathione synthesis, and superoxide dismutase mutants. Mn(2\u002B) caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of mutations using the CAN1 and lys2-10A mutator assays. The spectrum of CAN1 mutants indicates that exposure to Mn results in accumulation of base substitutions and frameshift mutations. The sensitivity of cells to Mn(2\u002B) as well as its mutagenic effect was reduced by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, and Mg(2\u002B). These data suggest that Mn(2\u002B) causes oxidative DNA damage that requires base excision repair for processing and that Mn interferes with polymerase fidelity. The status of base excision repair may provide a biomarker for the sensitivity of individuals to manganese.","publish_time":"2013-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stephenson, Adrienne P.; Mazu, Tryphon K.; Miles, Jana S.; Freeman, Miles D.; Reams, R.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers\u0027 destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers\u0027 end destination data for the period of 1\u201331 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers\u0027 end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4(th) quantile being the highest risk and 1(st) quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4(th) quantile of the risk index, two in the 3(rd) quantile, one in the 2(nd) quantile and none in the 1(st) quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to na\u00EFve countries.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haider, Najmul; Yavlinsky, Alexei; Simons, David; Osman, Abdinasir Yusuf; Ntoumi, Francine; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kock, Richard","journal":"Epidemiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cac0c21efacbaeb24987e6cf2da64874455ec3cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7058650.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820000424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32100667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","UK"],"locations":["Beijing","China","Shanghai","Guangzhou","Thailand","Cambodia","Malaysia","Germany","Africa","South America","Ethiopia","South Africa","Mauritius","Brazil","Europe","France","Russia","Oceania","Australia","North America","Canada"],"keyphrases":["risk index","high risk","higher risk","highest risk","lowest risk","similar risk of transmission","passengers\u0027 destination countries","na\u00EFve countries","nCoV transmission","risk score classification","neighbouring Asian countries","Canada","USA","isolation of identified case","early case recognition","North America","South America","number of confirmed cases","public health response","Germany","France","Russia","UK","Oceania","weekly simulated passengers\u0027 end destination data","Wuhan city","South Africa","Australia","World Health Organization","high correlation","period","territories","major cities of China","vigilance of health workers","public awareness","human passenger air flight","direct flight","departed city","number of travellers","pan-Europe","Novel Coronavirus","Coronavirus-infected pneumonia","online air travel dataset","targeted airport screening","contract tracing","Mauritius","Brazil","Italy","Guangzhou","information","Egypt","Beijing","Shanghai","Ethiopia","force","Malaysia","Thailand","Cambodia","FLIRT","airlines","COVID","quantiles","spread","airports","SARS-COV","study","country","objective","humans","rd"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. RESULTS: : Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. CONCLUSIONS: : Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lima, N\u00E1dia Nara Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo In\u00E1cio; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","journal":"Psychiatry Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/182967084f4171a989ff21225dad50f94e4e1cdc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151321.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120306491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302813/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120306491?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health conditions","mental health disorders","mental health impacts","Homeless people","health care providers","affordable health care","diminished health condition","mental illness","local health departments","mental medical conditions","lack of access","streets","risk factors","homelessness","lack of reliable","environmental factors","greater risk","coronavirus infection","threat of infection","prevalence of underlying physical","higher rates of chronic illnesses","inadequate lighting","stress","green spaces","noise","anxiety","addiction","depression","slums","large-sized newspapers","serious manifestation","Insufficient housing quality","international circulation","violence","pollution","immune systems","lower life expectancy","death","recognizing","difficulty","forms of social dysfunction","studies","BACKGROUND","Crowding","coordination","suffering","urgent solution","unmet needs","diagnostic testing","competing","RESULTS","Experts","limbo","shelters","METHOD","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, clinical studies proved an association between harmless upper respiratory tract infections and more severe diseases e.g. sinusitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both the medicinal and socio\u2010economic impact of HRV infections and the lack of antiviral drugs substantiate the need for intensive antiviral research. A common structural feature of the approximately 100 HRV serotypes is the icosahedrally shaped capsid formed by 60 identical copies of viral capsid proteins VP1\u20104. The capsid protects the single\u2010stranded, positive sense RNA genome of about 7,400 bases in length. Both structural as well as nonstructural proteins produced during the viral life cycle have been identified as potential targets for blocking viral replication at the step of attachment, entry, uncoating, RNA and protein synthesis by synthetic or natural compounds. Moreover, interferon and phytoceuticals were shown to protect host cells. Most of the known inhibitors of HRV replication were discovered as a result of empirical or semi\u2010empirical screening in cell culture. Structure\u2013activity relationship studies are used for hit optimization and lead structure discovery. The increasing structural insight and molecular understanding of viral proteins on the one hand and the advent of innovative computer\u2010assisted technologies on the other hand have facilitated a rationalized access for the discovery of small chemical entities with antirhinoviral (anti\u2010HRV) activity. This review will (i) summarize existing structural knowledge about HRV, (ii) focus on mechanisms of anti\u2010HRV agents from synthetic and natural origin, and (iii) demonstrate strategies for efficient lead structure discovery. \u00A9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of coronaviruses is required for proteolytic processing of polyproteins and viral replication, and is a promising target for the development of drugs against coronaviral infection. We designed and synthesized four nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors with different N-terminal protective groups and different peptide length, and examined their inhibitory effect on the in-vitro enzymatic activity of 3CLpro of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus. The IC50 values of the inhibitors were in the range of 4.6\u201349 \u03BCM, demonstrating that the nitrile warhead can effectively inactivate the 3CLpro autocleavage process. The best inhibitor, Cbz-AVLQ-CN with an N-terminal carbobenzyloxy group, was \u223C10x more potent than the other inhibitors tested. Crystal structures of the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complexes showed that the nitrile warhead inhibits 3CLpro by forming a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145 residue, while the AVLQ peptide forms a number of favourable interactions with the S1\u2013S4 substrate-binding pockets. We have further showed that the peptidomimetic inhibitor, Cbz-AVLQ-CN, has broad-spectrum inhibition against 3CLpro from human coronavirus strains 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, and infectious bronchitis virus, with IC50 values ranging from 1.3 to 3.7 \u03BCM, but no detectable inhibition against caspase-3. In summary, we have shown that the nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors are effective against 3CLpro, and they inhibit 3CLpro from a broad range of coronaviruses. Our results provide further insights into the future design of drugs that could serve as a first line defence against coronaviral infection.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuck, Chi-Pang; Chen, Chao; Ke, Zhihai; Chi-Cheong Wan, David; Chow, Hak-Fun; Wong, Kam-Bo","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eede0f9596687fae94c0d3481a43ea34f38a09b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115530.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523412006575; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523412006575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2012.10.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202846/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLpro of severe","nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors","CLpro autocleavage process","nitrile warhead","AVLQ peptide","Cbz-AVLQ","Abstract Coronaviral infection","CN","inhibitor complexes","best inhibitor","IC50 values","\u03BCM","different peptide length","broad range of coronaviruses","different N-terminal protective groups","N-terminal carbobenzyloxy group","broad-spectrum inhibition","syndrome-coronavirus","development of drugs","acute-respiratory","detectable inhibition","human coronavirus strains","future design of drugs","respiratory tract diseases","HKU1","OC43","NL63","infectious bronchitis virus","number of favourable interactions","catalytic Cys145 residue","viral replication","covalent bond","S4 substrate-binding pockets","proteolytic processing of polyproteins","vitro enzymatic activity","promising target","inhibitory effect","insights","enzyme","Crystal structures","line defence","protease","results","caspase","summary"],"language":"en"},

In these low-income countries, most patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), whether it is mild or severe, are still treated empirically. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a paediatric ward in Antananarivo from November 2010 to July 2012 including patients under 5 years old suffering from respiratory infections. We collected demographic, socio-economic, clinical and epidemiological data, and samples for laboratory analysis. Deaths, rapid progression to respiratory distress during hospitalisation, and hospitalisation for more than 10 days were considered as severe outcomes. We used multivariate analysis to study the effects of co-infections. RESULTS: From November 2010 to July 2012, a total of 290 patients were enrolled. Co-infection was found in 192 patients (70%). Co-infections were more frequent in children under 36 months, with a significant difference for the 19\u201324 month-old group (OR: 8.0). Sixty-nine percent (230/290) of the patients recovered fully and without any severe outcome during hospitalisation; the outcome was scored as severe for 60 children and nine patients (3%) died. Risk factors significantly associated with worsening evolution during hospitalisation (severe outcome) were admission at age under 6 months (OR = 5.3), comorbidity (OR = 4.6) and low household income (OR = 4.1). CONCLUSION: Co-mordidity, low-income and age under 6 months increase the risk of severe outcome for children infected by numerous respiratory pathogens. These results highlight the need for implementation of targeted public health policy to reduce the contribution of respiratory diseases to childhood morbidity and mortality in low income countries.","publish_time":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajatonirina, Soatiana; Razanajatovo, Norosoa Harline; Ratsima, Elisoa Hariniana; Orelle, Arnaud; Ratovoson, Rila; Andrianirina, Zo Zafitsara; Andriatahina, Todisoa; Ramparany, Lovasoa; Herindrainy, Perlinot; Randrianirina, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Richard, Vincent","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39d94b291715335c79664305706e67a752304121.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3771918.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24069161/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072839","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Antananarivo"],"keyphrases":["patients","hospitalisation","risk of severe outcome","outcome of respiratory illnesses","Acute respiratory infections","respiratory distress","children","severe outcomes","contribution of respiratory diseases","numerous respiratory pathogens","months","effects of co-infections","risk factors","low-income countries","Co-mordidity","low income countries","mortality","age","prospective study","developing countries","RESULTS","years old suffering","low household income","childhood morbidity","worsening evolution","laboratory analysis","multivariate analysis","leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity","epidemiological data","implementation of targeted public health policy","need","samples","rapid progression","admission","paediatric ward","Deaths","demographic","METHODS","Antananarivo","CONCLUSION","days","BACKGROUND","significant difference","total","month-old group","MATERIALS","aim","percent","comorbidity"],"language":"en"},

Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies. The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified. MAIN BODY: Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75\u20137.54). No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures. Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles. The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material. Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures. A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection. Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission. CONCLUSION: Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating. Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus. Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence. Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mick, Paul; Murphy, Russell","journal":"J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9fd7732ffddfec3f71d98e6035b4d2b22275c8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212733.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00424-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["otolaryngology procedures","various procedures","risk of transmission","outpatient procedures","various personal protective equipment","indirect evidence","Experimental evidence","likelihood of transmission","Otolaryngology groups","high risk of contracting COVID","higher level of personal protective equipment","neck surgery procedures","Adequate personal protective equipment","viral load of COVID","rate of transmission","enhanced personal protective equipment protocols","protected health care workers","direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses","upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients","large number of otolaryngology","higher level of PPE","greater level of filtration","public health agencies","aerosols","tracheotomy","high viral loads","viral material","times greater odds","aerosolized biological particles","head","open suctioning","drilling","electrocautery","China","advanced energy devices","disease","epidemic","degree","N95 masks","MAIN BODY","SARS-CoV","studies","BACKGROUND","Powered air purifying respirators","Cough","normal breathing","probable","controls","significant proportion of individuals","CONCLUSION","Otolaryngologists","pandemic","symptoms","confirmed infection","review","precautionary principle","objective","research"],"language":"en"},

Infection with neurotropic strains JHM and A59 causes acute encephalitis, and in survivors, chronic demyelination, the latter of which serves as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. The MHV receptor is a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule, CEACAM1a; paradoxically, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to speculation of an additional receptor. Comparison of highly neurovirulent JHM isolates with less virulent variants and the weakly neurovirulent A59 strain, combined with the use of reverse genetics, has allowed mapping of pathogenic properties to individual viral genes. The spike protein, responsible for viral entry, is a major determinant of tropism and virulence. Other viral proteins, both structural and nonstructural, also contribute to pathogenesis in the CNS. Studies of host responses to MHV indicate that both innate and adaptive responses are crucial to antiviral defense. Type I interferon is essential to prevent very early mortality after infection. CD8 T cells, with the help of CD4 T cells, are crucial for viral clearance during acute disease and persist in the CNS during chronic disease. B cells are necessary to prevent reactivation of virus in the CNS following clearance of acute infection. Despite advances in understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis, questions remain regarding the mechanisms of viral entry and spread in cell types expressing low levels of receptor, as well as the unique interplay between virus and the host immune system during acute and chronic disease.","publish_time":"2010-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bender, Susan J.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"J Neuroimmune Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d97d18fc999823cf462f2a10a9ec1b3ab7545ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2914825.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20369302/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-010-9202-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHM","MHV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute disease","CNS","viral clearance","chronic disease","viral proteins","MHV receptor","clearance of acute infection","mechanisms of viral entry","acute encephalitis","individual viral genes","reactivation of virus","CEACAM1a","B cells","CD8 T cells","additional receptor","chronic demyelination","help of CD4 T cells","neurovirulent JHM isolates","neurotropic strains JHM","host immune system","mouse hepatitis virus","Studies of host responses","understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis","low levels of receptor","cell types","weakly neurovirulent A59 strain","adaptive responses","collection of strains","Murine coronavirus","central nervous system","carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule","virulent variants","mapping of pathogenic properties","questions","major determinant of tropism","antiviral defense","spike protein","unique interplay","survivors","use of reverse genetics","early mortality","organ systems of mice","animal model","multiple sclerosis","virulence","advances","Comparison","speculation","interferon"],"language":"en"},

Recent IBV infections in Sweden have been associated with poor growth in broilers, drop in egg production and thin egg shells in layers. The complete spike gene of selected isolates from IBV cases was amplified and sequenced using conventional RT-PCR. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons have shown that the recent isolates bear 98.97% genetic similarity with strains of the QX-like genotype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that strains predominant in the nineties, which were of the Massachusetts type, have been replaced by D388/QX-like strains, however the evolutionary link could not be established. The homology between the two genotypes was 79 and 81%. Remarkably, a strong positive selection pressure was determined, mostly involving the S1 subunit of the S gene. This strong selective pressure resulted in recombination events, insertions and deletions in the S gene. Two new isolates generated from recombination were found with nucleotide sequence diverging 1.7\u20132.4% from the D388/QX-like branch, indicating the emergence of a new lineage. The study demonstrates a constant evolution of IBV that might be in relation to increased poultry farming, trade and vaccine pressure. The findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring to control spread of infections, as well as to timely adjust diagnostic methods, molecular epidemiological studies, development and use of vaccines that are adapted to the changing disease scenario.","publish_time":"2012-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abro, Shahid Hussain; Renstr\u00F6m, Lena H.M.; Ullman, Karin; Isaksson, Mats; Zohari, Siamak; Jansson, D\u00E9sir\u00E9e S.; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Baule, Claudia","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10ae61e1f568cda9733a3be6166eaec8d800dda0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117472.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511005323; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511005323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005179/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.09.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["QX","Recent IBV infections","IBV cases","recent isolates","S gene","new isolates","constant evolution of IBV","strains predominant","vaccine pressure","strong selective pressure","nucleotide sequence","D388","complete spike gene of selected isolates","strong positive selection pressure","avian infectious bronchitis","important disease","recombination events","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","egg production","poultry farming","poultry industry","egg shells","spread of infections","new lineage","changing disease scenario","amino acid sequence comparisons","molecular epidemiological studies","severe economic losses","insertions","diagnostic methods","development","trade","deletions","Sweden","genetic similarity","importance of continuous monitoring","broilers","relation","poor growth","vaccines","findings","emergence","layers","nineties","phylogenetic analysis","study","branch","S1 subunit","conventional RT-PCR","Massachusetts type","evolutionary link","homology","genotypes"],"language":"en"},

Progress in antiviral therapy is particularly hindered by appearance of mutants capable of overcoming the effects of drugs targeting viral components. Alternatively, development of drugs targeting host proteins essential for completion of viral lifecycle holds potential as a viable strategy for antiviral therapy. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways in particular are involved in several pathological conditions including cancer and viral infections, where hijacking or alteration of function of key transporter proteins, such as Chromosome Region Maintenance1 (CRM1) is observed. Overexpression of CRM1-mediated nuclear export is evident in several solid and hematological malignancies. Interestingly, CRM1-mediated nuclear export of viral components is crucial in various stages of the viral lifecycle and assembly. This review summarizes the role of CRM1 in cancer and selected viruses. Leptomycin B (LMB) is the prototypical inhibitor of CRM1 potent against various cancer cell lines overexpressing CRM1 and in limiting viral infections at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. However, the irreversible shutdown of nuclear export results in high cytotoxicity and limited efficacy in vivo. This has prompted search for synthetic and natural CRM1 inhibitors that can potentially be developed as broadly active antivirals, some of which are summarized in this review.","publish_time":"2017-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathew, Cynthia; Ghildyal, Reena","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f45e2e283d5ed3b5a842d67bac964bf8a62d851.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5487384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28702009/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chromosome Region"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","role of CRM1","Overexpression of CRM1","nuclear export of viral components","completion of viral lifecycle","natural CRM1 inhibitors","prototypical inhibitor of CRM1 potent","antiviral therapy","review","irreversible shutdown of nuclear export results","various cancer cell lines","various stages","major advancements","effects of drugs","development of drugs","host proteins essential","key transporter proteins","major global concern","high cytotoxicity","alteration of function","potential","hijacking","medical research","viable strategy","Chromosome Region Maintenance1","pathological conditions","limited efficacy","significant morbidity","LMB","Infectious diseases","appearance of mutants capable","selected viruses","Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways","hematological malignancies","nanomolar concentrations","assembly","Leptomycin B","mortality","Progress","active antivirals"],"language":"en"},

The 2011 Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force recommended that expected duration of critical care be incorporated into resource allocation algorithms. We aimed to determine whether currently available pediatric illness severity scores can predict duration of critical care resource use. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. PATIENTS: PICU patients admitted 2016\u20132018 for greater than or equal to 12 hours (n = 3,206). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed logistic and linear regression models in two-thirds of the cohort to predict need for and duration of PICU resources based on Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and serial Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 scores. We tested the predictive accuracy of the models with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (need for each resource) and R(2) (duration of use) in a validation cohort of the remaining one of three of the sample and among patients admitted during one-third of the sample and among patients admitted during surges of respiratory illness. Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score calculated 12 hours postadmission had higher predictive accuracy than either Pediatric Risk of Mortality or Pediatric Index of Mortality scores. Models incorporating 12-hour Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, age, Pediatric Overall Performance Category, Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category, chronic mechanical ventilation, and postoperative status had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.8831 for need for any PICU resource (positive predictive value 80.2%, negative predictive value 85.9%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.9157 for mechanical ventilation (positive predictive value 85.7%, negative predictive value 89.2%) within 7 days of admission. Models accurately predicted greater than or equal to 24 hours of any resource use for 78.9% of patients and greater than or equal to 24 hours of ventilation for 83.1%. Model fit and accuracy improved for prediction of resource use within 3 days of admission, and was lower for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, vasoactive infusions, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: A model incorporating 12-hour Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score performed well in estimating how long patients may require PICU resources, especially mechanical ventilation. A pediatric disaster triage algorithm that includes both likelihood for survival and for requiring critical care resources could minimize subjectivity in resource allocation decision-making.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Killien, Elizabeth Y.; Mills, Brianna; Errett, Nicole A.; Sakata, Vicki; Vavilala, Monica S.; Rivara, Frederick P.; Kissoon, Niranjan; King, Mary A.","journal":"Pediatr Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d21fa928caf0a005ec786eee0dfce0a8e81dc608.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345932/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric disaster","Pediatric protocols","Pediatric Risk of Mortality","Pediatric Index of Mortality scores","serial Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction","hour Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score","PICU patients","Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category","Pediatric Overall Performance Category","duration of critical care resource use","hours of ventilation","duration of use","positive predictive value","prediction of resource use","available pediatric illness severity scores","critical care resources","duration of PICU resources","negative predictive value","Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force","resource allocation decision-making","resource allocation algorithms","long patients","higher predictive accuracy","expected duration of critical care","chronic mechanical ventilation","characteristic curve","receiver","need","allocation of limited resources","noninvasive positive pressure ventilation","hours postadmission","highest area","linear regression models","validation cohort","days of admission","sample","Retrospective cohort study","Model fit","disaster lack data","surges of respiratory illness","vasoactive infusions","continuous renal replacement therapy","age","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","subjectivity","postoperative status","thirds","survival","likelihood","length of stay","MAIN RESULTS","SETTING","Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital","DESIGN","MEASUREMENTS","CONCLUSIONS","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201C alert signals \u201C identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularly be adapted to the latest epidemiological, clinical and biological findings, taking interactions between the pathogen, host, and environment into consideration. The need to improve reaction times and risk assessment is also discussed.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bitar, Dounia; Tarantola, Arnaud; Capek, Isabelle; Barboza, Philippe; Che, Didier","journal":"Bulletin de l\u0027Acad\u00E9mie Nationale de M\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/774a2580d089d4ae3bdfa95554cf9c9592447003.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919324185; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919324185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["process of detection","risk assessment","risk analysis","Early detection of potential infectious threats","animal health","assessment of health risks","risk of introduction","response process","routine surveillance networks","focus of surveillance networks","French public health institute","exotic diseases","Transmissible diseases","alert signals","metropolitan France","respect","biological findings","interactions","tropical regions","host","SUMMARY","reaction times","specific cases","screening","environment","novel pathogens","article","multidisciplinary approach","need","systems","possible responses","consideration","quality","accuracy","dissemination"],"language":"en"},

The objectives were to determine if DNA editing resulted in a delay in development to the blastocyst stage or in a skewing of the sex ratio. Six DNA templates (gBlocks) that were designed to express guide RNAs that target the transmembrane protease, serine S1, member 2 (TMPRSS2) gene were in vitro transcribed. Pairs of CRISPR guide RNAs that flanked the start codon and polyadenylated Cas9 were co-injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes and cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were collected as they formed on days 5, 6 or 7. PCR was performed to determine genotype and sex of each embryo. Separately, embryos were surgically transferred into recipient gilts on day 4 of estrus. The rate of blastocyst development was not significantly different between CRISPR injection embryos or the non-injected controls at day 5, 6 or 7 (p = 0.36, 0.09, 0.63, respectively). Injection of three CRISPR sets of guides resulted in a detectable INDEL in 92\u2013100 % of the embryos analyzed. There was not a difference in the number of edits or sex ratio of male to female embryos when compared between days 5, 6 and 7 to the controls (p \u003E 0.22, \u003E0.85). There were 12 resulting piglets and all 12 had biallelic edits of TMRPSS2. Zygote injection with CRISPR/Cas9 continues to be a highly efficient tool to genetically modify pig embryos.

It has been reported that after natural infection in humans and immunization in animals with SARS-CoV vaccine, antibody is produced and persistent for a long period of time. In the present study, mice were immunized i.m. with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, and three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses when the cells were stimulated in vitro with a pool of peptides overlapping entire SARS spike protein. The results show that prime-immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can induce both CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell responses. Boosting with the same vaccine enhances CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs and were persistent over two months. The SARS-CoV S-specific CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells were CD62L\u2212, a marker for memory cells, and \u221230 to 50% of the cells expressed IL-7R\u03B1 (CD127), a marker for the capacity of effector cells to develop into memory cells. In addition, immunization with the DNA vaccine elicited high levels of antibody production. Taken together, these data demonstrate that immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can generate antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses that may contribute to long-term protection.","publish_time":"2006-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jun; Ma, Rui; Wu, Chang-you","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45dd2260efb45c535375c93e97d80e9144b7ad15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115633.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06003847; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06003847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FACS","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV vaccine","SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine","T cells","SARS-CoV S-specific CD4","effective vaccine","memory cells","T cell responses","cellular immune responses","CD8","capacity of effector cells","entire SARS spike protein","prime-immunization","marker","antigen-specific humoral","high levels of antibody production","severe acute respiratory syndrome","different methods","animals","nonlymphoid organs","pool of peptides","humans","CD62L","ELISA","ELISPOT","mice","R\u03B1","maintenance","natural infection","FACS","present study","long period of time","CD127","IL","generation","addition","long-term protection","months","results","data"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here, we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.","publish_time":"2018-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dudas, Gytis; Carvalho, Luiz Max; Rambaut, Andrew; Bedford, Trevor","journal":"eLife","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e8f07d17aaa0e83209868716d79a4527952c0ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5777824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29336306/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.31257","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["camels","long-term MERS-CoV evolution","existing MERS-CoV sequence data","zoonotic virus","humans act","Arabian Peninsula","zoonotic introduction times","viral sequence data","varying zoonotic transfer of viruses","human outbreaks","unseen evolution of host tropism","terminal host","distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes","morbidity","significant mortality","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","phylodynamics","known major hosts","structured coalescent models","epidemic","case","seroepidemiological studies","epidemiology","potential"],"language":"en"},

HVAC \u0026 R Research 2005; 11: 563\u201385], who studied how ventilation conditions impact dispersion of pathogenic nuclei in an AIIR by investigating the airflow conditions impacting dispersion of infectious agents in the AIIR. The work included a careful quality assurance study of the computed airflow, and final simulations were performed on a fine tetrahedral mesh with approximately 1.3\u00D7106 cells. The 1\u03BCm diameter particles were released from a 0.001225m2 area representing the nose and mouth. Two cases were investigated during the current study: continuous exhalation of pathogen-laden air from the patient and expulsion of pathogenic particles by a single cough or sneeze. Slow decay of particle concentration in the AIIR during the single cough/sneeze simulation and tendency for particle accumulation near the AIIR walls observed in the continuous breathing simulation suggest that unintended exposures are possible despite the ventilation system. Based on these findings, it is recommended that extra care be taken to assure proper functionality of personal protective equipment used in an AIIR.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richmond-Bryant, Jennifer","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/641ddae8963ac3177731bd9e2095837f2ace30dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127665.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132308000127; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2008.01.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288002/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132308000127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Huang","Tsao"],"organizations":["HVAC \u0026 R Research","AIIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AIIR walls","pathogenic agent","expulsion of pathogenic particles","sneeze simulation","airflow conditions","single cough","ventilation conditions impact dispersion of pathogenic nuclei","continuous breathing simulation","laden air","computed airflow","current study","particle accumulation","concentration profiles","Slow decay of particle concentration","final simulations","extra care","ventilation system","work of Huang","R Research","influence of air motion","continuous exhalation of pathogen","dispersion of infectious agents","\u03BCm diameter particles","negative pressure isolation rooms","careful quality assurance study","airborne infection isolation room","health care workers\u2019 exposure","Computational fluid dynamics simulations","bacteria removal","tendency","unintended exposures","patient","proper functionality of personal protective equipment","Tsao","spatial velocity","characteristics","fine tetrahedral mesh","001225m2 area","nose","mouth","HVAC","investigation","purpose","cases","cells","findings","goal"],"language":"en"},

We have used NGS to identify RNA viruses in the blood of 195 patients with UAFI and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy (i.e., no overt signs of illness) control individuals, all from communities in southeastern Nigeria. Among UAFI patients, we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as HIV-1, hepatitis, and Lassa virus. In our cohort of healthy individuals, however, we detected the nucleic acids of two novel rhabdoviruses. These viruses, which we call Ekpoma virus-1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus-2 (EKV-2), are highly divergent, with little identity to each other or other known viruses. The most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus Tibrovirus and Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever. Furthermore, by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort, we find evidence for remarkably high exposure rates to the identified rhabdoviruses. The recent discoveries of novel rhabdoviruses by multiple research groups suggest that human infection with rhabdoviruses might be common. While the prevalence and clinical significance of these viruses are currently unknown, these viruses could have previously unrecognized impacts on human health; further research to understand the immunological and developmental impact of these viruses should be explored. More generally, the identification of similar novel viruses in individuals with and without overt symptoms of disease highlights the need for a broader understanding of the human virome as efforts for viral detection and discovery advance.","publish_time":"2015-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stremlau, Matthew H.; Andersen, Kristian G.; Folarin, Onikepe A.; Grove, Jessica N.; Odia, Ikponmwonsa; Ehiane, Philomena E.; Omoniwa, Omowunmi; Omoregie, Omigie; Jiang, Pan-Pan; Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Matranga, Christian B.; Yang, Xiao; Gire, Stephen K.; Winnicki, Sarah; Tariyal, Ridhi; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Okokhere, Peter O.; Okogbenin, Sylvanus; Akpede, George O.; Asogun, Danny A.; Agbonlahor, Dennis E.; Walker, Peter J.; Tesh, Robert B.; Levin, Joshua Z.; Garry, Robert F.; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Happi, Christian T.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/824c9c7d7d8c1ec672e85def94cee3bb471cb5a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4363514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25781465/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003631","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","UAFI"],"locations":["Nigeria","Ekpoma"],"keyphrases":["discovery of viruses","known viruses","RNA viruses","identified rhabdoviruses","identification of similar novel viruses","well-characterized pathogenic viruses","related rhabdoviruses","Ekpoma virus","overt symptoms of disease","human infection","human health","recent discoveries of novel rhabdoviruses","Lassa virus","UAFI patients","complete human virome","cohort of healthy individuals","control individuals","overt signs of illness","presence of nucleic acids","Bas-Congo virus","potential","EKV","NGS","discovery advance","unrecognized impacts","pathogen\u2019s nucleic acid sequence","developmental consequences","developmental impact","study cohort","multiple research groups","unexplained acute febrile illness","efforts","genus Tibrovirus","viral detection","evidence","knowledge","members","broader understanding","high exposure rates","need","communities","HIV","blood","little identity","clinical significance","hemorrhagic fever","hepatitis","BASV","prevalence","southeastern Nigeria","generation sequencing","serosurvey"],"language":"en"},

Expanding research on the human microbiome now allows ME/CFS-associated pathogens to be studied as interacting members of human microbiome communities. Humans harbor these vast ecosystems of bacteria, viruses and fungi in nearly all tissue and blood. Most well-studied inflammatory conditions are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of the human microbiome. While gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS, microbes and viruses outside the gut can also contribute to the illness. Pathobionts, and their associated proteins/metabolites, often control human metabolism and gene expression in a manner that pushes the body toward a state of illness. Intracellular pathogens, including many associated with ME/CFS, drive microbiome dysbiosis by directly interfering with human transcription, translation, and DNA repair processes. Molecular mimicry between host and pathogen proteins/metabolites further complicates this interference. Other human pathogens disable mitochondria or dysregulate host nervous system signaling. Antibodies and/or clonal T cells identified in patients with ME/CFS are likely activated in response to these persistent microbiome pathogens. Different human pathogens have evolved similar survival mechanisms to disable the host immune response and host metabolic pathways. The metabolic dysfunction driven by these organisms can result in similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms. ME/CFS may be driven by this pathogen-induced dysfunction, with the nature of dysbiosis and symptom presentation varying based on a patient\u0027s unique infectious and environmental history. Under such conditions, patients would benefit from treatments that support the human immune system in an effort to reverse the infectious disease process.","publish_time":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proal, Amy; Marshall, Trevor","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/742745c77662d0b7923d6874c324e23f1edca6c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6288442.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2018.00373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Different human pathogens","CFS-associated pathogens","human metabolism","human transcription","human immune system","gut microbiome dysbiosis","persistent microbiome pathogens","drive microbiome dysbiosis","interacting members of human microbiome communities","Intracellular pathogens","host immune response","nature of dysbiosis","associated proteins","host metabolic pathways","host nervous system","pathogen proteins","infectious agents","viruses","metabolites","metabolic dysfunction","patients","state of illness","well-studied inflammatory conditions","patient\u0027s unique infectious","infectious disease process","pathogen-induced dysfunction","similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms","similar survival mechanisms","effort","fungi","translation","treatments","mitochondria","vast ecosystems of bacteria","symptom presentation","manner","DNA repair processes","clonal T cells","Epstein Barr Virus","environmental history","gene expression","organisms","Molecular mimicry","imbalance","Antibodies","Humans","tissue","body","microbes","blood","interference","Pathobionts","research"],"language":"en"},

The virus replication involves three broad essential stages carried out by all types of viruses: the initiation of infection, replication and expression of the genome, and the release of mature virions from the infected cell. At a detailed level, there are many differences in the replication processes of different viruses that are imposed by the biology of the host cell and the nature of the virus genome. The other stages that have been discussed are: attachment, penetration, uncoating, genome replication, gene expression, assembly, maturation, and release. The chapter illustrates similarities in the pattern of replication of different viruses. Regardless of their hosts, all viruses must undergo each of these stages in some form to successfully complete their replication cycles.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cann, Alan J.","journal":"Principles of Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b818cf3a99c935d901c93510417905c1fd00b05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149686.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123849397100043; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123849397100043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome replication","virus replication step","pattern of replication","replication cycles","overview of virus replication","replication processes of different viruses","virus genome","complex viruses","types of viruses","chapter","broad essential stages","gene expression","infected cell","host cell","release of mature virions","uncoating","assembly","differences","initiation of infection","maturation","penetration","nature","studying bacteriophages","attachment","biology","similarities","form","Publisher Summary","detailed level","hosts"],"language":"en"},

Cathepsins are divided into three groups, i.e., cysteine protease, serine protease, and aspartic protease. Cathepsin D and cathepsin L, which are aspartic protease and cysteine protease respectively, have been identified in a number of teleosts; however, the immunological relevance of fish cathepsins is largely unknown. In this study, we cloned and analyzed the expression profiles of a cathepsin D (CsCatD) and a cathepsin L (CsCatL) homologs from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). CsCatD is composed of 396 amino acid residues and shares 67.6\u201388.4% overall sequence identities with fish and human cathepsin D. Structurally CsCatD possesses an aspartic endopeptidase domain, which contains two conserved aspartic acid residues that form the catalytic site. CsCatL is 336 residues in length and shares 64.7\u201390.2% overall sequence identities with fish and human cathepsin L. CsCatL has an N-terminal cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain followed by a Papain family cysteine protease domain, the latter containing four conserved catalytic residues: Gln-133, Cys-139, His-279, and Asn-303. Recombinant CsCatL purified from Escherichia coli exhibited apparent protease activity. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis detected constitutive expression of CsCatD and CsCatL in multiple tissues, with the lowest level found in heart and the highest level found in liver. Experimental challenge of tongue sole with the bacterial pathogen Vibrio anguillarum and megalocytivirus caused significant inductions of both CsCatD and CsCatL expression in kidney and spleen in time-dependent manners. Immunization of the fish with a subunit vaccine also enhanced CsCatD and CsCatL expression in the first week post-vaccination. These results suggest involvement of CsCatD and CsCatL in host immune reactions to bacterial and viral infections and in the process of antigen-induced immune response.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ling; Zhang, Min; Sun, Li","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04e2a6425a1ce281df05ac8f5f1a5cbed0ab9fd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128119.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464811003482; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464811003482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21939771/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2011.09.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin","D.

Dark-field microscopy, gram-stain microscopy, and chemical identification were used to determine speciation of the collected aerosol from 23 subjects. Three additional subjects were used to test 3 commercial dental or protective masks to determine whether they provide effective protection from the aerosol. RESULTS: Twenty-one species of oral bacteria were identified by the new sampling technique. Two of the 3 masks that were tested offered no protection against the aerosolized bacteria.

A meaningful and deep understanding of the human aspects of software engineering requires psychological constructs to be taken into account. We argue that psychology and statistics theory would facilitate the development and adoption of valid and reliable instruments to assess these constructs. In particular, to ensure high quality, the psychometric properties of measurement instruments need evaluation. In this paper, we provide an introduction to psychometric theory for the evaluation of measurement instruments (e.g., psychological tests and questionnaires) for software engineering researchers. We present guidelines that enable using existing instruments and developing new ones adequately. We conducted a field survey of the psychology literature, including journal articles, textbooks, and society standards, framed by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (American Educational Research Association et al, 2014). We detail activities used when operationalizing new psychological constructs, such as item analysis, factor analysis, standardization and normalization, reliability, validity, and fairness in testing and test bias. With this paper, we hope to encourage a culture change in software engineering research towards the adoption of established methods from social science. To improve the quality of behavioral research, we believe that studies focusing on introducing and psychometrically validating measurement instruments need to be more common.

In particular, we focus on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease, accounting for the control measures, environmental effects, socioeconomic factors, health service resources, and demographic conditions that vary from different counties. In the modeling of an epidemic, mathematical models are useful, however, pure mathematical modeling is deterministic, and only demonstrates the average behavior of the epidemic; thus, it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty. Instead, statistical models provide varieties of characterization of different types of errors. In this paper, we investigate the disease dynamics by working at the interface of theoretical models and empirical data by combining the advantages of mathematical and statistical models. We develop a novel nonparametric space-time disease transmission model for the epidemic data, and to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of COVID-19 at the county level. The proposed methodology can be used to dissect the spatial structure and dynamics of spread, as well as to forecast how this outbreak may unfold through time and space in the future. To assess the uncertainty, projection bands are constructed from forecast paths obtained in bootstrap replications. A dashboard is established with multiple R shiny apps embedded to provide a 7-day forecast of the COVID-19 infection count and death count up to the county level, as well as a long-term projection of the next four months. The proposed method provides remarkably accurate short-term prediction results.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Li; Wang, Guannan; Gao, Lei; Li, Xinyi; Yu, Shan; Kim, Myungjin; Wang, Yueying; Gu, Zhiling","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95b257c452703e55e75f81a5ce126d63db36bbba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14103v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["disease dynamics","mathematical models","spread of COVID","dynamics of spread","statistical models","epidemic data","spatiotemporal dynamics","interface of theoretical models","advantages of mathematical","pure mathematical modeling","forecast paths","day forecast","county level","uncertainty","ongoing public health emergency of COVID","empirical data","novel nonparametric space-time disease transmission model","different counties","projection bands","spatial structure","long-term projection","proposed methodology","health service resources","different types of errors","spatial-temporal pattern","socioeconomic factors","environmental effects","control measures","demographic conditions","accounting","varieties of characterization","accurate short-term prediction results","response","death","multiple R shiny apps","dashboard","bootstrap replications","infection","average behavior","outbreak","future","months","United States","paper"],"language":"en"},

According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yunlu; Hu, Menghan; Li, Qingli; Zhang, Xiao-Ping; Zhai, Guangtao; Yao, Nan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94404b110e8d1d78515c7905093a67246ee5f8a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05534v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tachypnea"],"organizations":["GRU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory pattern of COVID","significant respiratory patterns","respiratory patterns of flu","various respiratory patterns","efficient Respiratory Simulation Model","characteristics of actual respiratory signals","intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns","unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people","proposed deep model","training data","Research significance","deep learning","Tachypnea","great significance","Research details","scarce real-world data","study","outer-class variation","large scale applications","latest clinical research","novel coronavirus","great potential","breathing characteristics","significant symptom","GRU neural network","public places","Accurate detection","attentional mechanisms","Biots","Bradypnea","modeling ideas","Eupnea","sleep scenario","Cheyne-Stokes","epidemic prevention","screening","unobtrusive manner","control period","method","situations","diagnosis","prognosis","RSM","device","Central-Apnea","office environment","depth camera","patients","Demo videos","subjects","paper","goal","rapid respiration","gap","practical use","challenges","task"],"language":"en"},

By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea (2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and cough (1.8-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs.

It is freezing if there is an order on states such that the state evolution of any node is non-decreasing in any orbit. They are commonly used to model epidemic propagation, diffusion phenomena like bootstrap percolation or cristal growth. In this paper we establish how treewidth and maximum degree of the underlying graph are key parameters which influence the overall computational complexity of finite freezing automata networks. First, we define a general model checking formalism that captures many classical decision problems: prediction, nilpotency, predecessor, asynchronous reachability. Then, on one hand, we present an efficient parallel algorithm that solves the general model checking problem in NC for any graph with bounded degree and bounded treewidth. On the other hand, we show that these problems are hard in their respective classes when restricted to families of graph with polynomially growing treewidth. For prediction, predecessor and asynchronous reachability, we establish the hardness result with a fixed set-defiend update rule that is universally hard on any input graph of such families.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goles, Eric; Montealegre, Pedro; R\u0027ios-Wilson, Mart\u0027in; Theyssier, Guillaume","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11758v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["families of graph","underlying graph","input graph","network\u0027s graph","bounded treewidth","general model","bounded degree","prediction","finite set","asynchronous reachability","predecessor","hand","polynomially growing treewidth","local update rule","fixed set-defiend update rule","maximum degree","state evolution","network of entities","overall computational complexity of finite freezing automata networks","classical decision problems","nilpotency","diffusion phenomena","bootstrap percolation","key parameters","node","hardness result","formalism","epidemic propagation","cristal growth","non-decreasing","respective classes","efficient parallel algorithm","orbit","states","neighbors","order","paper"],"language":"en"},

On one side, scientists are focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to demonstrate our model\u0027s generalizability.

In this paper, using WiFi data collected directly from the infrastructure, we present a detailed analysis of the impact of \\virus related policies on the staff and students of three different college campuses. Two of these campuses are in Singapore, while the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our study focuses on two different key metrics, 1) {\\em Occupancy}, defined as the number of people in a building, on average, in a specific hour, and 2) {\\em Mobility}, defined as the number of places visited by an individual, on average, in a specific hour. We use these two metrics since they provide a strong indicator of how likely it is for \\virus to spread if there is an outbreak.

I use simulation by an agent-based model as well as the mathematics of multi-type branching-processes to illustrate how the SS epidemic differs from the more familiar uniform epidemic (e.g., caused by influenza). The conclusions may surprise the reader: (a) The SS epidemic must be described by at least two numbers, such as the mean reproductive number (of\u0022secondary\u0022cases caused by a\u0022primary case\u0022), R0, and the variance of same, call it V0; (b) Even if R0\u003E1, if V0\u003E\u003ER0 the probability that an infection-chain caused by one primary case goes extinct without intervention may be close to one (e.g., 0.97); (c) The SS epidemic may have a long\u0022kindling period\u0022in which sporadic cases appear (transmitted from some unknown host) and generate a cluster of cases, but the chains peter out, perhaps generating a false sense of security that a pandemic will not occur; (d) Interventions such as isolation (or contact-tracing and secondary case isolation) may prove efficacious even without driving R0 below one; (e) The efficacy of such interventions diminishes, but slowly, with increasing V0 at fixed R0. From these considerations, I argue that the SS epidemic has dynamics sufficiently distinct from the uniform case that efficacious public-health interventions can be designed even in the absence of a vaccine or other form of treatment.","publish_time":"2013-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wick, W.

Such is key knowledge for the authorities to prepare for the health systems demand or to apply restrictions to slow down the infectives curve. Even when the model can be easily solved ---by the use of specialized software or by programming the numerical solution of the differential equations that represent the model---, the prediction is a non-easy task, because the behavioral change of people is reflected in a continuous change of the parameters. A relevant question is what we can use of one city to another; if what happened in Madrid could have been applied to New York and then, if what we have learned from this city would be of use for S\\~ao Paulo. With this idea in mind, we present an analysis of a spreading-rate related measure of COVID-19 as a function of population density and population size for all US counties, as long as for Brazilian cities and German cities.

The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by maximum chances of the virus spread.

The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China, Spain, Italy, France, UK, Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown effect.

In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers\u0027 influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across the classification task and the regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients\u0027 lives. Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with 422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods.

Pre-mRNA splicing, furthermore, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of its functional domains. Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between arbitrary nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. A naive implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n^11). Although we were able to reduce this to O(n^6) for many practical applications a further reduction seems difficult. We conclude, therefore, that sampling approaches, which are much easier to implement, are also theoretically favorable for most real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules.","publish_time":"2013-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Backofen, Rolf; Fricke, Markus; Marz, Manja; Qin, Jing; Stadler, Peter F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4cc952118977cd6b27cc08b298173190cd88164.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.7817v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of spatial distances","Large RNA molecules","spatial arrangement","spatial proximity","equilibrium distribution of graph","RNA secondary structure","graph-distance","processing of RNA virus genomes","multiple functional domains","thermodynamic equilibrium","polynomial time","high time complexity of O","practical applications","real-life applications","useful information","recursions","arbitrary nucleotides","long-range interactions","overall shape","important determinant","insights","interplay","crude measure","reduction","dynamic programming","splice junctions","Similar effects","Pre-mRNA splicing","sampling approaches","naive implementation","long introns"],"language":"en"},

Currently, over 210 countries and territories have been affected. Careful, well-designed drugs and vaccine for the total elimination of this virus seem to be the need of the hour. In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling studies can be extremely helpful in understanding the efficacy of the drug interventions. These studies can also help understand the role of the crucial inflammatory mediators and the behaviour of immune response towards this novel coronavirus. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we study the invivo dynamics of Covid-19. The results obtained here are inline with some of the clinical findings for Covid-19. This invivo modelling study involving the crucial biomarkers of Covid-19 is the first of its kind and the results obtained from this can be helpful to researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians and doctors who are working in this field.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chhetri, Bishal; Vamsi, D.

In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve such inverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Libotte, Gustavo Barbosa; Lobato, Fran S\u0027ergio; Platt, Gustavo Mendes; Neto, Antonio Jos\u0027e da Silva","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f63279433037960cfda87006ee01d38b4d79276e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07397v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Differential Evolution","DE","Multi-Objective Differential Evolution"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["optimal control strategy","optimal strategy","optimal control problems","proposed multi-objective optimal control problem","vaccine administration","COVID","Multi-Objective Differential Evolution","pandemic treatment","inverse problem","quantity of infected individuals","quantity of infected people","prescribed vaccine concentration","development of mathematical models","behavior of physical","dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease","set of evidences","effects","mono","Susceptible-Infectious","real data","parameters","compartmental SIR","minimization","strategies","biologic systems","China","algorithms","different types of diseases","results","present days","aim","step","solution","important theme","order","decades","purpose","given criterion","work"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we propose a new hybrid machine learning model, SIRNet, for forecasting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic that couples with the epidemiological models. We use categorized spatiotemporally explicit cellphone mobility data as surrogate markers for physical distancing, along with population weighted density and other local data points. We demonstrate at varying geographical granularity that the spectrum of physical distancing options currently being discussed among policy leaders have epidemiologically significant differences in consequences, ranging from viral extinction to near complete population prevalence. The current mobility inflection points vary across geographical regions. Experimental results from SIRNet establish preliminary bounds on such localized mobility that asymptotically induce containment. The model can support in studying non-pharmacological interventions and approaches that minimize societal collateral damage and control mechanisms for an extended period of time.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soures, Nicholas; Chambers, David; Carmichael, Zachariah; Daram, Anurag; Shah, Dimpy P.; Clark, Kal; Potter, Lloyd; Kudithipudi, Dhireesha","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db3574a611f5e832218c5f14c6f85af06370caf7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10376v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spectrum of physical distancing options","SIRNet","localized mobility","spread","explicit cellphone mobility data","current mobility inflection points","local data points","varying geographical granularity","geographical regions","population weighted density","precipitated varying policies","near complete population prevalence","new hybrid machine learning model","surrogate markers","control mechanisms","viral extinction","societal collateral damage","approaches","preliminary bounds","consequences","policy leaders","pandemic","non-pharmacological interventions","significant differences","couples","extended period of time","globe","Experimental results","infectious outbreak","SARS-CoV","epidemiological models","COVID","study","containment","impact"],"language":"en"},

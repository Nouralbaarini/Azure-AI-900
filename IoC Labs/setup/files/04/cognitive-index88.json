Urinary ACE2 levels increase in diabetes, suggesting that ACE2 may be shed from tubular cells. The aim of this study was to determine if ACE2 is shed from proximal tubular cells, to characterize ACE2 fragments, and to study pathways for shedding. Studies involved primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular cells, with ACE2 activity measured using a synthetic substrate, and analysis of ACE2 fragments by immunoblots and mass spectrometry. The culture media from mouse proximal tubular cells demonstrated a time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity, suggesting constitutive ACE2 shedding. ACE2 was detected in media as two bands at \u223C90 kDa and \u223C70 kDa on immunoblots. By contrast, full-length ACE2 appeared at \u223C100 kDa in cell lysates or mouse kidney cortex. Mass spectrometry of the two deglycosylated fragments identified peptides matching mouse ACE2 at positions 18-706 and 18-577, respectively. The C-terminus of the 18-706 peptide fragment contained a non-tryptic site, suggesting that Met(706) is a candidate ACE2 cleavage site. Incubation of cells in high D-glucose (25 mM) (and to a lesser extent Ang II) for 48\u201372 h increased ACE2 activity in the media (p\u003C0.001), an effect blocked by inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17. High D-glucose increased ADAM17 activity in cell lysates (p\u003C0.05). These data indicate that two glycosylated ACE2 fragments are constitutively shed from mouse proximal tubular cells. ACE2 shedding is stimulated by high D-glucose, at least partly via an ADAM17-mediated pathway. The results suggest that proximal tubular shedding of ACE2 may increase in diabetes, which could enhance degradation of Ang II in the tubular lumen, and increase levels of Ang-(1-7).","publish_time":"2014-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Fengxia; Zimpelmann, Joseph; Agaybi, Samih; Gurley, Susan B.; Puente, Lawrence; Burns, Kevin D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ecb2c48d129fe9df101cb136f9496000d4bb581.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3893316.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3893316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II","ADAM"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse ACE2","full-length ACE2","proximal tubular shedding of ACE2","analysis of ACE2 fragments","glycosylated ACE2 fragments","constitutive ACE2 shedding","Urinary ACE2 levels","h increased ACE2 activity","candidate ACE2 cleavage site","primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular cells","tubular lumen","Incubation of cells","levels of Ang","kidney proximal tubule","kDa","degradation of Ang","High D-glucose increased ADAM17 activity","mouse kidney cortex","deglycosylated fragments","lesser extent Ang","cell lysates","culture media","diabetes","time-dependent increase","mass spectrometry","Angiotensin","study pathways","non-tryptic site","ADAM17-mediated pathway","synthetic substrate","peptides","peptide fragment","disintegrin","Studies","metalloproteinase","inhibition","effect","data","positions","results","bands","contrast","enzyme","C-terminus","aim"],"language":"en"},

We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. METHODS: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P \u003C 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time. CONCLUSIONS: Close contact and long exposure may have contributed to the transmission of 2009 H1N1 virus in the train. Trains may have played an important role in the 2009 influenza pandemic.","publish_time":"2011-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Fuqiang; Luo, Huiming; Zhou, Lei; Yin, Dapeng; Zheng, Canjun; Wang, Dingming; Gong, Jian; Fang, Gang; He, Jianfeng; McFarland, Jeffrey; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8605d9a84e827e232a47861c65c61605c789acf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3899419.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","China"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 cases","contacts of confirmed cases","H1N1 infection","H1N1 virus","asymptomatic cases","passengers","exposure time","Pandemic influenza","influenza pandemic","long exposure","source of infection","Attack rates","travel time","person-hours","Chinese provinces","developed symptoms","public health response","health care providers","possible routes of transmission","RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing","information","crew members","known outbreak","initial reports","CONCLUSIONS","Close contact","retrospective epidemiologic investigation","important role","epidemiology","total","illness","medical monitoring","North America","BACKGROUND","Trains","METHODS","addition","persons","cars","RESULTS","China"],"language":"en"},

Studies thus far have focused on bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens as the source of these diseases; no studies have examined the role of viruses. Using a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 454 pyrosequencing, we compared 24 viral metagenomes generated from Montastraea annularis corals showing signs of WP-like disease and/or bleaching, control conspecific corals, and adjacent seawater. TEM was used for visual inspection of diseased coral tissue. No bacteria were visually identified within diseased coral tissues, but viral particles and sequence similarities to eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA viruses and their associated satellites (SCSDVs) were abundant in WP diseased tissues. In contrast, sequence similarities to SCSDVs were not found in any healthy coral tissues, suggesting SCSDVs might have a role in WP disease. Furthermore, Herpesviridae gene signatures dominated healthy tissues, corroborating reports that herpes-like viruses infect all corals. Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) sequences, similar to those recently identified in cultures of Symbiodinium (the algal symbionts of corals), were most common in bleached corals. This finding further implicates that these NCLDV viruses may have a role in bleaching, as suggested in previous studies. This study determined that a specific group of viruses is associated with diseased Caribbean corals and highlights the potential for viral disease in regional coral reef decline.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soffer, Nitzan; Brandt, Marilyn E; Correa, Adrienne MS; Smith, Tyler B; Thurber, Rebecca Vega","journal":"The ISME Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2639af832e7943cd094b97cd9803655df23605b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3906806.xml.json","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2013137.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WP"],"locations":["Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["diseased coral tissues","WP diseased tissues","diseased Caribbean corals","conspecific corals","bleached corals","role of viruses","NCLDV viruses","healthy coral tissues","diseases of tropical corals","viral disease","SCSDVs","healthy tissues","Montastraea annularis corals","algal symbionts of corals","signs of WP","specific group of viruses","single-stranded DNA viruses","regional coral reef decline","visual inspection of diseased coral tissue","viral particles","viral metagenomes","sequence similarities","TEM","bleaching","previous studies","eukaryotic pathogens","associated satellites","eukaryotic circular Rep","Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus","potential","corroborating reports","sequences","Herpesviridae gene signatures","source","combination of transmission electron microscopy","cultures of Symbiodinium","pyrosequencing","adjacent seawater","contrast","etiological cause","White plague","study","bacteria"],"language":"en"},

Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, \u22120.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population.","publish_time":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Fengchen; Enanoria, Wayne T.

In this study, we evaluated twelve well-known reference genes to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in human lumbar vertebral endplate with Modic changes, by using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Our results showed that the rarely-used SDHA was the most stable single reference gene, and a combination of three, SDHA, B2M, and LDHA, was the most suitable gene set for normalization in all samples. In addition, the commonly-used genes, GAPDH, ACTB and 18S rRNA, were all inappropriate as internal standards. The rankings of reference genes for the three types of Modic change differed, although SDHA and RPL13A uniformly ranked in the first and last position, respectively. Further simulated expression analysis validated that the arbitrary use of a reference gene could lead to the misinterpretation of data.

Variations of environmental factors in shrimp culture ponds usually lead to the outbreak of white spot syndrome (WSS). In order to know the molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak induced by temperature variation and the biological changes of the host at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shrimp with a certain amount of WSSV cultured at 18\u00B0C and shrimp whose culture temperature were raised to 25\u00B0C. To analyze whether the expression changes of the DEGs were due to temperature rising or WSSV proliferation, the expression of selected DEGs was analyzed by real-time PCR with another shrimp group, namely Group T, as control. Group T didn\u2019t suffer WSSV infection but was subjected to temperature rising in parallel. At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated, whereas most DEGs related to cell cycle and positive regulation of cell death and were down-regulated. Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase involved in glycosis were up-regulated, while pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme involved in TCA pathway were down-regulated. Also genes involved in host DNA replication, including DNA primase, DNA topoisomerase and DNA polymerase showed down-regulated expression. Several interesting genes including crustin genes, acting binding or inhibiting protein genes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) gene and a GRP 78 gene were also analyzed. Understanding the interactions between hosts and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will not only help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV but also provide clues for therapies.","publish_time":"2014-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yumiao; Li, Fuhua; Sun, Zheng; Zhang, Xiaojun; Li, Shihao; Zhang, Chengsong; Xiang, Jianhai","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5cc1936183d8b73aa5006487dce09b3f8fe1d65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3942461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WSSV","WSS","Group T","TCA","GRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WSSV infection","WSSV proliferation","pathogenesis of WSSV","initial stage of WSSV acute infection","shrimp group","regulated expression","culture temperature","initial stage of acute infection","crustin genes","interesting genes","shrimp culture ponds","expression of selected DEGs","shrimp culture industry","inhibiting protein genes","DNA primase","DNA polymerase","DNA topoisomerase","temperature variation","Group T","expression changes","host DNA replication","isocitrate dehydrogenase","alcohol dehydrogenase","pyruvate dehydrogenase","outbreak of white spot syndrome","White spot syndrome virus","cell cycle","molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak","biological changes","positive regulation of cell death","acting binding","enolase","NAD","citrate synthase","disintegrin","coenzyme","metalloproteinase domain","RNA-Seq technology","real-time PCR","devastating virosis","Triose phosphate isomerase","Variations of environmental factors","ADAM9","hosts","energy production","glycosis","GRP","clues","deep insight","TCA pathway","order","control","therapies","interactions"],"language":"en"},

It is essential to characterize the influenza A virus-host interaction and develop efficient counter measures against the viral infection. Autophagy is known as a catabolic process for the recycling of the cytoplasmic macromolecules. Recently, it has been shown that autophagy is a critical mechanism underlying the interaction between influenza A virus and its host. Autophagy can be induced by the infection with influenza A virus, which is considered as a necessary process for the viral proliferation, including the accumulation of viral elements during the replication of influenza A virus. On the other hand, influenza A virus can inhibit the autophagic formation via interaction with the autophagy-related genes (Atg) and signaling pathways. In addition, autophagy is involved in the influenza virus-regulated cell deaths, leading to significant changes in host apoptosis. Interestingly, the high pathogenic strains of influenza A virus, such as H5N1, stimulate autophagic cell death and appear to interplay with the autophagy in distinct ways as compared with low pathogenic strains. This review discusses the regulation of autophagy, an influenza A virus driven process.","publish_time":"2014-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Rong; Chi, Xiaojuan; Wang, Song; Qi, Baomin; Yu, Xiaoqiang; Chen, Ji-Long","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0a2b2bc691434ef31983736806d4e558b222c92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3980786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3980786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of influenza","virus-host interaction","influenza virus-regulated cell deaths","virus driven process","regulation of autophagy","high pathogenic strains of influenza","viral infection","autophagy-related genes","widespread infection","viral proliferation","host apoptosis","necessary process","catabolic process","accumulation of viral elements","autophagic cell death","low pathogenic strains","autophagic formation","efficient counter measures","humans","significant changes","dreadful pathogen of animals","H5N1","severe morbidity","distinct ways","recycling","mortality","Atg","critical mechanism","cytoplasmic macromolecules","pathways","review","hand","addition"],"language":"en"},

Parainfluenza virus (PIV) commonly infects patients following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), frequently causing lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD). The definition of LRTD significantly differs among studies evaluating the impact of PIV after HCT. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated 544 HCT recipients with laboratory-confirmed PIV and classified LRTD into 3 groups: possible (PIV detection in upper respiratory tract with new pulmonary infiltrates with/without LRTD symptoms), probable (PIV detection in lung with LRTD symptoms without new pulmonary infiltrates), and proven (PIV detection in lung with new pulmonary infiltrates with/without LRTD symptoms). Results. Probabilities of 90-day survival after LRTD were 87%, 58%, and 45% in possible, probable, and proven cases, respectively. Patients with probable and proven LRTD had significantly worse survival than those with upper respiratory tract infection (probable: hazard ratio [HR], 5.87 [P \u003C .001]; proven: HR, 9.23 [P \u003C .001]), whereas possible LRTD did not (HR, 1.49 [P = .27]). Among proven/probable cases, oxygen requirement at diagnosis, low monocyte counts, and high-dose steroid use (\u003E2 mg/kg/day) were associated with high mortality in multivariable analysis. Conclusions. PIV LRTD with viral detection in lungs (proven/probable LRTD) was associated with worse outcomes than was PIV LRTD with viral detection in upper respiratory samples alone (possible LRTD). This new classification should impact clinical trial design and permit comparability of results among centers.","publish_time":"2014-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Sachiko; Xie, Hu; Campbell, Angela P.; Kuypers, Jane M.; Leisenring, Wendy M.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d12903bea57a10145a8a4879caa0da1494c84728.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4001290.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/58/10/1357/17351409/ciu134.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTD","PIV LRTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PIV LRTD","probable LRTD","proven LRTD","possible LRTD","LRTD symptoms","classified LRTD","definition of LRTD","PIV detection","impact of PIV","probable cases","proven cases","viral detection","new pulmonary infiltrates","HR","upper respiratory tract infection","upper respiratory samples","new classification","lower respiratory tract disease","worse survival","patients","HCT recipients","day survival","worse outcomes","high mortality","permit comparability of results","high-dose steroid use","oxygen requirement","diagnosis","low monocyte counts","clinical trial design","groups","lungs","hazard ratio","laboratory","hematopoietic cell transplantation","studies","multivariable analysis","centers","Parainfluenza virus","Probabilities","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

This study investigated the ability of cellular analysis of BAL fluid to differentially diagnose bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in adult patients who are admitted to intensive care unit. METHODS: BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure. The abilities of BAL fluid total white blood cell (WBC) counts and differential cell counts to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial pneumonia (n = 24) and viral pneumonia (n = 23) were frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid. BAL fluid median total WBC count (2,815/\u00B5L vs. 300/\u00B5L, P\u003C0.001) and percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. In ROC curve analysis, BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.750\u20130.960). BAL fluid total WBC count \u2265510/\u00B5L had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 78.3%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 3.83, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.21. When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity was 95.7%, PLR was 8.63, and NLR was 0.07. BAL fluid total WBC count \u2265510/\u00B5L was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 in multiple logistic regression analysis.

Until now, clinical studies on characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with HFRS have been limited. The aim of this study was to observe the clinical characteristics and cumulative proportions surviving and explore the predictive effects and risk factors for prognosis. METHODS: A detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records for critical HFRS patients was conducted. The patients enrolled were treated in the centre for infectious diseases, Tangdu Hospital, between January 2008 and August 2012. The clinical characteristics between the survivors and non-survivors were compared by Student\u2019s t-test or Chi-square test. The risk clinical factors for prognosis were explored by logistic regression analysis. The predictive effects of prognosis in clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The cumulative proportions surviving at certain intervals in the critical patients were observed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients enrolled, the cumulative proportion surviving was 70.7% at the second week interval, with a 28-day mortality rate of 36.3%. The non-survivors tended to have higher frequencies of agitation, dyspnea, conjunctival hemorrhage, coma, cardiac failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and encephalopathy (P \u003C .05). ARDS, conjunctival hemorrhage and coma were risk factors for death in the critical patients with HFRS. The non-survivors were found to have lower serum creatinine (Scr) levels (P \u003C .001) and higher incidences of prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (P = .006), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P = .003) and elevated white blood cells (WBC) levels (P = .005), and the laboratory parameters mentioned above reached statistical significance for predicting prognosis (P \u003C .05). CONCLUSION: The high fatality in critical patients with HFRS underscores the importance of clinicians\u2019 alertness to the occurrence of potentially fatal complications and changes in biochemical status to ensure that timely and systematically supportive treatment can be initiated when necessary.","publish_time":"2014-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Hong; Wang, Ping-Zhong; Li, Jing; Bai, Lu; Li, Huan; Yu, Hai-Tao; Jiang, Wei; Zhang, Ye; Wang, Jun-Ning; Bai, Xue-Fan","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c0f96d481e138692fcf9b99aa7d9f6b2dc73966.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4020609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFRS","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical patients","critical HFRS patients","clinical characteristics","risk clinical factors","clinical studies","non-survivors","risk factors","predictive effects of prognosis","cumulative proportions","detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records","cumulative proportion surviving","coma","conjunctival hemorrhage","levels","ARDS","laboratory parameters","limited treatment","logistic regression analysis","high incidence","renal syndrome","high fatality","mortality rates","Kaplan-Meier survival analysis","Chi-square test","supportive treatment","higher incidences of prolonged prothrombin time","higher frequencies of agitation","Student\u2019s t-test","partial thromboplastin time","day mortality rate","acute respiratory distress syndrome","cardiac failure","occurrence","WBC","dyspnea","outcomes","fatal complications","death","important public health concern","elevated white blood cells","lower serum creatinine","biochemical status","changes","receiver","centre","Hemorrhagic fever","Scr","importance of clinicians\u2019 alertness","statistical significance","certain intervals","infectious diseases","Tangdu Hospital","BACKGROUND","APTT","encephalopathy","ROC","curves","METHODS","vaccination","CONCLUSION","study","week interval","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

While putative inactivated vaccines are only now undergoing clinical trials, no specific treatment options exist yet. Ideally, EV71 specific intravenous immunoglobulins could be developed for targeted treatment of severe cases. To date, only a single universally neutralizing monoclonal antibody against a conserved linear epitope of VP1 has been identified. Other enteroviruses have been shown to possess major conformational neutralizing epitopes on both the VP2 and VP3 capsid proteins. Hence, we attempted to isolate such neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes for their potential in the treatment of infection as well as differential diagnosis and vaccine optimization. Here we describe a universal neutralizing monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conserved conformational epitope of EV71 which was mapped using escape mutants. Eight escape mutants from different subgenogroups (A, B2, B4, C2, C4) were rescued; they harbored three essential mutations either at amino acid positions 59, 62 or 67 of the VP3 protein which are all situated in the \u201Cknob\u201D region. The escape mutant phenotype could be mimicked by incorporating these mutations into reverse genetically engineered viruses showing that P59L, A62D, A62P and E67D abolish both monoclonal antibody binding and neutralization activity.

Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2), which catalyzes initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation, is also involved in tumor migration and invasion. However, a comprehensive understanding of how ppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the metastasic potential of human gastric cancer is not currently available. In the present study, ppGalNAc-T2 was detected in a variety of human poorly differentiated tumor cells, and expression appeared to be higher in SGC7901 gastric cancer cells. In addition, we investigated the potential effects of ppGalNAc-T2 on growth and metastasis-associated behavior in SGC7901 cells after stable transfection with ppGalNAc-T2 sense and antisense vectors. We found that cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion were decreased in ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells but increased in ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells. Therefore, we attempted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the anti-metastatic activities of ppGalNAc-T2. Further investigation indicated that overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 is involved in the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, which may be associated with ppGalNAc-T2 suppressing the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B21. However, it did not exhibit any apparent correlation with MMP-14 expression levels. Our data show the effect of ppGalNAc-T2 on proliferation, adhesion or invasion of SGC7901 gastric cancer cells, suggesting that ppGalNAc-T2 may exert anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activity through the decrease of MMP-2 and TGF-\u03B21. These results indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 may be used as a novel therapeutic target for human gastric cancer treatment.","publish_time":"2012-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"HUA, DONG; SHEN, LI; XU, LAN; JIANG, ZHI; ZHOU, YINGHUI; YUE, AIHUAN; ZOU, SHITAO; CHENG, ZHIHONG; WU, SHILIANG","journal":"Int J Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d2fae37d61a2e45cf0dff9bc0abee361bbf9a8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4042861.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ppGalNAc-T2 sense","ppGalNAc-T2 correlates","ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells","ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells","effect of ppGalNAc","overexpression of ppGalNAc","potential effects of ppGalNAc","anti-metastatic activities of ppGalNAc","invasion of SGC7901 gastric cancer cells","SGC7901 cells","human gastric cancer treatment","metastasis of cancer","metastasic potential of human gastric cancer","differentiated tumor cells","gastric carcinomas","expression levels","anti-metastatic activity","variety of human","adhesion","expression of transforming growth factor","decrease of MMP","cell proliferation","metastasis-associated behavior","TGF-\u03B21","tumor migration","mRNA levels","Aberrant glycosylation of cell surface glycoprotein","type O-glycosylation","specific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity","stable transfection","novel therapeutic target","initiation of mucin","antisense vectors","inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase","apparent correlation","comprehensive understanding","Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase","mechanisms","present study","addition","investigation","data","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, blood sampling for IgM measurement was done within the first 24 hours from diagnosis in 332 critically ill patients; in 83 patients this was repeated upon progression to more severe stages. Among these 83 patients, 30 patients with severe sepsis progressed into shock and IgM was monitored daily for seven consecutive days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 55 patients and stimulated for IgM production. RESULTS: Serum IgM was decreased in septic shock compared to patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and patients with severe sepsis. Paired comparisons at distinct time points of the sepsis course showed that IgM was decreased only when patients deteriorated from severe sepsis to septic shock. Serial measurements in these patients, beginning from the early start of vasopressors, showed that the distribution of IgM over time was significantly greater for survivors than for non-survivors. Production of IgM by PBMCs was significantly lower at all stages of sepsis compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Specific changes of circulating IgM occur when patients with severe sepsis progress into septic shock. The distribution of IgM is lower among non-survivors.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Apostolidou, Efterpi; Lada, Malvina; Perdios, Ioannis; Gatselis, Nikolaos K; Tsangaris, Iraklis; Georgitsi, Marianna; Bristianou, Magdalini; Kanni, Theodora; Sereti, Kalliopi; Kyprianou, Miltiades A; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Armaganidis, Apostolos","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19fc55dbef34b03dd94cad3565cf48628bfbe842.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4056013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056013/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of IgM","IgM production","Production of IgM","ill patients","IgM measurement","Serum IgM","severe sepsis progress","sepsis course","severe stages","different stages of sepsis","septic shock","Specific changes of circulating IgM","non-survivors","PBMCs","blood sampling","distinct time points","prospective multicenter study","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells","SIRS","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","Paired comparisons","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","early start of vasopressors","diagnosis","healthy controls","progression","kinetics of immunoglobulin","hours","INTRODUCTION","aim","Serial measurements","RESULTS","consecutive days"],"language":"en"},

The PREDICT project, a component of United States Agency for International Development\u2019s Emerging Pandemic Threats program, has introduced capacity building efforts to increase zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife in global \u2018hot spot\u2019 regions where zoonotic disease emergence is likely to occur. Understanding priorities, challenges, and opportunities from the perspectives of the stakeholders is a key component of any successful capacity building program. METHODS: A survey was administered to wildlife officials and to PREDICT-implementing in-country project scientists in 16 participating countries in order to identify similarities and differences in perspectives between the groups regarding capacity needs for zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife. RESULTS: Both stakeholder groups identified some human-animal interfaces (i.e. areas of high contact between wildlife and humans with the potential risk for disease transmission), such as hunting and markets, as important for ongoing targeting of wildlife surveillance. Similarly, findings regarding challenges across stakeholder groups showed some agreement in that a lack of sustainable funding across regions was the greatest challenge for conducting wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens (wildlife officials: 96% and project scientists: 81%). However, the opportunity for improving zoonotic pathogen surveillance capacity identified most frequently by wildlife officials as important was increasing communication or coordination among agencies, sectors, or regions (100% of wildlife officials), whereas the most frequent opportunities identified as important by project scientists were increasing human capacity, increasing laboratory capacity, and the growing interest or awareness regarding wildlife disease or surveillance programs (all identified by 69% of project scientists). CONCLUSIONS: A One Health approach to capacity building applied at local and global scales will have the greatest impact on improving zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife. This approach will involve increasing communication and cooperation across ministries and sectors so that experts and stakeholders work together to identify and mitigate surveillance gaps. Over time, this transdisciplinary approach to capacity building will help overcome existing challenges and promote efficient targeting of high risk interfaces for zoonotic pathogen transmission.","publish_time":"2014-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwind, Jessica S; Goldstein, Tracey; Thomas, Kate; Mazet, Jonna AK; Smith, Woutrina A","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eac75a77af2e437aa8c7ee8b3a6841823fe2694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4096412.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Agency for International Development"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic pathogen surveillance capacity","wildlife officials","wildlife disease","ongoing targeting of wildlife surveillance","human capacity","zoonotic pathogen transmission","capacity needs","laboratory capacity","surveillance programs","surveillance gaps","capacity building efforts","zoonotic pathogens","successful capacity building program","zoonotic disease emergence","country project scientists","regions","increasing communication","stakeholder groups","disease transmission","Health approach","sectors","perspectives","existing challenges","transdisciplinary approach","stakeholders","efficient targeting of high risk interfaces","identification of emerging health threats","human-animal interfaces","International Development\u2019s Emerging Pandemic Threats program","global scales","greatest impact","greatest challenge","key component","potential risk","frequent opportunities","areas of high contact","component of United States Agency","hot spot","participating countries","recognition","humans","similarities","order","ministries","agreement","cooperation","awareness","lack of sustainable funding","differences","agencies","coordination","opportunity","experts","markets","findings","time","survey","CONCLUSIONS","priorities","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

HIV-1 infected cells show limited Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) responsiveness via as yet unknown mechanisms. Using biochemical and biophysical approaches, we demonstrate that the trans-membrane domain (TMD) of the HIV-1 envelope (ENV) directly interacts with TLR2 TMD within the membrane milieu. This interaction attenuates TNF\u03B1, IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion in macrophages, induced by natural ligands of TLR2 both in in vitro and in vivo models. This was associated with decreased levels of ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, mutagenesis demonstrated the importance of a conserved GxxxG motif in driving this interaction within the membrane milieu. The administration of the ENV TMD in vivo to lipotechoic acid (LTA)/Galactosamine-mediated septic mice resulted in a significant decrease in mortality and in tissue damage, due to the weakening of systemic macrophage activation. Our findings suggest that the TMD of ENV is involved in modulation of the innate immune response during HIV infection. Furthermore, due to the high functional homology of viral ENV proteins this function may be a general character of viral-induced immune modulation.","publish_time":"2014-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reuven, Eliran Moshe; Ali, Mohammad; Rotem, Etai; Schwarzter, Roland; Gramatica, Andrea; Futerman, Anthony H.; Shai, Yechiel","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/298ebce4397c9735f69cb5fcf9ad82881eead18f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4133399.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133399/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMD","ENV TMD","ENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ENV TMD","TMD of ENV","TLR2 TMD","immune modulation","HIV infection","membrane milieu","interaction","immune system","high functional homology of viral ENV proteins","innate immune response","trans-membrane domain","general character of viral","natural ligands of TLR2","significant decrease","limited Toll","Receptor","Galactosamine","LTA","lipotechoic acid","tissue damage","septic mice","infected cells","conserved GxxxG motif","MCP","macrophages","responsiveness","importance","mortality","recognition","weakening of systemic macrophage activation","decreased levels of ERK phosphorylation","secretion","TNF\u03B1","biophysical approaches","unknown mechanisms","highjack","pathways","mutagenesis","number","envelope","administration","findings","models"],"language":"en"},

To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this protein\u2019s full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior. Following this initial screening, one region, peptide dens25, had interesting effects on membranes; therefore, we sought to thoroughly characterize this region\u2019s interaction with membranes. This peptide presents an interfacial/hydrophobic pattern characteristic of a membrane-proximal segment.

Pre-mRNA splicing, for instance, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium harbors useful information on the shape of the molecule that in turn can give insights into the interplay of its functional domains. RESULT: Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between a fixed pair of nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. While a na\u00EFve implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n(6)D(5)) for sequence length n and D distinct distance values, it is possible to reduce this to O(n(4)) for practical applications in which predominantly small distances are of of interest. Further reductions, however, seem to be difficult. Therefore, we introduced sampling approaches that are much easier to implement. They are also theoretically favorable for several real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The graph-distance distribution can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graph-distance can be related to the smFRET data.

This study was designed to find non-invasive biomarkers for fibrosis in a clinical context where this process occurs rapidly, HCV-positive patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT). We analyzed 93 LT patients with HCV recurrence, 41 non-LT patients with liver disease showing a fibrosis stage F\u22651 and 9 patients without HCV recurrence who received antiviral treatment before LT, as control group. Blood obtained from 16 healthy subjects was also analyzed. Serum samples were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography and their proteomic profile was analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS. Characterization of the peptide of interest was performed by ion chromatography and electrophoresis, followed by tandem mass spectrometry identification. Marked differences were observed between the serum proteome profile of LT patients with early fibrosis recurrence and non-recurrent LT patients. A robust peak intensity located at 5905 m/z was the distinguishing feature of non-recurrent LT patients. However, the same peak was barely detected in recurrent LT patients. Similar results were found when comparing samples of healthy subjects with those of non-LT fibrotic patients, indicating that our findings were not related to either LT or HCV infection. Using tandem mass-spectrometry, we identified the protein peak as a C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen \u03B1 chain. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that TGF-\u03B2 reduces \u03B1-fibrinogen mRNA expression and 5905 m/z peak intensity in HepG2 cells, suggesting that TGF-\u03B2 activity regulates the circulating levels of this protein fragment. In conclusion, we identified a 5.9 kDa C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen \u03B1 chain as an early serum biomarker of fibrogenic processes in patients with liver disease.","publish_time":"2014-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marf\u00E0, Santiago; Crespo, Gonzalo; Reichenbach, Vedrana; Forns, Xavier; Casals, Gregori; Morales-Ruiz, Manuel; Navasa, Miquel; Jim\u00E9nez, Wladimiro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1542e8e707bd5fa1cb6b3919722fc30ced018c1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4183580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-LT patients","non-LT fibrotic patients","management of patients","serum proteome profile of LT patients","HCV-positive patients","distinguishing feature of non-recurrent LT patients","HCV recurrence","liver disease","early fibrosis recurrence","protein peak","fibrinogen \u03B1 chain","z peak intensity","Serum samples","liver transplantation","protein fragment","HCV infection","robust peak intensity","Early detection of fibrosis progression","\u03B1-fibrinogen mRNA expression","fibrosis stage F","kDa C-terminal fragment","ion chromatography","tandem mass-spectrometry","samples of healthy subjects","early serum biomarker of fibrogenic processes","tandem mass spectrometry identification","TGF-\u03B2 activity","ion exchange chromatography","proteomic profile","antiviral treatment","major relevance","circulating levels","HepG2 cells","electrophoresis","diagnosis","non-invasive biomarkers","clinical context","SELDI-TOF","Cell culture experiments","control group","Characterization","peptide","findings","study","Similar results","differences","Blood","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Here we compared contact network data that were collected in the Netherlands and Thailand using a similar online respondent-driven method. By asking participants to recruit contact persons we studied network links relevant for the transmission of respiratory infections. We studied correlations between recruiter and recruited contacts to investigate mixing patterns in the observed social network components. In both countries, mixing patterns were assortative by demographic variables and random by total numbers of contacts. However, in Thailand participants reported overall more contacts which resulted in higher effective contact rates. Our findings provide new insights on numbers of contacts and mixing patterns in two different populations.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with different environmental influences or certain genetic conditions, and can be artificially induced by inhibitors acting at different steps of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). We found that a short-term (5 h) inhibition of ETC complex III with myxothiazol results in the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03B1 and upregulation of mRNA for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and several ATF4-regulated genes. The changes are characteristic for the adaptive integrated stress response (ISR), which is known to be triggered by unfolded proteins, nutrient and metabolic deficiency, and mitochondrial dysfunctions. However, after a prolonged incubation with myxothiazol (13\u201317 h), levels of ATF4 mRNA and ATF4-regulated transcripts were found substantially suppressed. The suppression was dependent on the p53 response, which is triggered by the impairment of the complex III-dependent de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines by mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The initial adaptive induction of ATF4/ISR acted to promote viability of cells by attenuating apoptosis. In contrast, the induction of p53 upon a sustained inhibition of ETC complex III produced a pro-apoptotic effect, which was additionally stimulated by the p53-mediated abrogation of the pro-survival activities of the ISR. Interestingly, a sustained inhibition of ETC complex I by piericidine did not induce the p53 response and stably maintained the pro-survival activation of ATF4/ISR. We conclude that a downregulation of mitochondrial ETC generally induces adaptive pro-survival responses, which are specifically abrogated by the suicidal p53 response triggered by the genetic risks of the pyrimidine nucleotide deficiency.","publish_time":"2014-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evstafieva, A G; Garaeva, A A; Khutornenko, A A; Klepikova, A V; Logacheva, M D; Penin, A A; Novakovsky, G E; Kovaleva, I E; Chumakov, P M","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c80832ecd995ec182c3a299d48662e65c686fd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4260727.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4260727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complex","pro-survival activation of ATF4","mitochondrial dysfunctions","mitochondrial diseases","downregulation of mitochondrial","induction of p53","levels of ATF4 mRNA","suicidal p53 response","initial adaptive induction of ATF4","ATF4-regulated transcripts","ATF4-regulated genes","adaptive pro-survival responses","mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase","pro-survival activities","sustained inhibition","p53-mediated abrogation","adaptive integrated stress response","mitochondrial electron transport chain","ISR","pro-apoptotic effect","upregulation of mRNA","different steps","genetic risks","metabolic deficiency","myxothiazol results","different environmental influences","certain genetic conditions","activating transcription factor","pyrimidine nucleotide deficiency","phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03B1","novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines","viability of cells","unfolded proteins","physiological regulation","attenuating apoptosis","changes","malfunction","suppression","piericidine","Generation of energy","prolonged incubation","inhibitors","impairment","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Studies to date have focused on the delivery of a single SSO conjugated to a CPP, but here we describe the conjugation of two phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) SSOs to a single CPP for simultaneous delivery and pre-mRNA targeting of two separate genes, exon 23 of the Dmd gene and exon 5 of the Acvr2b gene, in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Conjugations of PMOs to a single CPP were carried out through an amide bond in one case and through a triazole linkage (\u2018click chemistry\u2019) in the other. The most active bi-specific CPP\u2013PMOs demonstrated comparable exon skipping levels for both pre-mRNA targets when compared to individual CPP\u2013PMO conjugates both in cell culture and in vivo in the mdx mouse model.

While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35. These computational models may provide preliminary insights into the molecular features that are responsible for their activity against Ebola virus in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ekins, Sean; Freundlich, Joel S.; Coffee, Megan","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a401eee90cc270520c65bc001f31a617f4edb7df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4304229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4304229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["common features pharmacophore","identified FDA approved drugs","ligand-based pharmacophore models","molecular features","Ebola virus","VP35","protein structures","molecules","activity","computational models","viral protein","possible common target","receptor-ligand pharmacophores","recent structure","co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors","current computational analysis","recent high throughput screens","design project","different structural classes","similar filoviruses","preliminary insights","animal studies","analogs","haemorrhagic fever","global infectious disease crisis","search","amodiaquine","mechanism","indications","antimalarials chloroquine","small molecule","hits","promising biotherapeutics","decades","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis(3,4,5). Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity(6,7,8,9). To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.

We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsV-encapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids.

Although IFN-\u03B2 mRNA is detected within infected cells and supernatant from infected cells show antiviral activity against the replication of other well-known IFN-sensitive viruses, these responses occur at late stages of infection once genome replication has taken place. On the other hand, HAstV replication can be partially reduced by the addition of exogenous IFN, and inhibition of IFN activation by BX795 enhances viral replication, indicating that HAstVs are IFN-sensitive viruses. Finally, different levels of IFN response were observed in cells infected with different HAstV mutants with changes in the hypervariable region of nsP1a/4, suggesting that nsP1a/4 genotype may potentially have clinical implications due to its correlation with the viral replication phenotype and the antiviral responses induced within infected cells.","publish_time":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guix, Susana; P\u00E9rez-Bosque, Anna; Mir\u00F3, Llu\u00EFsa; Moret\u00F3, Miquel; Bosch, Albert; Pint\u00F3, Rosa M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e9ba5b8657f01d92a6da7558aa323fa9ec5539.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4383485.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","delayed IFN response","inhibition of IFN activation","HAstV replication","different levels of IFN response","IFN-\u03B2 mRNA","addition of exogenous IFN","well-known IFN-sensitive viruses","genome replication","viral replication phenotype","antiviral responses","HAstVs","viral infections","different HAstV mutants","antiviral activity","hypervariable region of nsP1a","important agents of acute gastroenteritis","children","changes","supernatant","late stages of infection","infecting CaCo","correlation","subsequent effects","BX795","clinical implications","genotype","place","human astroviruses","hand","interferon"],"language":"en"},

Results were compared with those of a reference control ribavirin. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration values, PGG was 13.4 and 18.0 times more active toward HRV-2 (17.89 \u03BCM) and HRV-4 (17.33 \u03BCM) in MRC5 cells, respectively, than ribavirin.

These constituents inhibited HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), the adsorption period of HRVs, but not after 1 h or later. Moreover, the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. These findings suggest that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication, which may play an important role in interfering with expressions of rhinovirus receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, interferon beta, and IL-1\u03B2), and Toll-like receptor, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV.

DNA vaccine priming improves responses to inactivated influenza vaccines. We describe the rapid production and clinical evaluation of a DNA vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin protein of the 2009 pandemic A/California/04/2009(H1N1) influenza virus, accomplished nearly two months faster than production of A/California/07/2009(H1N1) licensed monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV). METHODS: 20 subjects received three H1 DNA vaccinations (4 mg intramuscularly with Biojector) at 4-week intervals. Eighteen subjects received an optional boost when the licensed H1N1 MIV became available. The interval between the third H1 DNA injection and MIV boost was 3\u201317 weeks. Vaccine safety was assessed by clinical observation, laboratory parameters, and 7-day solicited reactogenicity. Antibody responses were assessed by ELISA, HAI and neutralization assays, and T cell responses by ELISpot and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Vaccinations were safe and well-tolerated. As evaluated by HAI, 6/20 developed positive responses at 4 weeks after third DNA injection and 13/18 at 4 weeks after MIV boost. Similar results were detected in neutralization assays. T cell responses were detected after DNA and MIV. The antibody responses were significantly amplified by the MIV boost, however, the boost did not increased T cell responses induced by DNA vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: H1 DNA vaccine was produced quickly, was well-tolerated, and had modest immunogenicity as a single agent. Other HA DNA prime-MIV boost regimens utilizing one DNA prime vaccination and longer boost intervals have shown significant immunogenicity. Rapid and large-scale production of HA DNA vaccines has the potential to contribute to an efficient response against future influenza pandemics.

There is a prevailing view, however, that the general public is resistant to communications on pandemic influenza and that behavioural responses to the 2009/10 H1N1 pandemic were not sufficient. Using qualitative methods, this paper investigates how members of the general public respond to pandemic influenza and the hygiene, social isolation and other measures proposed by public health. Going beyond the commonly deployed notion that the general public is resistant to public health communications, this paper examines how health individualism, gender and real world constraints enable and limit individual action. METHODS: In-depth interviews (n = 57) and focus groups (ten focus groups; 59 individuals) were conducted with community samples in Melbourne, Sydney and Glasgow. Participants were selected according to maximum variation sampling using purposive criteria, including: 1) pregnancy in 2009/2010; 2) chronic illness; 3) aged 70 years and over; 4) no disclosed health problems. Verbatim transcripts were subjected to inductive, thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents did not express resistance to public health communications, but gave insight into how they interpreted and implemented guidance. An individualistic approach to pandemic risk predominated. The uptake of hygiene, social isolation and vaccine strategies was constrained by seeing oneself \u2018at risk\u2019 but not \u2018a risk\u2019 to others. Gender norms shape how members of the general public enact hygiene and social isolation. Other challenges pertained to over-reliance on perceived remoteness from risk, expectation of recovery from infection and practical constraints on the uptake of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, respondents were engaged with public health advice regarding pandemic influenza, indicating that the idea of public resistance has limited explanatory power. Public communications are endorsed, but challenges persist. Individualistic approaches to pandemic risk inhibit acting for the benefit of others and may deepen divisions in the community according to health status. Public communications on pandemics are mediated by gender norms that may overburden women and limit the action of men. Social research on the public response to pandemics needs to focus on the social structures and real world settings and relationships that shape the action of individuals.","publish_time":"2015-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davis, Mark D M; Stephenson, Niamh; Lohm, Davina; Waller, Emily; Flowers, Paul","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d231458e4949f84dc18a9f3ba99ec980d5ad8f56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4419473.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419473/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Melbourne","Sydney"],"keyphrases":["Public communications","public health communications","public health advice","public health priority","general public response","general public respond","idea of public resistance","pandemic risk","pandemic influenza","health individualism","health status","social isolation","H1N1 pandemic","disclosed health problems","social structures","pandemics","Social research","uptake of hygiene","action of individuals","focus groups","Gender norms shape","real world constraints","members","paper","Respondents","limit individual action","action of men","challenges","real world settings","practical constraints","express resistance","community samples","uptake of vaccination","Individualistic approaches","qualitative methods","perceived remoteness","expectation of recovery","infection","relationships","behavioural responses","over-reliance","maximum variation sampling","purposive criteria","measures","Melbourne","Sydney","women","vaccine strategies","explanatory power","deployed notion","Glasgow","In-depth interviews","RESULTS","divisions","benefit","BACKGROUND","insight","Verbatim transcripts","thematic analysis","chronic illness","pregnancy","Participants","prevailing view","years","CONCLUSIONS","guidance"],"language":"en"},

These results suggest that dieckol exhibits anti-inflammatory effect via the down-regulation of STAT1 activation.","publish_time":"2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Na-Jin; Koo, Dong-Hwan; Kang, Gyeoung-Jin; Han, Sang-Chul; Lee, Bang-Won; Koh, Young-Sang; Hyun, Jin-Won; Lee, Nam-Ho; Ko, Mi-Hee; Kang, Hee-Kyoung; Yoo, Eun-Sook","journal":"Biomol Ther (Seoul)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78dc2abf39a665aec9b4a48738a2b4b838bfe72e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4428716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["C-C","MDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["skin MDC","anti-inflammatory effect of dieckol","Dieckol inhibited MDC","IFN-\u03B3","CCL22 levels","CCL22 production","category of skin inflammation","interferon-\u03B3","atopic dermatitis","inflammatory chemokines","C-C motif chemokine","Macrophage-derived chemokine","nuclear translocation of STAT1","regulation of STAT1 activation","monocyte-derived dendritic cells","inflammatory lymphocytes","stimulated inflammation response","natural killer cells","signal transducers","possible action mechanisms","movement of monocytes","activators of transcription","phosphorylation","keratinocytes","Serum","pathway","ng","results","present study","dose dependent manner","major","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

The low dose of infection suggests that Francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses. Although ~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection, the early interactions of virulent Francisella with the lung environment are not well understood. To provide additional insights into these interactions during early Francisella infection of mice, we performed TEM analysis on mouse lungs infected with F. tularensis strains Schu S4, LVS and the O-antigen mutant Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn. For all three strains, the majority of the bacteria that we could detect were observed within alveolar type II epithelial cells at 16 hours post infection. Although there were no detectable differences in the amount of bacteria within an infected cell between the three strains, there was a significant increase in the amount of cellular debris observed in the air spaces of the lungs in the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant compared to either the Schu S4 or LVS strain. We also studied the interactions of Francisella strains with human AT-II cells in vitro by characterizing the ability of these three strains to invade and replicate within these cells. Gentamicin assay and confocal microscopy both confirmed that F. tularensis Schu S4 replicated robustly within these cells while F. tularensis LVS displayed significantly lower levels of growth over 24 hours, although the strain was able to enter these cells at about the same level as Schu S4 (1 organism per cell), as determined by confocal imaging. The Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant that we have previously described as attenuated for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence displayed interesting properties as well. This mutant induced significant airway inflammation (cell debris) and had an attenuated growth phenotype in the human AT-II cells. These data extend our understanding of early Francisella infection by demonstrating that Francisella enter significant numbers of AT-II cells within the lung and that the capsule and LPS of wild type Schu S4 helps prevent murine lung damage during infection. Furthermore, our data identified that human AT-II cells allow growth of Schu S4, but these same cells supported poor growth of the attenuated LVS strain in vitro. Collectively, these data further our understanding of the role of AT-II cells in Francisella infections.","publish_time":"2015-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faron, Matthew; Fletcher, Joshua R.; Rasmussen, Jed A.; Apicella, Michael A.; Jones, Bradley D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a85cf34eee367f1a73ac62a05779d4c815dc767.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4444194.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Francisella"],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["growth of Schu S4","tularensis Schu S4","tularensis strains Schu S4","Francisella tularensis","epithelial cells","interactions of Francisella strains","understanding of early Francisella infection","O-antigen mutant Schu S4 waaY","early Francisella infection of mice","Francisella infections","LPS of wild type Schu S4","tularensis LVS","early interactions of virulent Francisella","human respiratory infection","TrgTn mutant","low dose of infection","attenuated LVS strain","poor growth","attenuated growth phenotype","data","cell debris","infected cell","lower levels of growth","mutant induced significant airway inflammation","mouse lungs","hours","significant increase","lung environment","significant numbers","organism","bacteria","murine lung damage","low infectious dose","cellular debris","mouse virulence","alveolar type","confocal microscopy","confocal imaging","CDC","macrophages","capsule","TEM analysis","air spaces","interesting properties","possibility","Tier","evading host defenses","additional insights","Gentamicin assay","cfu","role","agent","detectable differences","majority","ability","bioweapon"],"language":"en"},

The treatment through the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon is expensive, only mildly effective, and is associated with severe side effects. In 2011, two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, boceprevir and telaprevir, were licensed that have shown enhanced sustained virologic response (SVR) in phase III clinical trial, however, these interferon-free treatments are more sensitive to HCV genotype 1 infection. The variable nature of HCV, and the limited number of inhibitors developed thus aim in expanding the repertoire of available drug targets, resulting in targeting the virus assembly therapeutically. AIM: We conducted this study to predict the 3D structure of the p7 protein from the HCV genotypes 3 and 4. Approximately 63 amino acid residues encoded in HCV render this channel sensitive to inhibitors, making p7 a promising target for novel therapies. HCV p7 protein forms a small membrane known as viroporin, and is essential for effective self-assembly of large channels that conduct cation assembly and discharge infectious virion particles. METHOD: In this study, we screened drugs and flavonoids known to disrupt translation and production of HCV proteins, targeted against the active site of p7 residues of HCV genotype 3 (GT3) (isolatek3a) and HCV genotype 4a (GT4) (isolateED43). Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship and docking interaction study. RESULTS: The drug NB-DNJ formed the highest number of hydrogen bond interactions with both modeled p7 proteins with high interaction energy, followed by BIT225. A flavonoid screen demonstrated that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), nobiletin, and quercetin, have more binding modes in GT3 than in GT4. Thus, the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential. This structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds, confirming p7 as a new target in the rapidly increasing era of HCV.","publish_time":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathew, Shilu; Fatima, Kaneez; Fatmi, M.

According to the results, the quenching process of salvianolic acid B and hydroxysafflor yellow A was a static quenching procedure through the analysis of quenching data by the Stern-Volmer equation, the modified Stern-Volmer equation, and the modified Scatchard equation. Meanwhile, syringin (Syr) enhanced the fluorescence of BSA, and the data were analyzed using the Lineweaver-Burk equation. Molecular docking suggested that all of these natural components bind to serum albumin at the site I location. Further competitive experiments of SaB confirmed the result of molecular docking studies duo to the displacement of warfarin by SaB. Base on these studies, we selected SaB as a research target because it presented the strongest binding ability to BSA and investigated the influence of the multi-components coexisting in DHI on the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA binding system. The participation of these natural components in DHI affected the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA system. Therefore, when DHI is used in mammals, SaB is released from serum albumin more quickly than it is used alone.

Early recognition of candidate pandemic influenza viruses (CPIV) is of crucial importance for restricting virus transmission and developing appropriate therapeutic and prophylactic strategies including effective vaccines. Often, the pandemic potential of newly emerging IAV is only fully recognized once the virus starts to spread efficiently causing serious disease in humans. Here, we used a novel phylogenetic algorithm based on the informational spectrum method (ISM) to identify potential CPIV by predicting mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene that are likely to (differentially) affect critical interactions between the HA protein and target cells from bird and human origin, respectively. Predictions were subsequently validated by generating pseudotyped retrovirus particles and genetically engineered IAV containing these mutations and characterizing potential effects on virus entry and replication in cells expressing human and avian IAV receptors, respectively. Our data suggest that the ISM-based algorithm is suitable to identify CPIV among IAV strains that are circulating in animal hosts and thus may be a new tool for assessing pandemic risks associated with specific strains.","publish_time":"2015-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmier, Sonja; Mostafa, Ahmed; Haarmann, Thomas; Bannert, Norbert; Ziebuhr, John; Veljkovic, Veljko; Dietrich, Ursula; Pleschka, Stephan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d44ccd4da37549d25e916096ebd616c982af0422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4473683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4473683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV strains","emerging IAV","potential CPIV","engineered IAV","pandemic potential","avian IAV receptors","human health","mutations","human origin","pandemic risks","virus transmission","virus entry","potential effects","ISM-based algorithm","emerging influenza","Early recognition of candidate pandemic influenza viruses","target cells","HA protein","specific strains","novel phylogenetic algorithm","replication","bird","prophylactic strategies","informational spectrum method","major threat","effective vaccines","seasonal epidemics","viral hemagglutinin","crucial importance","pseudotyped retrovirus particles","critical interactions","lack of pre-existing immunity","general population","new tool","animal hosts","serious disease","humans","pandemics","data","Predictions"],"language":"en"},

Schistosoma japonicum, a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts, is one of the major pathogens of this disease. Although numerous studies on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, systematic comparative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles in parasites from different laboratory animals and nature mammalian hosts is lacking to date. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult schistosomes were obtained from laboratory animals BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand white rabbits and the natural host, water buffaloes. The gene expression profiles of schistosomes from these animals were obtained and compared by genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from different laboratory animals and buffaloes were highly consistent (r\u003E0.98) genome-wide. Meanwhile, a total of 450 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in schistosomes which can be clustered into six groups. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. We also identified a group of 1,540 abundantly and stably expressed gene products in adult worms, including a panel of 179 Schistosoma- or Platyhelminthes-specific genes that may be essential for parasitism and may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite intervention targets for future research. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a comprehensive database of gene expression profiles of schistosomes derived from different laboratory animals and water buffaloes. An expanded number of genes potentially affecting the development of schistosomes in different animals were identified. These findings lay the foundation for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural hosts at the transcriptional level and provide a valuable resource for screening anti-schistosomal intervention targets.","publish_time":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shuai; Zhou, Xiaosu; Piao, Xianyu; Wu, Chuang; Hou, Nan; Chen, Qijun","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fe17722a3541e556994dcad8f8d173be7f3ea88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4540470.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4540470/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["different laboratory animals","different animals","laboratory animals BALB","Adult schistosomes","genome expression profiles","development of schistosomes","comprehensive database of gene expression profiles of schistosomes","laboratory animal models","natural hosts","schistosomiasis research","water buffaloes","gene products","wide range of mammalian hosts","genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray analysis","nature mammalian hosts","schistosomiasis japonica","Pathway analysis","Platyhelminthes-specific genes","expanded number of genes","novel potential anti-parasite intervention targets","systematic comparative analysis","screening anti-schistosomal intervention targets","c mice","zoonotic parasite","future research","adult worms","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Schistosoma japonicum","amino acid","valuable resource","energy","C57BL","parasites","New Zealand white rabbits","multiple signal transduction pathways","transcriptional level","study","foundation","panel","METHODOLOGY","lipid metabolism","distributed parasitic diseases","world","SIGNIFICANCE","numerous studies","parasitism","date","results","major pathogens","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","total","groups"],"language":"en"},

This study is part of larger initiative focused on enhancing resilience and preparedness among high risk populations. The purpose of this study was to explore critical issues and strategies to promote resilience and disaster preparedness among people who are homeless in Canada. A sample of interviews (n=21) from key informants across Canada was analyzed to explore existing programs and supports for homeless populations. The data was selected from a larger sample of (n=43) interviews focused on programs and supports for people who are at heightened risk for negative impacts during disasters. Qualitative content analysis was used to extract emergent themes and develop a model of multi-level collaboration to support disaster resilience among people who are homeless. The results indicate there is a need for more upstream continuity planning, collaboration and communication between the emergency management sector and community service organizations that support people who are homeless. Prioritization and investment in the social determinants of health and community supports is necessary to promote resilience among this high-risk population. The findings from this study highlight the importance of acknowledging community support organizations as assets in disaster preparedness.

Exposure to live poultry is a risk factor for H7N9 infection. Public psychobehavioral responses often change during progression of an epidemic. METHODS: We conducted population-based surveys in southern China to examine human exposure to live poultry, and population psychological response and behavioral changes in the two waves. In Guangzhou, an urban area of Guangdong province, we collected data using telephone surveys with random digit dialing in May-June 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. In Zijin county, a rural area of the same province, we used door-to-door surveys under a stratified sampling design in July 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. All responses were weighted by age and sex to the respective adult populations. FINDINGS: Around half of the urban respondents (53.8%) reported having visited LPMs in the previous year in the first survey, around double that reported in the second survey (27.7%). In the rural surveys, around half of the participants reported raising backyard poultry in the past year in the first survey, increasing to 83.2% participants in the second survey. One third of urban subjects supported the permanent closure of LPMs in the first and second surveys, and factors associated with support for closure included female sex, higher level of worry towards H7N9, and worry induced by a hypothetical influenza-like illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated high human exposure to live poultry and low support for permanent closure of markets in both urban and rural residents regardless of increased worry during the epidemic.","publish_time":"2015-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Peng; Wang, Liping; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Yu, Jianxing; Fang, Vicky J.; Li, Fu; Zeng, Lingjia; Wu, Joseph T.; Li, Zhongjie; Leung, Gabriel M.; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b0208d63d06379d846edf649d47041fc2c1aa86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4569561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4569561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guangzhou","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["rural surveys","live poultry","door surveys","telephone surveys","population-based surveys","backyard poultry","urban subjects","rural area","urban respondents","high human exposure","permanent closure of LPMs","urban area of Guangdong province","permanent closure of markets","rural residents","H7N9 infection","increased worry","half","participants","epidemic","winter waves of human infections","higher level of worry","low support","female sex","southern China","past year","novel influenza","previous year","hypothetical influenza","population psychological response","Public psychobehavioral responses","data","risk factor","behavioral changes","study","progression","age","random digit","virus","spring","stratified sampling design","respective adult populations","CONCLUSIONS","Zijin county","emergence","Guangzhou","factors","illness","BACKGROUND","METHODS","FINDINGS","double"],"language":"en"},

Here we show that the C-terminal region of Rpn13 binds to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of SGTA, a cytosolic factor implicated in the quality control of mislocalised membrane proteins (MLPs). The overexpression of SGTA results in a substantial increase in steady-state MLP levels, consistent with an effect on proteasomal degradation. However, this effect is strongly dependent upon the interaction of SGTA with the proteasomal component Rpn13. Hence, overexpression of the SGTA-binding region of Rpn13 or point mutations within the SGTA TPR domain both inhibit SGTA binding to the proteasome and substantially reduce MLP levels. These findings suggest that SGTA can regulate the access of MLPs to the proteolytic core of the proteasome, implying that a protein quality control cycle that involves SGTA and the BAG6 complex can operate at the 19S regulatory particle. We speculate that the binding of SGTA to Rpn13 enables specific polypeptides to escape proteasomal degradation and/or selectively modulates substrate degradation.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leznicki, Pawel; Korac-Prlic, Jelena; Kliza, Katarzyna; Husnjak, Koraljka; Nyathi, Yvonne; Dikic, Ivan; High, Stephen","journal":"J Cell Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4582187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGTA","SGTA TPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SGTA binding","binding of SGTA","domain of SGTA","interaction of SGTA","SGTA-binding region of Rpn13","SGTA TPR domain","overexpression of SGTA results","proteasomal degradation","proteasomal component Rpn13","substrate degradation","C-terminal region of Rpn13","S proteasome regulatory subunit","effect","S regulatory particle","protein quality control cycle","steady-state MLP levels","substrate capture","access of MLPs","quality control of mislocalised membrane proteins","substantial increase","mutations","specific polypeptides","intrinsic ubiquitin receptor","cytosolic factor","tetratricopeptide repeat","proteolytic core","BAG6 complex","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T lymphocytes in 55 biopsies of patients with NSIP to determine the numbers of these T cell subpopulations in lymphoid follicles as well as in perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchial anatomical compartments. The relationship between CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 \u00B1 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 \u00B1 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4\u002B lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883\u20130.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4\u002B T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4\u002B T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue.

Therefore, the routine use of bedside lung ultrasonography for critically ill patients with ARDS is especially valuable. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of ultrasound for lung examination in patients with ARDS. METHODS: Eleven patients infected with H7N9 avian influenza who developed ARDS were diagnosed by lung ultrasonography. RESULTS: Six patients who had severe ARDS showed a diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score \u2265 7 and a lung ultrasound score \u2265 20 points.

In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03B1 and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl(2) compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl(2) concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl(2) concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl(2) affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.","publish_time":"2015-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"ODEWUMI, CAROLINE; LATINWO, LEKAN M.; SINCLAIR, ANDRE; BADISA, VEERA L.D.; ABDULLAH, AHKINYALA; BADISA, RAMESH B.","journal":"Mol Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bb0038a55ff68a2f47a36e8c845126da7fea61b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4626121.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human lung cells","A549 lung cancer cells","higher expression levels","A549 human lung cancer cells","cytokines","higher CdCl","human normal lung","higher levels of inflammation","cytokine levels","expression levels of interleukin","sources of cadmium exposure","mechanism of cadmium toxicity","normal MRC","toxic effect of cadmium","effect of cadmium chloride","higher sensitivity","lowest CdCl","viability assay results","various concentrations","cell viability","longer exposure durations","shorter exposure time","incubation durations","cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits","crystal violet dye binding assay","malfunction of various organs","industrial fumes","Inhalation of cigarette smoke","times","disease","compounds","cytotoxicity","present study","hazardous metal","lungs","liver","kidneys","humans"],"language":"en"},

In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included \u226510 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value \u2265 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.","publish_time":"2015-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bezemer, Daniela; Cori, Anne; Ratmann, Oliver; van Sighem, Ard; Hermanides, Hillegonda S.; Dutilh, Bas E.; Gras, Luuk; Rodrigues Faria, Nuno; van den Hengel, Rob; Duits, Ashley J.; Reiss, Peter; de Wolf, Frank; Fraser, Christophe","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51a7b35db673f0d7cb14a80b607192e3f44cc7f5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ed468ccf95499f1d19c071accb82a8bc64696ace.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4631366.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631366/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATHENA","MSM"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["large MSM-majority clusters","HIV sequences","new clusters","positive MSM","Large transmission clusters","included HIV","long-standing clusters","resurgent HIV epidemic","new generations of MSM","mean age of MSM","ATHENA sequences","ATHENA observational HIV cohort","resurgent epidemic","similar sequences","overall HIV-positive population","high proportion of HIV","Los Alamos sequences","Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database","subtype B epidemic","early epidemic","new sub-epidemics","patients","Netherlands","subtype B polymerase sequences","epidemic threshold value","phylogenetic study of observational data","phylogenetic tree","study period","introduced strains","assumption","higher numbers","combined application of phylogenetic","men","mathematical modeling","cART","Time-varying reproduction numbers","lower mean age","sampled population","recent years","modeling approaches","diagnosis interval distribution","local support value","widespread use of effective combination antiretroviral therapy","countries","sex","care","patristic distance","result","percentile of distances","tendency","cases","growth","total","CONCLUSIONS","Half","Main limitations","Major strengths","BACKGROUND","extent","METHODS","FINDINGS","diagnoses"],"language":"en"},

Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.","publish_time":"2015-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valley-Omar, Ziyaad; Nindo, Fredrick; Mudau, Maanda; Hsiao, Marvin; Martin, Darren Patrick","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec9faa32c45199e8fec10c7a0d3bae3dd0275744.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4643913.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzcyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cape Town South Africa"],"keyphrases":["multiple hospital","influenza nosocomial transmission","nosocomial transmission investigation","epidemiological transmission linkage of patients","paediatric Hospital","epidemiological data","hospital staff","Common hospital","Possible transmission chains","possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission","traditional epidemiological investigation","patient transmission chains","asymptomatic hospital patients","possible transmission pathways","extent of nosocomial transmission","instances of potential hospital","number of possible transmission events","individual hospital wards","viral sequence data","traditional epidemiological analysis","viral phylogenetic analyses","multiple introductions of Influenza","multiple unique introductions of influenza","non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation","limited number of identifiable index viral isolates","number of unique infections","basic patient admission data","influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies","different patients","sequencing data","Traditional modes","patient co-admission","infection instances","time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses","specific wards","discerning ability","particular time-frame","virus hemagglutinin sequences","combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing","Maximum likelihood","Cape Town South Africa","month period","channels","visitors","functional role","general inability","unrelated cases","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In the last decade millions of cases have been reported around the world from Africa to Asia to the Americas. The alphavirus nsP2 protein is multifunctional and is considered to be pivotal to viral replication, as the nsP2 protease activity is critical for proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein during replication. Classically the alphavirus nsP2 protease is thought to be papain-like with the enzyme reaction proceeding through a cysteine/histidine catalytic dyad. We performed structure-function studies on the chikungunya nsP2 protease and show that the enzyme is not papain-like. Characterization of the catalytic dyad cysteine residue enabled us to identify a nearby serine that is catalytically interchangeable with the dyad cysteine residue. The enzyme retains activity upon alanine replacement of either residue but a replacement of both cysteine and serine residues results in no detectable activity. Protein dynamics appears to allow the use of either the cysteine or the serine residue in catalysis. This switchable dyad residue has not been previously reported for alphavirus nsP2 proteases and would have a major impact on the nsP2 protease as an anti-viral target.","publish_time":"2015-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saisawang, Chonticha; Saitornuang, Sawanan; Sillapee, Pornpan; Ubol, Sukathida; Smith, Duncan R.; Ketterman, Albert J.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02bfb4c09489a5f48c23e8441e37b055bf7228ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4657084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Asia"],"keyphrases":["nsP2 protease activity","chikungunya nsP2 protease","alphavirus nsP2 protein","catalytic dyad cysteine residue","alphavirus nsP2 proteases","switchable dyad residue","viral replication","pathogenic alphavirus","histidine catalytic dyad","detectable activity","viral polyprotein","chikungunya fever","Chikungunya virus","nearby serine","enzyme reaction","papain","serine residues results","anti-viral target","alanine replacement","Protein dynamics","proteolytic processing","major impact","structure-function studies","Characterization","Africa","Asia","world","use","humans","catalysis","decade millions of cases","Americas"],"language":"en"},

In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed.

Among the complex taxa, Cx. pipiens (with two forms pipiens and molestus) and Cx. quinquefasciatus are the most ubiquitous mosquitoes in temperate and tropical regions respectively. Mosquitoes of this taxa lack of morphological differences between females, but have frank behavioral and physiological differences and have different trophic preferences that influence their vectorial status. Hybridization may change the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes, increasing vector efficiency and medical importance of resulting hybrids. METHODS: Culex pipiens s.l. from 35 distinct populations were investigated by the study of mtDNA, symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, nuclear DNA and flanking region of microsatellite CQ11 polymorphism using PCR with diagnostic primers, RFLP analysis and sequencing. RESULTS: Six different mitochondrial haplotypes were revealed by sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and three different Wolbachia (wPip) groups were identified. A strong association was observed between COI haplotypes/groups, wPip groups and taxa; haplogroup A and infection with wPipII appear to be typical for Cx. pipiens form pipiens, haplotype D and infection with wPipIV for form molestus, while haplogroup E, characteristic of Cx. quinquefasciatus, were correlated with wPipI and found in Cx. pipiens sl. from coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Analysis of microsatellite locus and nuclear DNA revealed hybrids between Cx. pipiens form pipiens and form molestus, as well as between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus, in Mediterranean populations, as opposed to Northern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences yielded a tree topology that supported the RFLP analysis with significant bootstrap values for haplotype D and haplogroup E. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular identification provides the first evidence of the presence of hybrids between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens as well as cytoplasmic introgression of Cx. quinquefasciatus into Cx. pipiens as a result of hybridization events in coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Together with observed hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, these findings point to the presence of hybrids in these areas, with consequent higher potential for disease transmission.

Here, with a view to understanding the underlying mechanisms, we first systematically dissected the exact signaling network in BTV-induced autophagy. We found that the activity of mTOR, a crucial pivot, was inhibited by BTV1 infection, subsequently leading to downstream p70S6K suppression and autophagy initiation. We then explored the upstream regulators of mTOR and analyzed their activities via a series of assays. We found BTV1-induced autophagy to be independent of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, the BTV1-induced inhibition of PI3K/Akt was found to be partially responsible for mTOR inactivation and subsequent autophagy initiation. Furthermore, we found unexpectedly that AMPK seemed to play a more important role in BTV1-induced autophagy. Elevated [Ca(2\u002B)](cyto)-mediated activation of CaMKK\u03B2 exactly managed the activation of AMPK, which then positively regulated autophagy through suppressing mTOR. We must emphasize that TSC2 is a fatal mediator between upstream Akt or AMPK and downstream mTOR through its phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggested that the BTV1-induced inhibition of the Akt-TSC2-mTOR pathway and the upregulation of the AMPK-TSC2-mTOR pathway both contributed to autophagy initiation and further favored virus replication.","publish_time":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Shuang; Xu, Qing-Yuan; Sun, En-Cheng; Zhang, Ji-Kai; Wu, Dong-Lai","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08741b63c08d63c1a86dd3ef3ce3d1bfd39e560b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4791558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt","AMPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BTV1-induced autophagy","BTV-induced autophagy","mTOR pathway","downstream mTOR","regulated autophagy","cellular autophagy","mTOR inactivation","subsequent autophagy initiation","activity of mTOR","suppressing mTOR","AMPK-TSC2","upstream regulators of mTOR","BTV1-induced inhibition of PI3K","Akt-TSC2","activation of AMPK","BTV1 infection","upstream Akt","virus replication","Bluetongue virus","segmented RNA virus","downstream p70S6K suppression","mediated activation of CaMKK\u03B2","complex double","fatal mediator","upregulation","crucial pivot","important role","activities","network","cyto","ERK1","phosphorylation","view","underlying mechanisms","series of assays","benefit","data"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8(\u002B) T cells (which express \u03B14\u03B27 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa. Porcine T-cells expressed \u03B27 integrin and CCR9 receptors and migrated to CCL25 by a mechanism that was dependent of activation by RA-pretreated DCs, rather than direct activation by RA.

Soluble ACE2 fragments are shed from the proximal tubule, and appear at high levels in the urine with diabetes. High glucose-induced shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by the enzyme \u201Ca disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17\u2033 (ADAM17). Here, we investigated the mechanism for constitutive shedding of ACE2. Mouse proximal tubular cells were cultured and ACE2 shedding into the media was assessed by enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors, or transfected with silencing (si) RNA. Incubation of proximal tubular cells with increasing concentrations of D-glucose stimulated ACE2 shedding, which peaked at 16 mM, while L-glucose (osmotic control) had no effect on shedding. In cells maintained in 7.8 mM D-glucose, ACE2 shedding was significantly inhibited by the pan-protein kinase C (PKC) competitive inhibitor sotrastaurin, but not by an inhibitor of ADAM17. Incubation of cells with the PKC-\u03B1 and -\u03B21-specific inhibitor Go6976, the PKC \u03B21 and \u03B22-specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-2,-8, and -9, or an inhibitor of ADAM10 (GI250423X) had no effect on basal ACE2 shedding. By contrast, the PKC-\u03B4 inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited both constitutive and high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding. Transfection of cells with siRNA directed against PKC-\u03B4 reduced ACE2 shedding by 20%, while knockdown of PKC-\u03B5 was without effect. These results indicate that constitutive shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by PKC-\u03B4, which is also linked to high glucose-induced shedding. Targeting PKC-\u03B4 may preserve membrane-bound ACE2 in proximal tubule in disease states and diminish Ang II-stimulated adverse signaling.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Fengxia; Zimpelmann, Joseph; Burger, Dylan; Kennedy, Christopher; H\u00E9bert, Richard L.; Burns, Kevin D.","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ea6973e872fb9116a21c6539d2aba2ea5c1337c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4887483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887483/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["constitutive shedding of ACE2","basal ACE2 shedding","glucose stimulated ACE2 shedding","High glucose-induced shedding of ACE2","high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding","PKC \u03B21","Incubation of proximal tubular cells","Incubation of cells","Mouse proximal tubular cells","PKC-\u03B4 inhibitor rottlerin","membrane-bound ACE2","Soluble ACE2 fragments","PKC-\u03B1","knockdown of PKC","Transfection of cells","proximal tubule","D-glucose","inhibitor of ADAM17","inhibitor of ADAM10","effect","\u03B21-specific inhibitor Go6976","competitive inhibitor sotrastaurin","\u03B22-specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin","high levels","Angiotensin","enzyme activity assay","pharmacologic inhibitors","increasing concentrations of D","inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases","disease states","pan-protein kinase C","silencing","GI250423X","media","siRNA","osmotic control","analysis","urine","diabetes","contrast","mechanism","results","diabetic renal injury","disintegrin"],"language":"en"},

Self-administered, anonymous surveys were performed by hard copy questionnaires in public hospitals, and by an on-line platform available to all healthcare professionals, from April 1st to May 31st, 2015. A total of 1290 healthcare professionals completed the questionnaires, including doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals working in both the public and private systems. Only 31.8% of participating respondents expressed an intention to receive the additional vaccine, despite that the majority of them agreed or strongly agreed that it would bring benefit to the community (88.9%), save lives (86.7%), reduce medical expenses (76.3%), satisfy public expectation (82.8%), and increase awareness of vaccination (86.1%). However, a significant proportion expressed concern that the vaccine could disturb the normal immunization schedule (45.5%); felt uncertain what to do in the next vaccination round (66.0%); perceived that the summer peak might not occur (48.2%); and believed that the summer peak might not be of the same virus (83.5%). Furthermore, 27.8% of all respondents expected that the additional vaccination could weaken the efficacy of previous vaccinations; 51.3% was concerned about side effects; and 61.3% estimated that there would be a low uptake rate. If the supply of vaccine was limited, higher priority groups were considered to include the elderly aged \u226565 years with chronic medical conditions (89.2%), the elderly living in residential care homes (87.4%), and long-stay residents of institutions for the disabled (80.7%). The strongest factors associated with accepting the additional vaccine included immunization with influenza vaccines in the past 3 years, higher perceived risk of contracting influenza, and higher perceived severity of the disease impact. The acceptability to an additional ad hoc influenza vaccination was low among healthcare professionals. This could have a negative impact on such additional vaccination campaigns since healthcare professionals are a key driver for vaccine acceptance. The discordance in perceived risk and acceptance of vaccination regarding self versus public deserves further evaluation.","publish_time":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Martin C.S.; Nelson, E.

Like siRNAs, shRNAs show promise as potential therapeutic agents due to their high level of specificity and potency, although effective delivery to target tissues remains a challenge. Algorithms used to predict siRNA performance are frequently used to design shRNAs as well. However, the differences between these two kinds of RNAi mediators indicate that the factors affecting target gene silencing will not be the same for siRNAs and shRNAs. Stem and loop lengths, structures of the termini, the identity of nucleotides adjacent to and near the loop, and the position of the guide (antisense) strand all affect the efficacy of shRNAs. In addition, shRNAs with 19-bp or shorter stem lengths are processed and function differently than those with longer stems. In this review, we describe studies of targeting the hepatitis C virus that have provided guidelines for an optimal design for short (19 bp) shRNAs (sshRNAs) that are highly potent, stable in biological fluids, and have minimal immunostimulatory properties.","publish_time":"2012-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnston, Brian H.; Ge, Qing","journal":"From Nucleic Acids Sequences to Molecular Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36e5c51920fa3c447a4bb6e7bddd19258162ab06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138429.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of shRNAs","bp","loop lengths","shorter stem lengths","duplex stem","target gene silencing","siRNAs","gene silencing tools","optimal design","guidelines","termini","potential therapeutic agents","biological fluids","high level of specificity","potency","function","factors","promise","structures","effective delivery","studies","hepatitis C virus","identity of nucleotides adjacent","strand","minimal immunostimulatory properties","kinds of RNAi mediators","tissues","dinucleotide overhang","position","Small hairpin RNAs","sshRNAs","siRNA performance","Algorithms","end","differences","longer stems","challenge","addition","review"],"language":"en"},

Clinical manifestations of yeast and endemic fungal infections vary in different types of organ transplants. Diagnosis of IFIs in SOT recipients is challenging due to their nonspecific signs and symptoms owing to the impaired inflammatory responses as a result of immunosuppression and the lack of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic modalities.

When the virus was formally identified as Ebola, epidemiologists started to investigate the chains of transmission, while local people were trying to make sense out of these deaths. The epidemic control measures taken by national and international health agencies were soon faced by strong reluctance and a sometimes aggressive attitude of the affected communities. Based on ethnographic work in Macenta (Forest region) in the autumn of 2014 for the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN) of the World Health Organization, this chapter shows that while epidemiologists involved in the outbreak response attributed the first Ebola deaths in the Forest region to the transmission of a virus from an unknown animal reservoir, local citizens believed these deaths were caused by the breach of a taboo. Epidemiological and popular explanations, mainly evolving in parallel, but sometimes overlapping, were driven by different explanatory models: a biomedical model embodying nature in the guise of an animal disease reservoir, which in turn poses as threat to humanity, and a traditional-religious model wherein nature and culture are not dichotomized. The chapter will argue that epidemic responses must be flexible and need to systematically document popular discourse(s), rumours, codes, practices, knowledge and opinions related to the outbreak event.

This case report involves a patient having the classical symptoms of fever, Purpura and Edema, but with an unusual extensive truncal involvement. Moreover, Rhinovirus infection testing was positive in the child\u2019s case. The presence of the virus gives a suspicion of being the possible trigger for the boy\u2019s AHE.

The procedure is described with the human RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). The Northwestern RNA blot assay provides an efficient approach for the identification of regions of a protein responsible for its RNA-binding activity. The strategy for the measurement of RNA-binding activity by Northwestern analysis involves the immobilization of target proteins on a filter membrane. Proteins fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) are electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter membrane by standard techniques. The fiber-bound proteins are then analyzed for RNA-binding activity using a radioactive RNA probe; this RNA-protein blot analysis constitutes the Northwestern assay. Subsequently, a Western immunoblot analysis is carried out using the same filter membrane as is used for the Northwestern analysis to verify that comparable amounts of test proteins are present. The Western analysis is especially important in the cases of proteins that do not register as RNA-binding proteins in the Northwestern assay.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCormack, Stephen J.; Samuel, Charles E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147882/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of RNA","RNA-binding proteins","RNA-binding activity","Northwestern analysis","Northwestern RNA blot assay","measurement of RNA","RNA-protein blot analysis","Northwestern assay","radioactive RNA probe","cases of proteins","human RNA-dependent protein kinase","immobilization of target proteins","fiber-bound proteins","nitrocellulose filter membrane","comparable amounts of test proteins","protein responsible","procedure","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","sodium dodecyl sulfate","efficient approach","SDS-PAGE","identification of regions","standard techniques","PKR","strategy","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Its regulation during different stages of growth, division, differentiation, development, aging, and death is a crucial aspect of a living system. In order to translate one mRNA molecule transcribed from a gene, almost 200 small and large components are required to function effectively and accurately, while using large quantities of cellular energy. Ribosomes, initiation factors, elongation factors, amino acids, tRNAs, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the major components of the protein synthetic apparatus. Protein synthesis proceeds in three steps\u2014initiation, elongation, and termination, followed by posttranslational modifications. The rate-limiting factors for the regulation of total protein synthesis can be any of the components of the protein synthetic machinery. The availability of mRNA and the amounts and activities of ribosomes, initiation factors, and elongation factors are the major regulators of protein synthesis. Posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation of various protein synthetic components are involved in determining their activity and stability.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rattan, Suresh I.S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c72aed97f4385024fffe9589840c60a1f306a2f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elongation factors","initiation factors","Protein synthesis proceeds","protein synthetic apparatus","protein synthetic machinery","major regulators of protein synthesis","regulation of total protein synthesis","phosphorylation of various protein synthetic components","major components","large components","posttranslational modifications","activities of ribosomes","mRNA molecule","availability of mRNA","large quantities of cellular energy","tRNAs","amino acids","division","aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases","aging","development","differentiation","different stages of growth","amounts","steps","crucial aspect","death","gene","termination","living system","complex processes","order","activity","rate","stability"],"language":"en"},

We show that, for the tasks of systematic review screening prioritisation and stopping estimation, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning to rank and bag-of-words-based systems for this domain. Our fully automatic, unsupervised method has (i) the potential for significant real-world cost savings (ii) does not rely on any intervention from the user, and (iii) is significantly better at ranking documents given only a Boolean query in the context of systematic reviews when compared to other approaches.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scells, Harrisen; Zuccon, Guido; Koopman, Bevan","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d151a96d942ff6656e7f7979de98c2656802859.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ranking method","ranking documents","Rank fusion","recent method","unsupervised method","Boolean query","single ranking","Coordination level matching","Boolean queries","multiple systems","context of systematic reviews","words-based systems","tasks of systematic review screening prioritisation","potential","estimation","runs","novel extension","sub-clause","bag","significant real-world cost savings","domain","paper","state-of-the-art learning","decades old","approaches","intervention","user"],"language":"en"},

This is for example the case for multilingual collections where documents are not available in all languages. Some studies tackled this problem by assuming the existence of view generation functions to approximately complete the missing views; for example Machine Translation to translate documents into the missing languages. These functions generally require an external resource to be set and their quality has a direct impact on the performance of the learned multiview classifier over the completed training set. Our proposed approach addresses this problem by jointly learning the missing views and the multiview classifier using a tripartite game with two generators and a discriminator. Each of the generators is associated to one of the views and tries to fool the discriminator by generating the other missing view conditionally on the corresponding observed view. The discriminator then tries to identify if for an observation, one of its views is completed by one of the generators or if both views are completed along with its class. Our results on a subset of Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collections show that the discriminator achieves significant classification performance; and that the generators learn the missing views with high quality without the need of any consequent external resource.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doinychko, Anastasiia; Amini, Massih-Reza","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6c153916c474f1531736a3d7e1e26575c297885.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reuters"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["missing views","generators","missing languages","common discriminator","completed training set","learned multiview classifier","documents","multiview learning problems","existence of view generation functions","corresponding observed view","consequent external resource","multilingual collections","RCV2 collections","high quality","training samples","example Machine Translation","significant classification performance","need","subset of Reuters RCV1","observations","tripartite game","case","direct impact","conditional GAN","results","paper","proposed approach","studies"],"language":"en"},

Since these models are based on direct term matching, their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions. Although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness, respectively, have been reported in recent literature, the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Knowledge graph Entity and Word Embedding for Retrieval (KEWER), a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low-dimensional vector space, which takes into account a knowledge graph\u2019s local structure and structural components, such as entities, attributes, and categories, and is designed specifically for entity search. KEWER is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods. Similar to word embedding methods, KEWER utilizes contextual co-occurrences as training data, however, it treats words and entities as different objects. Similar to network embedding methods, KEWER takes into account knowledge graph\u2019s local structure, however, it also differentiates between structural components. Experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state-of-the-art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of KEWER and BM25F results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over BM25F alone.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikolaev, Fedor; Kotov, Alexander","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KEWER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entity search","knowledge graph entity embeddings","available entity","entity descriptions","knowledge graph noisiness","state-of-the-art word","hybrid of word","methods","utility of joint word","account knowledge graph\u2019s local structure","successful applications of word embeddings","combination of KEWER","knowledge graphs of varying complexity","entities","retrieval accuracy","document retrieval","ad","words","structural components","network","emergence of novel models","BM25F results","novel method","recent literature","Recent years","issues of vocabulary mismatch","benchmarks","consistent improvement","contextual co-occurrences","training data","low-dimensional vector space","direct term matching","vocabularies","queries","incompleteness","random walks","attributes","different objects","Experiments","paper","categories"],"language":"en"},

This is exploited in sentiment analysis where machine learning models are used to predict the review score from the text of the review. Furthermore, the products costumers have purchased in the past are indicative of the products they will purchase in the future. This is what recommender systems exploit by learning models from purchase information to predict the items a customer might be interested in. The underlying structure of this problem setting is a bipartite graph, wherein customer nodes are connected to product nodes via \u2018review\u2019 links. This is reminiscent of knowledge bases, with \u2018review\u2019 links replacing relation types. We propose TransRev, an approach to the product recommendation problem that integrates ideas from recommender systems, sentiment analysis, and multi-relational learning into a joint learning objective. TransRev learns vector representations for users, items, and reviews. The embedding of a review is learned such that (a) it performs well as input feature of a regression model for sentiment prediction; and (b) it always translates the reviewer embedding to the embedding of the reviewed item. This is reminiscent of TransE [5], a popular embedding method for link prediction in knowledge bases. This allows TransRev to approximate a review embedding at test time as the difference of the embedding of each item and the user embedding. The approximated review embedding is then used with the regression model to predict the review score for each item. TransRev outperforms state of the art recommender systems on a large number of benchmark data sets. Moreover, it is able to retrieve, for each user and item, the review text from the training set whose embedding is most similar to the approximated review embedding.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Dur\u00E1n, Alberto; Gonz\u00E1lez, Roberto; O\u00F1oro-Rubio, Daniel; Niepert, Mathias; Li, Hui","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85a0d2585c68e711c39dbac8a5ad8cdcf40960ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approximated review embedding","review text","review score","popular embedding method","TransRev","sentiment analysis","sentiment prediction","customer nodes","product nodes","reviewed item","art recommender systems","machine learning models","multi-relational learning","joint learning objective","product recommendation problem","regression model","particular product","items","links","reminiscent of knowledge bases","problem setting","link prediction","purchase information","products costumers","reminiscent of TransE","ideas","large number of benchmark data sets","users","bipartite graph","past","vector representations","approach","difference","state","training","underlying structure","input feature","test time","relation types","reviews","reviewer","future"],"language":"en"},

From an information retrieval perspective, an interesting task within this setting is finding the best supporting and attacking premises for a given query claim from a large corpus of arguments. Since the same logical premise can be formulated differently, the system needs to avoid retrieving duplicate results and thus needs to use some form of clustering. In this paper we propose a principled probabilistic ranking framework for premises based on the idea of tf-idf that, given a query claim, first identifies highly similar claims in the corpus, and then clusters and ranks their premises, taking clusters of claims as well as the stances of query and premises into account.

Cells infected with Herpes Simplex Virus\u20101 (HSV\u20101), but not uninfected cells, exhibit nuclear staining upon the addition of dF\u2010EdU and a fluorescent azide. The incorporation of the dF\u2010EdU into DNA depends on its phosphorylation by a herpes virus thymidine kinase (TK). Crystallographic analyses revealed how dF\u2010EdU is well accommodated in the active site of HSV\u20101 TK, but steric clashes prevent dF\u2010EdU from binding human TK.

The benefits of such systems include multivalency, self\u2010adjuvanting properties, and more specific immune responses. Previously, the design, synthesis, and characterization of self\u2010assembling peptide cages (SAGEs) have been reported. In these, de novo peptides are combined to make hubs that assemble into nanoparticles when mixed in aqueous solution. Here it is shown that SAGEs are nontoxic particles with potential as accessible synthetic peptide scaffolds for the delivery of immunogenic components. To this end, SAGEs functionalized with the model antigenic peptides tetanus toxoid(632\u2010651) and ovalbumin(323\u2010339) drive antigen\u2010specific responses both in vitro and in vivo, eliciting both CD4(\u002B) T cell and B cell responses. Additionally, SAGEs functionalized with the antigenic peptide hemagglutinin(518\u2010526) from the influenza virus are also able to drive a CD8(\u002B) T cell response in vivo.

Leading dominant species, from the dry end to the wet end of the ordination gradient, were Cornus florida, Pinus palustris, Quercus nigra, Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa sylvatica v. sylvatica, Magnolia virginiana, and N. sylvatica v. biflora. Two important seral species, most prominent at the middle of the ordination gradient and of relatively little importance at either end, were Pinus elliottii and Liriodendron tulipifera. The stand position on the ordination gradient, referred to as the moisture\u2014regime index, was significantly related to water\u2014table depth, soil\u2014surface gradient, and soil pH at 63.5 cm. Failure to obtain significant relationship with other soil variables was attributed to the high frequency of fresh soil deposition in the small stream bottoms. As a check on the ordination analysis, species\u2014present data were used to construct a species\u2014correlation diagram.

The bricoleur frames conditions as a problem that can and must be fixed and emerges as the one who looks for a solution. For the bricoleur outcome goals, or rather, the choice of a particular outcome is less important than the process goal. Therefore, the bricoleur selects policy ideas depending on the properties they display and combines them to create the best \u201Cfit\u201D to couple the streams. Bricolage relates to the organizational properties of certain actors, in this case the European Commission. Evidence comes from the case of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and its origins, created in the aftermath of the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis. I will demonstrate that the crisis did not trigger the creation of the ECDC but rather was framed as a salient issue to be resolved by the Commission.

Dispersing beetles were (rapped in light\u2010reflecting glass traps. Both species are univoltine and breed in the spring. The populations of adult H. brevipalpis are largest during the summer when great numbers emerge and migrate. Very few H. strigifrons adults emerge before spring. Its adult populations are largest in the spring, and small numbers of mature individuals fly with mature H. brevipalpis specimens. This is discussed in relation to their habitat utilization: H. sirigifrons inhabits permanent waters only and is dimorphic for flight musculature. H. brevipalpis inhabits both permanent and ephemeral waters and is always equipped with a functioning flight apparatus. H. brevipalpis is an effective colonizer of ephemeral waters due to its large dispersal capacity and to the fact that the habitat of juveniles differs from that of adults. Age, sexual maturation and feeding in flying and non\u2010flying groups are compared. Food is seldom found in the gut of fliers of either species. In the spring flying H. brevipalpis females have larger oocytes than non\u2010flying ones; flying H. strigifrons females have smaller oocytes than non\u2010fliers. It is possible that the summer migrations of H. brevipalpis favour outbreeding since fliers are sexually immature; spring fliers, being sexually mature, are more efficient as colonizers.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Landin, Jan","journal":"Ecography (Cop.)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb401b570f0adcad503e6057219b146378887e0d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spring flying","spring fliers","brevipalpis females","non\u2010fliers","brevipalpis specimens","non\u2010flying ones","non\u2010flying groups","brevipalpis favour outbreeding","permanent waters","gut of fliers","populations of adult","adult populations","strigifrons females","strigifrons adults","Helophorus species","small numbers of mature individuals","effective colonizer of ephemeral waters","larger oocytes","smaller oocytes","summer migrations of","habitat utilization","great numbers","habitat of juveniles","flight musculature","functioning flight apparatus","fact","large dispersal capacity","Swedish lake","sirigifrons","ice\u2010free periods","reflecting glass traps","univoltine","sexual maturation","Age","Dispersing beetles","years","relation","colonizers","Food"],"language":"en"},

Simultaneously, zoological gardens have undergone a revolution in philosophy and design, resulting in a proliferation of \u201Cnaturalistic\u201D habitats. Complex environments such as these have been found to affect the behavior of captive animals favorably, including increasing reproductive and rearing success, encouraging the expression of species\u2010typical behavior patterns, and decreasing abnormal behaviors. In June 1988, Zoo Atlanta completed four naturalistic habitats for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). These new habitats afforded a unique opportunity to study the adaptation of lowland gorillas to novel, naturalistic habitats. During the first year of habitation, a total of 451 hours of data were collected on 11 gorillas housed in three harem groups. Focal animal sampling with a behavioral change scoring system was used to obtain information on behavior, substrate, environmental components utilized, and location in sun or shade. Instantaneous scans at 15 minute intervals provided information on location and behavior of all individuals. Adaptation to the environments was assessed by using the indices of: time spent manipulating objects across the course of the study, the percent of the habitats utilized, and the dispersal of individual animals over the habitats. Trends in these behaviors indicated that exploration of the environments significantly decreased, but that this decline in exploration took over six months to occur. Several interpretations of these findings are presented including the unfamiliarity of these naturalistic habitats to these subjects.","publish_time":"2005-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogden, Jacqueline J.; Finlay, Ted W.; Maple, Terry L.","journal":"Zoo Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1de0d3fd5827a13dec6ba1bd96a85a361d42561.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Zoo Atlanta"],"keyphrases":["naturalistic habitats","new habitats","Gorilla gorilla gorilla","behavior of captive animals","Complex environments","adaptation of lowland gorillas","typical behavior patterns","effects of captive environments","western lowland gorillas","information","location","exploration","study","abnormal behaviors","dispersal of individual animals","behavioral change scoring system","expression of species","minute intervals","Focal animal sampling","novel","rearing success","environmental components","unique opportunity","revolution","total","objects","course","investigations","substrate","Instantaneous scans","Zoo Atlanta","philosophy","design","time","hours of data","indices","percent","unfamiliarity","proliferation","zoological gardens","year of habitation","findings","decades","decline","months","harem groups","Trends","individuals","subjects","interpretations","past","shade"],"language":"en"},

We summarize and update here a worldwide survey of serum and plasma from cheetah and other nondomestic felids for antibodies to FIV and FIPV, based on Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. FIPV exposure shows an acute pattern with recognizable outbreaks in several zoological facilities, but is virtually nonexistent in sampled free\u2010ranging populations of cheetahs.

Because of the parallels with a high incidence of simian immunodeficiency virus in free\u2010ranging African primates without disease, the cat model may also reflect historic infections that have approached an evolutionary balance between the pathogen and immune defenses of their feline host species.

This paper summarizes the results of an infectious disease surveillance program, initially designed to monitor the infectious agents associated with clinically normal and clinically ill cheetahs in captivity, but subsequently supplemented with data from free\u2010living cheetahs. The focus was on two viral infections, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and feline rhinotracheitis virus. Results indicated that between 1989 and 1991, there was an increase in the seroprevalence (number antibody\u2010positive animals) of cheetahs to feline coronavirus from 41% to 64% in captivity. During this same time period, there were only two documented cases of FIP in cheetahs in the United States. The results suggest that feline coronavirus (feline enteric coronavirus\u2010\u2010feline infectious peritonitis group) or a closely related coronavirus of cheetahs is becoming endemic in the captive cheetah population. Further serologic results from 39 free\u2010living cheetahs demonstrated that there was a high seroprevalence (61%) to feline coronavirus, although serum antibody titers were considerably lower than those encountered in captive cheetahs. The observation of a high percentage of free\u2010living cheetahs, which were seropositive to feline herpesvirus (44%), was unexpected, since it has been generally regarded that this infection is primarily associated with cheetahs in captivity. \u00A9 1993 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2005-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evermann, James F.; Laurenson, M.

Analyses are based on the case of South Korea\u0027s response to the 2015 outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Based on a survey of governmental organizations, the study indicates that governmental agencies seek either reciprocal or redundant communication ties with other governmental agencies while they aim to secure crucial information from high\u2010level organizations to tackle the transboundary nature of the infectious disease during the outbreak response. Semi\u2010structured interviews with South Korean officials confirm that subnational governmental agencies rely on the national government and also seek information from other regional and local agencies to improve the resilience in interagency risk communication and to prevent the further transmission of the infectious disease in their local jurisdictions. This study empirically demonstrates how governmental agencies cope with the uncertainty of infectious disease transmission by expanding risk communication channels when hierarchical communication channels and information systems do not meet the needs of outbreak response. The research findings contribute to the understanding of the interactions across organizations in addressing the needs of public health crises that are transboundary in nature and provide important lessons for outbreak responses in South Korea as well as in other countries.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, KyungWoo; Yoon, Ho Young; Jung, Kyujin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f130bce2d22ea18652103d1bc4ab1f18e6b6fc6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["subnational governmental agencies","local agencies","local governmental agencies resilience","survey of governmental organizations","risk communication channels","use of risk communication","interagency risk communication","needs of outbreak response","study","hierarchical communication channels","outbreak responses","redundant communication ties","uncertainty of infectious disease transmission","transboundary nature","information systems","high\u2010level organizations","crucial information","case of South Korea\u0027s response","local jurisdictions","South Korean officials","needs of public health crises","important lessons","Semi\u2010structured interviews","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","understanding","interactions","research findings","Analyses","countries"],"language":"en"},

There is a paucity of in\u2010depth qualitative research into the general public\u0027s understanding of, and reactions to, such potential health crises. Four focus groups were conducted in April 2006 and a further eight focus groups in July 2006, to examine people\u0027s knowledge, beliefs and behaviours in relation to avian influenza, with the primary aim being to inform the development of future communication strategies. It was clear from the focus groups that avian influenza is not a disease the participants perceive they are likely to acquire; it was not simply that Australia was far from mind when thinking of avian influenza, but that they also saw Australia as a haven protected from avian influenza. We found that, in general, participants see avian influenza as yet another example of media sensationalism\u2014not as a disease that poses any real risk to Australia\u2014and are clearly unprepared for a potential outbreak. Governments and health authorities should conduct further research to understand consumer perceptions of avian (or other pandemic) influenza, and attitudes towards the recommended protective behaviours, in order to pro\u2010actively develop communication strategies to rapidly inform the public and encourage appropriate behavioural responses in the event that the potential risk is realised.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) act as adjuvants when coadministered with peptide antigens or given as fusion proteins. However, there is a potential risk of autoimmunity when using the complete molecules, because HSPs are evolutionary conserved. To overcome this, we first evaluated the adjuvant effect against two different antigens of a less\u2010conserved fraction of Plasmodium falciparum HSP70 (Pf70C) and compared it to the whole HSP70 molecule from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcHSP70). We found that Pf70C exhibited similar adjuvant properties as the whole molecule. We later evaluated the adjuvant potential of Pf70C against the malarial antigen EB200 in a chimeric DNA construct. No appreciable levels of EB200\u2010specific antibodies were detected in mice immunized only with the DNA constructs. However, DNA primed the immune system, because subsequent challenge with the corresponding recombinant fusion proteins elicited a strong Th\u20101 antibody response. In contrast, no priming effect was observed for ex vivo IFN\u2010\u03B3 production but stimulation with the HSP\u2010chimeric fusion protein induced a stronger secretion of IFN\u2010\u03B3in vitro than other proteins used. These results indicate that the use of HSPs is promising in the design of new vaccines.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahman, Q.

Unfortunately, bioavailability varies with IFN species and mode of administration, and all IFN species are potentially immunogenic. Assays for antiviral activity (IFN) and antiviral neutralization (antibodies, NAb) have been used for some time to monitor patients on IFN biologicals. These assays require laborious titrations making them unsuitable for large\u2010scale clinical use. Our laboratories have therefore modified the antiviral assays for IFN bioactivity and Nab, so that they are suitable for large\u2010scale screening in specialized laboratories. The read\u2010out is survival of a subcloned A549 cell line in the presence of an otherwise lethal amount of virus. Thus, survival increases in the presence of type 1 IFN and decreases in the presence of NAb against the IFN added to the cells. MxA is induced by type 1 IFN and can be used for measuring the Nab activity. In another assay, the MxA level in the A549 cell line is measured. In an attempt to find a new and better reporter gene for type 1 IFN than MxA and genes specific for either IFN\u2010\u03B1 or \u2010\u03B2, a micro array screen was carried using the U133A chip from Affymetrix. The expression of 22,000 genes can be studied simultaneous with this technology. The results will be presented at the conference.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00F8nder, S. U.

In this study, we first demonstrate that both the presence and the activation state of these MSC depends on tumour evolution. While in tumour regressors hardly any arginase\u2010producing MSC can be found, both the amount and the arginase activity of this population expands from early over late progressors. This gradual induction of MSCs is paralleled by an increasing suppression of CTL activity and Th1, but not Th2, cytokine production. Upon analysing the molecular repertoire of MSC in vitro, we found, besides arginase1, a well\u2010established marker for alternatively activated myeloid cells or M2, a strong upregulation of FIZZ1 and Ym, two additional recently identified markers for M2. Further evaluation of molecular markers by microarray analysis in MSC yielded genes involved in wound healing (e.g. coagulation factor XIIIa), anti\u2010inflammation (e.g. selenoprotein P), immunomodulation (e.g. PD\u2010L2) and fat and sugar metabolism (e.g. leptin receptor). Of note, many of these genes are regulated by type 2 cytokines (IL\u20104, IL\u201013 and IL\u201010) and are therefore rather M2 associated.

A chip can be printed with thousands of protein probes (e.g. antibodies), the biological sample added (e.g. a proteome) and any binding detected. We aim to develop protein microarrays based on human recombinant scFv antibody fragments for global proteome analysis. The concept of comparing proteomic maps of healthy versus diseased samples will allow disease\u2010specific proteins to be detected. In fact, antibody microarrays will allow us to perform comparative proteome analysis on any sample format in a species\u2010independent manner, as long as a proteome can be isolated. However, the complexity of proteomes, containing several thousands of different proteins, is a problem. Here, we have designed antibody microarrays targeting the water\u2010soluble fraction of a proteome. To this end, an anticytokine antibody array was developed and human dendritic cells (\u00B1activation) was used as model system. The results showed that our antibody microarrays could be used to examine the cytokine profile in complex samples. Furthermore, we have taken the first steps towards comparing our results with those of other technologies on both the protein and gene level. Due to the complexity of the model proteome, we also examined the possibility to prefractionate the proteome in a simple one\u2010step procedure (based on size) prior to the labelling step. In more detail, the sample proteome was fractionated into two fractions using membrane devices with different molecular weight cut\u2010offs. The results showed that the fractionation considerably enhanced the assay sensitivity allowing cytokines in the pg/ml range to be readily detectable.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ingvarsson, J.; Lindstedt, M.; Borrebaeck, C.

The discovery of a new serotype, with some properties distinct from MVM, highlights the importance of employing both genetic and serotype-specific tests for the identification of murine parvoviruses (MPVs). The detection of multiple MPVs isolates indicated a need for standardized nomenclature. As with other autonomous parvoviruses, MPVs require cellular factors expressed during cell division and differentiation for productive replication. These factors are thought to account for their predilection for mitotically active cells. The simple structure of rodent parvoviruses has stimulated development of valuable reagents to detect infection. These include generic and serotype-specific antigens for use in serological tests, antibodies to viral proteins for use in immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction primers for detection of viral DNA in infected tissues and feces, and strand-specific molecular probes that help distinguish sites of active viral replication. Because MVM does not persist in immunocompetent mice, control and elimination should employ quarantine for at least 1 month, combined with thorough disinfection of the environment. Quarantine also assumes that MPV infection is ruled out. Prevention is based on sound serological monitoring of mice and surveillance of biologicals destined for inoculation of mice.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"O.

Unlike other RNA viruses which make their structural proteins first, this class of proteins is synthesized after \u22121 PRF, from subgenomic mRNAs produced subsequent to production of RDRP. Also unique among the coronaviruses is the inclusion of mRNA structural elements that do not appear to be essential for frameshifting. Understanding the differences between \u20131 PRF signals from coronaviruses and other viruses will enhance our understanding of \u20131 PRF in general, and will be instructive in designing new classes of antiviral therapeutics.

A more effective and uniform approach to the prevention of these microbial threats is essential. The technological advances in the next generation sequencing field and decreasing costs of these tests provide novel opportunities in understanding the dynamics of infection\u2014even in real time\u2014through the analysis of microbial genome diversity. The projected significant increase in whole (microbial) genome sequencing (WGS) will likely also enable a much better understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and the molecular basis of the host response to infection. But the full potential of these advances will only transpire if the data in this area become transferable and thereby comparable, preferably in open-source systems. There is therefore an obvious need to develop a global system of whole microbial genome databases to aggregate, share, mine and use microbiological genomic data, to address global public health and clinical challenges, and most importantly to identify and diagnose infectious diseases. The global microbial identifier (GMI) initiative, aims to build a database of whole microbial genome sequencing data linked to relevant metadata, which can be used to identify microorganisms, their communities and the diseases they cause. It would be a platform for storing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of microorganisms, for the identification of relevant genes and for the comparison of genomes to detect outbreaks and emerging pathogens. To harness the full potential of WGS, a shared global database of genomes linked to relevant metadata and the necessary software tools needs to be generated, hence the global microbial identifier (GMI) initiative. This tool will ideally be used in amongst others in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in humans and animals, in the identification of microorganisms in food and environment, and to track and trace microbial agents in all arenas globally. This will require standardization and extensive investments in computational analytical tools. In addition, the wider introduction of WGS in clinical diagnostics can accelerate developments in health care in many poor countries. This overview describes the growing network of stakeholders behind GMI, the contours of the database, and the IT structures needed to serve the GMI user community. It discusses what essentially can be done by a global GMI tool and how the GMI organization could help achieve these goals.","publish_time":"2017-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wielinga, Peter R.; Hendriksen, Rene S.; Aarestrup, Frank M.; Lund, Ole; Smits, Saskia L.; Koopmans, Marion P.

ADRs can occur during treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) or result in ICU admissions. A meta-analysis of 4139 studies suggests the incidence of ADRs among hospitalized patients is 17% [2]. Because of underreporting and misdiagnosis, the incidence of ADRs may be much higher and has been reported to be as high as 36% [3]. Critically ill patients are at especially high risk because of medical complexity, numerous high-alert medications, complex and often challenging drug dosing and medication regimens, and opportunity for error related to the distractions of the ICU environment [4]. Table 1 summarizes the ADRs included in this chapter.","publish_time":"2017-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, Philip; Burkhart, Keith","journal":"Critical Care Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e9666b7af072ba6579cafa1bf7cacb85620e47c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of ADRs","high risk","ICU environment","ICU admissions","numerous high-alert medications","ill patients","hospitalized patients","undesirable effects of medications","challenging drug dosing","Adverse drug reactions","medical complexity","medication regimens","opportunity","error","distractions","intensive care unit","treatment","studies","normal doses","misdiagnosis","meta-analysis","underreporting","Table","chapter"],"language":"en"},

It examines how the film\u2019s protagonist gets caught up in logics of exclusion in his experience of becoming-alien and approaches a position of bare life, outside the protections of the community. Ultimately, the chapter concludes the project by arguing that new, creative modes of resisting neocolonial and capitalist violence will be needed in response to biopolitical regimes, and that such creativity might arise from different desires and other modes of affect.","publish_time":"2017-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Price, Jason D.","journal":"Animals and Desire in South African Fiction","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d73727591eb5ce9370ae0b3dc7b643e8e2e7b70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153451.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153451/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-human alien relationships","creative modes","modes of affect","final chapter","biopolitical regimes","overt biopolitical dimensions","Neill Blomkamp\u2019s film District","multinational security company","commentary","violent machinations","coda","capitalist violence","creativity","different desires","response","previous chapters","position of bare life","protections","logics of exclusion","experience","project","film\u2019s protagonist","issues","community"],"language":"en"},

It discusses the existing applications of monoclonal antibodies, including the use of pilus-specific monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization of calves and piglets against enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infections as well as the development of rapid diagnostic test kits for field diagnosis of EPEC infections. The potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against a variety of veterinary pathogens are passive immunization against Moraxella bovis (pinkeye), Bacteroides nodosus (foot rot), EPEC enterotoxin (enteric colibacillosis), Pasteurella haemolytica (pneumonic pasteurellosis), and Streptococcus equi (strangles). Three main areas of application for monoclonal antibodies against bacterial antigens in veterinary medicine are passive immunization, improved immunodiagnostics, and immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, because of their specificity, unlimited availability, and high titer, represent excellent passive immunizing agents. However, their potential usefulness in preventing infection must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"SHERMAN, DAVID M.; MARKHAM, R.J.F.","journal":"Monoclonal Antibodies Against Bacteria","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Moraxella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["EPEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific monoclonal antibodies","potential applications of monoclonal antibodies","future applications of monoclonal antibodies","existing applications of monoclonal antibodies","passive immunization of calves","veterinary medicine","excellent passive immunizing agents","EPEC enterotoxin","field diagnosis of EPEC infections","variety of veterinary pathogens","potential usefulness","case basis","bacterial antigens","high titer","pinkeye","Moraxella bovis","development of rapid diagnostic test kits","Bacteroides nodosus","enteric colibacillosis","foot rot","enteropathogenic","piglets","use of pilus","pneumonic pasteurellosis","Pasteurella haemolytica","improved immunodiagnostics","specificity","main areas of application","unlimited availability","Streptococcus equi","chapter","immunotherapy"],"language":"en"},

The enzymatic breakdown of kinins affects the duration of their biological actions as the plasma half-life of intravenously injected BK is in the range of seconds. Kinins are cleaved in vitro and in vivo by enzymes that belong to families, such as zinc-metallopeptidases, astacin-like metallopeptidases, and catheptic enzymes. Vane noted the importance of the pulmonary circulation in the metabolism of vasoactive substances, such as BK as well as angiotensin 1 and 5- hydroxytryptamine. It is clear after decades of research that angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) on the vascular endothelial cell surface is the most important inactivator of blood-borne BK. BK may act primarily in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, establishing the importance of local regulation of its activity by enzymes on cell surfaces. Thus, the assortment of other enzymes that can inactivate BK is important in a variety of physiological and pathological situations. Most physiological systems have redundant pathways of metabolism so that the abolishment of one pathway is compensated for by the presence of others. This is demonstrated by the pharmacological inhibition of ACE in hypertension.","publish_time":"2007-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erd\u00F6s, Ervin G.; Skidgel, Randal A.","journal":"The Kinin System","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["injected BK","catheptic enzymes","metabolism of bradykinin","angiotensin","redundant pathways of metabolism","metabolism of vasoactive substances","variety of physiological","physiological systems","cell surfaces","zinc-metallopeptidases","importance of local regulation","important inactivator of blood","pharmacological inhibition of ACE","enzymatic breakdown of kinins","vascular endothelial cell surface","activity","duration","plasma half-life","pulmonary circulation","biological actions","astacin","decades of research","paracrine fashion","hypertension","pathological situations","overview","abolishment","health","families","range of seconds","disease","Vane","chapter","presence","hydroxytryptamine","assortment"],"language":"en"},

It is about explaining the importance of work to grant panels, funding agencies, and project reviewers; publishing research; and informing and educating the public. It is also involved in building relationships, bringing and keeping teams together, and becoming recognized. This chapter highlights the essentials of communication. The ability to communicate effectively is not an innate quality that one either does or does not possess. It is a set of skills that can be learned and developed, regardless of one\u0027s starting point. While some people seem more naturally adept than others, through conscious effort, practice, and constructive feedback, everyone can improve. Being able to speak knowledgeably and fluently is important for effective communication, especially at the beginning of any conversation or presentation because it sets the tone, and can positively influence self-confidence. An important strategy for increasing preparedness and effectiveness as a communicator is to commit to the continual development of skills. Another way to influence how to communicate successfully is to understand the audience\u2014the \u201Creceivers\u201D of the message\u2014and to use the information to make the best \u201Cconnection.\u201D","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szymanski, Christine","journal":"Success Strategies for Women in Science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective communication","essentials of communication","important strategy","set of skills","continual development of skills","project reviewers","funding agencies","panels","increasing preparedness","effectiveness","conscious effort","practice","communicator","beginning","constructive feedback","publishing research","teams","information","presentation","importance of work","life","receivers","tone","message","building relationships","best","connection","science","conversation","chapter","innate quality","starting point","audience","self-confidence","people","way","public","ability"],"language":"en"},

Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box\u2013Behnken design was applied to determine optimal conditions. The following optimized UMAE processing parameters were obtained: sonication time (96.13 s), microwave power (305.28 W), and solid/solvent ratio (1:37). Based on a total phenolic compound extraction yield of 9.21 mg gallic acid (GA) equ/g dry weight (DW), a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.52 \u03BCg GA equ, and an antioxidant capacity detected by 2,2\u2032-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay of 8.79 mg trolox equ/g DW. The optimized UMAE extract was superior to those obtained using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) or conventional solvent extraction (CSE) methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the three extraction methods affected the sample tissue microstructure. Among them, UMAE caused the most marked structural disruption. UPLC-PDA-Q-TOF-MS analysis identified 67 phenolic compounds in the optimized UMAE extract of the Foshou fruit extract. This study indicated that the integrated UMAE technique is a suitable and safe technique to enhance the qualitative and quantitative extraction of phenolic compounds from Foshou fruit. These phenolic compounds can be used as a functional food ingredient in industrial production.

This model distinguishes between the use of digital communication tools for diagnostic, risk communication, and coordination activities and highlights how the influx of novel actors and tendencies towards digital and operational convergence risks focusing humanitarian action and decision-making outside national authorities\u2019 spheres of influence in pandemic response. This risk exacerbates a fundamental tension between the humanitarian promise of new technologies and the fundamental norm that international humanitarian response should complement and give primacy to the role of national authorities when possible.

Both top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The situation has changed since 2009 because of China\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s second largest economy. With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese government\u2019s support for discursive power, the dominant explanation is based on the \u201Crise of China\u201D argument. However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between China\u2019s rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind China\u2019s discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since China\u2019s adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the established political order.","publish_time":"2016-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Kejin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc31883f9c4939073e4152660fb334971a481961.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Communist Party"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China\u2019s discursive power strategy","China\u2019s rise","China\u2019s rapid rise","Communist Party of China","China\u2019s adoption","international affairs","leaders","argument","new political model","new discourse","foreign policy","fundamental principle","domestic affairs","established political order","various international occasions","document reviews","advocating","interviews","attention","Chinese government\u2019s support","mere follower","world\u2019s","causal relationship","motivations","mainstream scholars","government agencies","dominant explanation","century","debate","establishment","opening","world stage","largest economy","regard","paper","tradition","situation"],"language":"en"},

It is listed as \u201CLeast Concern\u201D by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, is on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and its population size trend is considered stable. However, the status of United States subpopulations, being largely peripheral to the Canadian population, is more tenuous and the species is protected.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavoie, Maxime; Renard, Aur\u00E9lie; Larivi\u00E8re, Serge","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bba5ebcd2081b96219ea63aa100fdf5e4262bba1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada","Alaska","United States"],"keyphrases":["Canada lynx","Lynx canadensis Kerr","genus Lynx","population size trend","northern United States","International Trade","International Union","Endangered Species of Wild Fauna","Canadian population","status of United States subpopulations","medium size felid","Flora","coniferous forests","moderate canopy","ecology","Conservation of Nature","Convention","portions","Natural Resources","understory cover","snowshoe hare specialist","Alaska","Appendix","behavior","morphology","boreal forest","Concern","main prey"],"language":"en"},

Much of the knowledge on pathologic conditions of pinnipeds comes from necropsies of stranded animals and those housed in captivity. As such, disease knowledge is biased toward species frequently housed in zoos and aquaria, those that strand more commonly, or those in which free-ranging populations are more easily accessible. Though historically systematic evaluations of wild populations have rarely been accomplished, in the past 10 years, with advances in marine mammal medicine and anesthesia, biologists and veterinarians more frequently completed live animal health field investigations to evaluate health and disease in free-ranging pinniped populations.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colegrove, Kathleen M.; Burek-Huntington, Kathy A.; Roe, Wendi; Siebert, Ursula","journal":"Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species","disease knowledge","pinniped populations","true seals","fur seals","systematic evaluations of wild populations","pathologic conditions of pinnipeds","live animal health field investigations","chapter reviews common diseases of pinnipeds","sea lions","advances","marine mammal medicine","anesthesia","biologists","veterinarians","Otariidae","Phocidae","necropsies of stranded animals","years","Odobenidae","walrus","families","captivity","zoos","aquaria"],"language":"en"},

The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time. Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification. This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet. In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk. To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures). This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide. It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, Catharine M; Fishman, Douglas S; Lerner, Diana G","journal":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric procedures","Pediatric endoscopic procedures","stratifying procedures","Procedures Committee","pediatric patients","Pediatric Gastroenterology","transmission","control of COVID","delivery of endoscopic care","staff","endoscopy services","aim of minimizing COVID","endoscopy facilities","high risk","Appropriate use of PPE","benefits","statement","risks","patient risk stratification","face shield","healthcare delivery","filtering face-piece respirator","droplet precautions","jurisdiction","public health agencies","N95","Hepatology","current recommendations","Nutrition","body water-resistant disposable gown","infection prevention","shoe","visor","contact","caregivers","negative pressure room","NASPGHAN","North American Society","double gloves","facial protection","personal protective equipment","PAPR","FFP2","N99","framework","practical guidance","era of Coronavirus Disease","PAUSE","emerging evidence","critical time","hairnet","supply","guide","decisions","elective"],"language":"en"},

Patients not receiving care due to closure of outpatient services suffer a collateral damage. Our aim was to provide first data on impact of Covid-19 on people experiencing disability in Europe. METHODS We developed an estimation from a survey and publicly available data. Thirty-eight countries have been inquired through the European Bodies of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine - the rehabilitation medical specialty. The 9-questions focused on March 31st, 2020. We used the following indicators: for inpatients, acute and rehabilitative hospital beds; for outpatients, missing uniform European data, we used information from Italy, Belgium and UK, and estimated for Europe basing on population, number of rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, and people with self-reported limitations. FINDINGS Thirty-five countries (92%) including 99% of the population (809.9 million) answered. Stop of admissions to rehabilitation, early discharge and reduction of activities involved 194,800 inpatients in 10 countries. Outpatient activities stopped for 87%, involving 318,000 patients per day in Italy, Belgium and UK, leading to an estimate range of 1,3-2,2 million in Europe. Seven countries reported experiences on rehabilitation for acute Covid-19 patients. INTERPRETATION Covid-19 emergency is having a huge impact on rehabilitation of people experiencing disability. This may lead to future cumulative effects due to reduced functional outcome and consequent increased burden of care. When the emergency will fade, rehabilitation demand will probably grow due to an expected return wave of these not well treated patients, but probably also of post-Covid-19 patients\u0027 needs.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negrini, Stefano; Grabljevec, Klemen; Boldrini, Paolo; Kiekens, Carlotte; Moslavac, Sasa; Zampolini, Mauro; Christodoulou, Nicolas","journal":"European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.20.06361-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Europe","Belgium"],"keyphrases":["rehabilitation of people","Rehabilitation Medicine","rehabilitation demand","impact of Covid","countries","acute Covid","number of rehabilitation physicians","rehabilitation medical specialty","post-Covid","INTERPRETATION Covid","treated patients","UK","inpatients","uniform European data","great impact","Italy","huge impact","Belgium","available data","Outpatient activities","emergency","disability","Europe basing","population","closure of outpatient services","health services","reduction of activities","European Bodies of Physical","self-reported limitations","consequent increased burden of care","functional outcome","outpatients","physiotherapists","information","rehabilitative hospital beds","early discharge","pandemic","day","future cumulative effects","experiences","collateral damage","estimation","expected return wave","survey","following indicators","patients\u0027 needs","admissions","estimate range","BACKGROUND","METHODS","aim","FINDINGS","questions"],"language":"en"},

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system in differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia on chest CT and assess radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Methods 521 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from ten hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia on chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by two-layer fully-connected neural network to pool slices together. Our final cohort of 1,186 patients (132,583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance on separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results Our final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% CI: 90-98%), sensitivity 95% (95% CI: 83-100%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88-99%) with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC of 0.95 and Precision-Recall (PR) AUC of 0.90.

We aim to present our results of video-endoscopic tension-free repair of groin hernias via the total extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. Methods Between September 2016 and December 2018, 124 patients with groin hernias underwent tension-free repair using prolene mesh by video-endoscopic surgery via the TEP approach. This is a retrospective analysis of 110 (88.7%) male and 14 (11.3%) female patients with a mean age of 48.1 years. Groin hernia types, locations of hernias, intraoperative and postoperative complications, results of the mean 24-month follow-up, and recurrence rate were reported. Results A total of 134 hernias were repaired in 124 patients who had 53 (42.7%) right, 61 (49.2%) left, and 10 (8.1%) bilateral groin hernias. The most common hernia type was an indirect inguinal hernia in 83/134 (62%) groin hernias. A total of 119 (88.8%) and 15 (11.2%) hernias were primary and recurrent, respectively. Seroma was detected in two (1.6%) patients in the early postoperative period. The mean duration of hospital stay was 1.4 (1-3) days. During the follow-up period, hernia recurrence was determined in three (2.4%) patients. Hernia recurrence was detected among patients who were operated on during the first half of the study. Conclusion Tension-free repair of groin hernias by video-endoscopic technique via the TEP approach can be performed with very low complication and recurrence rates. The success of the TEP approach increases parallel to increasing surgical experience. The results of hernia repair via the TEP approach are highly satisfactory and encouraging, especially when attention is paid to proper patient selection during the learning curve period.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dogan, Sami; Gurleyik, Emin","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.6839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32175206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Seroma"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bilateral groin hernias","endoscopic tension-free repair of groin hernias","Introduction Tension-free repair of groin hernias","Conclusion Tension-free repair of groin hernias","locations of hernias","results of hernia repair","TEP approach","hernia recurrence","Groin hernia types","results of video","video-endoscopic surgery","female patients","video-endoscopic technique","indirect inguinal hernia","common hernia type","follow-up period","recurrence rates","mean age","early postoperative period","total extraperitoneal","learning curve period","postoperative complications","month follow-up","mean duration of hospital stay","synthetic material","prolene mesh","proper patient selection","accepted method","attention","low complication","surgical experience","success","various approaches","years","retrospective analysis","half","study","Methods","right","Seroma","days"],"language":"en"},

Our study aimed to synthesise extant literature regarding the combined psychological responses and coping methods used by the general population in past outbreaks. METHODS We conducted a narrative synthesis of the published literature over the last two decades with a quality appraisal of included articles that reported both psychological responses and coping strategies within infectious disease outbreaks. RESULTS A total of 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and loss, post-traumatic stress, and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support, avoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. CONCLUSION Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus on the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self- care, empowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chew, Qian Hui; Wei, Ker Chiah; Vasoo, Shawn; Chua, Hong Choon; Sim, Kang","journal":"Singapore medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combined psychological responses","range of psychosocial responses","past infectious disease outbreaks","psychological help","range of possible psychosocial responses","psychological impact","general population","past outbreaks","coping strategies","coping methods","studies","included problem-focused coping","present coronavirus disease","quality appraisal of included articles","self- care","current COVID","extant literature","social support","positive appraisal","published literature","Ebola epidemic","pandemic need","H1N1 outbreak","larger social environment","severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic","access","empowering self-support groups","sustained engagement","grief","anxiety","practical considerations","loss","guilt","anger","depression","fears","post-traumatic stress","stigmatisation","reliable information","emphasis","decades","alternatives","context","individual","avoidance","narrative synthesis","preservation","awareness","Common themes","well-being","greater sense of empowerment","compassion","survivors","caregivers","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION","papers","situation","study","total"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, the heterogeneity and diversity of microbial communities, compounded with the large size of the datasets, impose a tremendous challenge to mechanistically elucidate the complex communities. Fortunately, network analyses provide an efficient way to tackle this problem, and several network approaches have been proposed to improve this understanding recently. Here, we systemically illustrate these network theories that have been used in biological and biomedical research.

METHODS The sample included 41 children and adolescents with obesity participating in a longitudinal observational study located in Verona, Italy. Lifestyle information including diet, activity, and sleep behaviors were collected at baseline and three weeks into the national lockdown during which home confinement was mandatory. Changes in outcomes over the two study time points were evaluated for significance using paired t-tests. RESULTS There were no changes in reported vegetable intake; fruit intake increased (p=0.055) during the lockdown. By contrast, potato chip, red meat, and sugary drink intakes increased significantly during the lockdown (p-value range, 0.005 to \u003C0.001).

Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbeek, Jos H; Rajamaki, Blair; Ijaz, Sharea; Sauni, Riitta; Toomey, Elaine; Blackwood, Bronagh; Tikka, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293717/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","HCW","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["doffing PPE","body PPE","types of PPE","standard PPE","PPE design","PPE protocols","type of PPE","Modified PPE","adapted PPE","risk of contamination","RR","simulation studies","controlled studies","selected studies","risk of bias","risk ratio","greater risk of infection","MD","doffing processes","doffing of masks","median contamination rates","better fitting gown","low-certainty evidence","sealed gown","long gown","method of donning","types of training","low certainty","training methods","effects of training","better cover","gown-wrist interface","exposed body parts","effect of various ways of donning","small patches","infectious diseases","quasi-RCT","controlled trials","outcomes","participants","patients\u0027 contaminated body fluids","non-randomised design","review authors","Disease Control","DATA COLLECTION","water-repellent material","SEARCH METHODS","breathable material","control groups","best way","greater user satisfaction","random-effects meta-analyses","SARS","glove combination","following modifications","contact","Ebola","fluorescent markers","Prevention","ANALYSIS","neck","severe acute respiratory syndrome","simulated exposure","N95 mask","MEDLINE","CDC","mean difference","aprons","wrists","trunk","Centers","harmless microbes","general population","similar number of spots","COVID","MAIN RESULTS Earlier versions","air","recommendations","people","hands","guidance","indirectness","confidence interval","Embase","CINAHL","coronavirus","healthcare workers","BACKGROUND","epidemics","Personal protective equipment","SELECTION CRITERIA","noncompliance","tabs","non-compliance","gloves","intervention","coveralls","OBJECTIVES","Gowns","update","HCWs","scale","bacterial contamination","fluorescent contamination","similar contamination","doffing procedures","fewer contamination spots","donning PPE","PPE use","use of PPE","CDC doffing guidance","combinations of PPE","fewer errors","Face-to-face training","breathable types of PPE","gown removal","Double-gloving","RCTs of training","One-step removal of gloves","folder-based training","use of additional computer simulation","one-step glove","single gloving","simulation of exposure","difficult donning","Face-to-face instruction","Additional spoken instruction","separate removal","HCW","glove disinfection","better protection","user comfort","video lecture","real-life evidence","traditional lecture","risk of infection","better skills scores","Extra sanitation of gloves","alcohol-based hand rub","quaternary ammonium","odds ratio","parts","instructions","assessment of outcome","body","cost","Consensus","long-term follow-up","bleach","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","Modifications","folders","videos"],"language":"en"},

Because of this, the use of different terms and concepts to explain the same phenomena and lack of standardization in reporting interventions often leaves a gap that hinders knowledge accumulation. Interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies are a cross-disciplinary area potentially affected by this gap. A review of the underlying frameworks, models, and theories that have informed projects at this crossroad could advance future research and development efforts. OBJECTIVE This research aimed to identify and compare underlying approaches that have informed interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies. The objective was to achieve an understanding of the distinct approaches by highlighting common or conflicting principles, guidelines, and methods. METHODS The metaethnography approach was used to review and synthesize researchers\u0027 reports on how they applied frameworks, models, and theories in their projects. Literature was systematically searched in 7 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Included studies were thoroughly read and coded to extract data for the synthesis. Studies were mainly related by the key ingredients of the underlying approaches they applied. The key ingredients were finally translated across studies and synthesized into thematic clusters. RESULTS Of 1224 initial results, 17 articles were included. The articles described research and development of 10 different projects. Frameworks, models, and theories (n=43) applied by the projects were identified. Key ingredients (n=293) of the included articles were mapped to the following themes of eHealth development: (1) it is a participatory process; (2) it creates new infrastructures for improving health care, health, and well-being; (3) it is intertwined with implementation; (4) it integrates theory, evidence, and participatory approaches for persuasive design; (5) it requires continuous evaluation cycles; (6) it targets behavior change; (7) it targets technology adoption; and (8) it targets health-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review support and exemplify the numerous possibilities in the use of frameworks, models, and theories to guide research and development of eHealth. Participatory, user-centered design, and integration with empirical evidence and theoretical modeling were widely identified principles in the literature. On the contrary, less attention has been given to the integration of implementation in the development process and supporting novel eHealth-based health care infrastructures. To better integrate theory and evidence, holistic approaches can combine patient-centered studies with consolidated knowledge from expert-based approaches.

Approaches to evidence synthesis such as carefully conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools to summarize specific topics. Unfortunately, not all systematic reviews are truly systematic, and their quality can vary substantially. Since well-conducted evidence synthesis typically involves a complex set of steps, we believe formulating a cohesive, step-by-step guide on how to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis is essential. While most of the guidelines on systematic reviews focus on how to report or appraise systematic reviews, they lack guidance on how to synthesize evidence efficiently. To facilitate the design and development of evidence syntheses, we provide a clear and concise, 24-step guide on how to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and clinical trials. We describe each step, illustrate it with concrete examples, and provide relevant references for further guidance. The 24-step guide (1) simplifies the methodology of conducting a systematic review, (2) provides healthcare professionals and researchers with methodologically sound tools for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and (3) it can enhance the quality of existing evidence synthesis efforts. This guide will help its readers to better understand the complexity of the process, appraise the quality of published systematic reviews, and better comprehend (and use) evidence from medical literature.","publish_time":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muka, Taulant; Glisic, Marija; Milic, Jelena; Verhoog, Sanne; Bohlius, Julia; Bramer, Wichor; Chowdhury, Rajiv; Franco, Oscar H","journal":"European journal of epidemiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-019-00576-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31720912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of published systematic reviews","available evidence","well-conducted evidence synthesis","evidence-based practice","development of evidence syntheses","quality of existing evidence synthesis efforts","meta-analyses","step-by-step guide","essential tools","meta-analysis of observational studies","guidelines","systemic review","guidance","sound tools","health care","policies","accurate identification","collation","integration","clinical trials","relevant references","researchers","healthcare professionals","concrete examples","complex set of steps","specific topics","time-efficient manner","process","use","medical literature","design","methodology","complexity","readers","Approaches"],"language":"en"},

This systematic review synthesizes the current evidence about the QoL of individuals with EB. METHODS We included observational studies with people of all age groups, both sexes, and any EB type. Studies with qualitative methodology, chapters of books, meeting proceedings, and abstracts were excluded. RESULTS In this study, 12 articles comprising 745 individuals were included. More than half of the articles observed lower QoL in individuals with recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) or junctional EB (JEB). Three articles indicated that EB affected QoL more in women than in men, and one article identified that children with EB suffered more than adults with the disease. Pain was frequently reported. Seven articles identified difficulty in sports, two identified a need for bathing assistance, and three identified eating difficulties. Additionally, participants reported that family relationships and friendships were affected, and they experienced feelings of anxiety and depression. Some of the instruments used evaluated QoL in general dermatologic conditions, and one was specific to EB. CONCLUSION QoL is more affected in people who have RDEB and JEB. Regarding sex and age, women and children need special care in their monitoring. It is necessary that guidelines on pain management be more disseminated and put into practice. Future studies should use standardized specific instruments to assess the QoL in EB individuals, while considering the particularities of the different age groups.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Togo, C C G; Zidorio, A P C; Gon\u00E7alves, V S S; Hubbard, L; de Carvalho, K M B; Dutra, E S","journal":"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02495-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EB","RDEB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EB individuals","QoL of individuals","junctional EB","EB type","lower QoL","evaluated QoL","CONCLUSION QoL","articles","recessive dystrophic EB","PURPOSE Individuals","different age groups","people","RDEB","children","Future studies","observational studies","women","JEB","identified eating difficulties","need","standardized specific instruments","pain management","various clinical manifestations of different severities","present","chapters of books","epidermolysis bullosa","general dermatologic conditions","current evidence","particularities","meeting proceedings","qualitative methodology","special care","bathing assistance","quality of life","guidelines","sexes","participants","family relationships","friendships","abstracts","systematic review","monitoring","METHODS","sports","adults","study","half","feelings of anxiety","depression","difficulty","RESULTS","disease","practice"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies. DATA SOURCES We searched six bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts), with no limits on publication date. Eligible studies reported peer-reviewed qualitative research on experiences of aging in place in the United States with full-text available in English. REVIEW METHODS Three reviewers independently used Covidence software to screen titles and abstracts followed by full texts. We assessed quality and risk of bias using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Qualitative Research. Qualitative data analysis was conducted using meta-ethnography, following Noblit and Hare\u0027s seven-step method of translation and synthesis to generate a novel conceptual model. RESULTS Of 2659 papers screened, 37 unique studies were eligible for inclusion, reported in 38 publications. The studies were conducted in 16 states and published between 1994 and 2018. The included samples represented 1199 participants in total, with mean ages ranging from 48 to 91 years. The gender of the samples ranged from 20% to 100% female, with a median of 77%. One-third of the included studies did not report participants\u0027 race/ethnicity, and half of the remaining study samples were at least 90% white; however, 20% of the studies focused exclusively on experiences of racial/ethnic minority older adults. Using meta-ethnography, we developed a new conceptual model of aging in place in the United States as a dynamic process of balancing threats and agency in relation to experiences of identity, connectedness, and place. We found that people aging in place were engaged in significant work to cope with unpredictable needs and challenges by changing their mindset, adapting their home environment to accommodate new needs, and finding different ways to connect with important people in their lives. Agency was shaped by resources and restrictions on choice, and where threats to aging in place outweighed an individual\u0027s sense of agency, the consequences included feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and dislocation. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of qualitative studies to evaluate experiences of aging in place in the United States. The findings of our meta-ethnographic synthesis led to the development of a new conceptual model of aging in place highlighting the dynamic tensions involved in balancing threats and agency.","publish_time":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenwohl-Mack, Amy; Schumacher, Karen; Fang, Min-Lin; Fukuoka, Yoshimi","journal":"International journal of nursing studies","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.103496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hare"],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["place","experiences of aging","included studies","meta-ethnography of qualitative studies","systematic review of qualitative studies","United States","Eligible studies","new conceptual model of aging","unique studies","qualitative research","experiences of racial","experiences of identity","included samples","Qualitative data analysis","DESIGN Systematic review","new needs","REVIEW METHODS","meta-ethnographic synthesis","novel conceptual model","dynamic process of balancing threats","individual\u0027s sense of agency","remaining study samples","dynamic tensions","unpredictable needs","Sociological Abstracts","DATA SOURCES","important people","Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist","modified version","CINAHL","Embase","PsycINFO","half","consequences","Hare\u0027s","relation","development","bibliographic databases","Web of Science","Covidence software","PubMed","step method of translation","total","Noblit","different ways","participants\u0027 race","ethnic minority older adults","peer","evidence","isolation","risk of bias","ethnicity","limits","feelings of uncertainty","mindset","titles","reviewers","home environment","inclusion","restrictions","significant work","text available","connectedness","mean ages","challenges","knowledge","choice","resources","papers","findings","OBJECTIVES","purpose","CONCLUSIONS","best","publication date","dislocation","quality","English","lives","texts","female","median","RESULTS","years","publications","gender"],"language":"en"},

Synthetic chemical production, however, is a multi-billion-dollar industry that lacks appropriate international regulation to protect those exposed to toxic chemicals. This paper aims to describe the country-level import and export of key groups of synthetic chemicals using data from the United Nations Comtrade Database and provide a narrative review of the evidence from January 2018 to August 2019 on exposure to, health effects of, and interventions to reduce synthetic chemicals in vulnerable populations around the world. RECENT FINDINGS Generally, a small number of high-income countries export the majority of synthetic chemicals, while most low-income countries import more chemicals than they export, which may contribute to higher levels of synthetic chemicals in those settings. However, few studies have quantified exposures to synthetic chemicals in low- and middle-income countries, the health effects of such exposures, or interventions to mitigate exposures. Synthetic chemicals continue to enter markets despite our limited knowledge of their effects on human health, particularly in the most vulnerable populations. We need more research to understand the health impacts of these pervasive exposures.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodman, Dina; Arisco, Nicholas; Jaacks, Lindsay M","journal":"Current environmental health reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-020-00261-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32006347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations Comtrade Database"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["majority of synthetic chemicals","toxic chemicals","higher levels of synthetic chemicals","export of key groups of synthetic chemicals","health effects","toxic exposures","vulnerable populations","Synthetic chemical production","pervasive exposures","human health","health impacts","middle-income countries","low-income countries","research","interventions","small number of high-income countries","narrative review","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","country-level import","United Nations Comtrade Database","dollar industry","limited knowledge","appropriate international regulation","markets","air pollution","RECENT FINDINGS","settings","world","studies","evidence","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, the energy efficiency of BWED cannot approach optimization because of the low salt concentration of BW. In this study, a novel two hydraulic-stage ED desalination system was presented to enhance mass transfer and reduce energy consumption. In terms of energy-efficient strategies, it involved not only innovative membrane stack configurations (resin-filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pairs design) but also optimizing inflow modes (electrolytes parallel flow and dilute/concentrate counter flow). Results showed that thin resin-filled (1 mm) electrode cells, asymmetric cell pair design (cell pairs ratio of 1st and 2nd-hydraulic stages, 1.2), and optimizations of general inflow mode were beneficial for savings 10-30% of energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio (SR). The synergistic effects of these strategies indicated that this novel ED system could save \u223C40% of the energy consumption at the same SR, compared with conventional two hydraulic-stage ED system (CED). Three stage continuous BWED performance tests, compared with a CED, showed that a 36.9% total energy saving could be achieved using the novel ED system when the BW concentration decreased from 3500 mg/L to the quality requirement of drinking water (\u223C450 mg/L).

However, this strategy inevitably results in damage of normal brain tissue, causing severe complications, especially the late-delayed cognitive impairment. Due to the multifactorial and complex pathological effects of radiation, there is a lack of effective preventative and restorative treatments for the irradiated brain. Stem-cell therapy has held considerable promise for decades in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders because of its unique capacity for tissue repair and functional integrity. Currently, there is growing interest in using stem cells as a novel option to attenuate the adverse effects of irradiation. In the present review, we discuss recent studies evaluating stem-cell therapies for the irradiated brain and their therapeutic effects on ameliorating radiation-related brain injury as well as their potential challenges in clinical applications. We discuss these works in context of the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to CNS tissue in an attempt to elucidate the potential mechanisms of engrafted stem cells to reverse radiation-induced degenerative processes.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Chengyan; Gao, Yue; Lan, Xiaoyan; Lin, Jianwen; Thomas, Aline M; Li, Shen","journal":"Stem cell reviews and reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-09984-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["irradiated brain","Radiation therapy","pathogenesis of radiation","ameliorating radiation-related brain injury","Stem-cell therapy","CNS tissue","damage of normal brain tissue","complex pathological effects of radiation","primary brain tumors","stem-cell therapies","tissue repair","therapeutic effects","potential mechanisms of engrafted stem cells","induced injury","adverse effects of irradiation","effective non-surgical treatment","potential challenges","lack of effective preventative","treatment of central nervous system","disorders","unique capacity","decades","recent studies","restorative treatments","considerable promise","severe complications","novel option","attempt","functional integrity","metastases","present review","clinical applications","degenerative processes","cognitive impairment","strategy","context"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine upgrade rates of DCIS at needle biopsy to invasive carcinoma at surgery among women who meet the eligibility criteria for AS trials. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of consecutive women at an academic medical center with a diagnosis of DCIS at needle biopsy from 2007 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed for mode of presentation, imaging findings, biopsy pathology results, and surgical outcomes. Each patient with DCIS was evaluated for AS trial eligibility based on published criteria for the COMET, LORD, and LORIS trials. RESULTS During a 10-year period, DCIS was diagnosed in 858 women (mean age 58 years; range 28-89 years). Of the 858 women, 498 (58%) were eligible for the COMET trial, 101 (11.8%) for the LORD trial, and 343 (40%) for the LORIS trial. The rates of upgrade to invasive carcinoma were 12% (60/498) for the COMET trial, 5% (5/101) for the LORD trial, and 11.1% (38/343) for the LORIS trial. The invasive carcinomas ranged from 0.2 to 20 mm, and all were node-negative. CONCLUSIONS Women who meet the eligibility criteria for DCIS AS trials remain at risk for occult invasive carcinoma at presentation, with upgrade rates ranging from 5 to 12%. These findings suggest that more precise criteria are needed to ensure that women with invasive carcinoma are excluded from AS trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oseni, Tawakalitu O; Smith, Barbara L; Lehman, Constance D; Vijapura, Charmi A; Pinnamaneni, Niveditha; Bahl, Manisha","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08576-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trial eligibility","COMET trial","LORD trial","consecutive women","upgrade rates of DCIS","CONCLUSIONS Women","LORIS trials","diagnosis of DCIS","eligibility criteria","ductal carcinoma","rates of upgrade","invasive carcinomas","needle biopsy","published criteria","precise criteria","BACKGROUND Clinical trials","biopsy pathology results","years","mode of presentation","imaging findings","surgical outcomes","Medical records","academic medical center","radiation treatment","surgery","usual care","risk","efficacy of active surveillance","safety","range","retrospective review","mean age","situ","year period","METHODS","study","node-negative","patient"],"language":"en"},

Mean age was 49.34 \u00B1 10.75 years with hypertension being most common comorbidity. Mean BMI was 29.2 \u00B1 4.1 kg/m2. Mean defect area was 51.35 \u00B1 45.09 cm2 and mean mesh size used was 397.56 \u00B1 208.83 cm2. Fifty patients required TAR. Mean duration of surgery was 176.75 \u00B1 62.42 min and blood loss was 78.7 \u00B1 24.4 ml. Mean length of stay was 2.18 \u00B1 1.27 days. Seven cases had paralytic ileus, 5 cases had surgical site infection, and 3 cases had recurrence at 6 months follow up. CONCLUSION e-TEP is a minimally invasive approach which is safe, feasible and also avoids placement of mesh in peritoneal cavity. Since it is a relatively new approach it requires further studies for standardization of techniques, criteria for patient selection and to study long-term outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prakhar, Gupta; Parthasarathi, Ramakrishnan; Cumar, Bharath; Subbaiah, Rajapandian; Nalankilli, V P; Praveen Raj, P; Palanivelu, Chinnusamy","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07595-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPOM","TAR"],"locations":["South India"],"keyphrases":["e-TEP approach ventral hernia repair","CONCLUSION e-TEP","inguinal hernia","invasive approach","alternative approach","new approach","experience of e","Mean age","Mean BMI","Mean duration of surgery","mean mesh size","Mean defect area","Mean length of stay","difficult cases","open repair","maintained data of patients","demographic data","cm2","period","months","placement of mesh","standardization of techniques","year duration","low-recurrence rate","training surgery residents","early recovery","tertiary care center","previous scars","South India","EMILOS","proven benefits","patient selection","postoperative complications","established technique","surgical site infection","pain","criteria","intraoperative details","years","TES","studies","SCOLA","paralytic ileus","IPOM","METHODS","BACKGROUND Laparoscopy","hypertension","common comorbidity","long-term outcomes","peritoneal cavity","MATERIALS","RESULTS","Application","blood loss","days","TAR","surgeons"],"language":"en"},

The present paper is a literature review in which the authors have elaborated on the currently available, relevant references, keeping in mind the epidemiological implications of clinical care. Based on the processed publications, it can be stated that during the interventions primarily affecting the head and neck region, especially in the case of interventions requiring the use of a rotating device, it is essential to fully protect all staff in the room with disposable full clothing, goggles and special masks. Replacement of this equipment and cleaning of the surgery should be done after each intervention and the entire supply team should be prepared for this in advance with training.

To elucidate responses to early HIV-1 replication, we studied blood pDCs in 29 HIV-infected participants who initiated antiretroviral therapy during acute infection and underwent analytic treatment interruption (ATI). An increased frequency of partially activated pDCs was observed in the blood prior to detection of HIV RNA. Concurrent with peak pDC frequency, there was a transient decline in the ability of pDCs to produce IFN\u03B1 in vitro, which correlated with decreased interferon regulatory factory 7 (IRF7) and NF-kB phosphorylation. Levels of phosphorylated IRF7 and NF-kB inversely correlated with plasma IFN\u03B12 levels, implying that pDCs were refractory to in vitro stimulation after IFN\u03B1 production in vivo. After ATI, decreased expression of IFN genes in pDCs inversely correlated with time to viral detection, suggesting that pDC IFN loss is part of an effective early immune response. These data, from a limited cohort, provide a critical first step in understanding the earliest immune response to HIV-1 and suggest that changes in blood pDC frequency and function can be used as an indicator of viral replication before detectable plasma viremia.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Julie L; Takata, Hiroshi; Muir, Roshell; Colby, Donn J; Kroon, Eugene; Crowell, Trevor A; Sacdalan, Carlo; Pinyakorn, Suteeraporn; Pattamaswin, Suwanna; Benjapornpong, Khunthalee; Trichavaroj, Rapee; Tressler, Randall L; Fox, Lawrence; Polonis, Victoria R; Bolton, Diane L; Maldarelli, Frank; Lewin, Sharon R; Haddad, Elias K; Phanuphak, Praphan; Robb, Merlin L; Michael, Nelson L; de Souza, Mark; Phanuphak, Nittaya; Ananworanich, Jintanat; Trautmann, Lydie","journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci130597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV RNA","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood pDCs","ability of pDCs","activated pDCs","blood pDC frequency","early HIV","immune cells","peak pDC frequency","detection of HIV RNA","HIV-infected participants","pDC IFN loss","viral detection","increased frequency","earliest immune response","effective early immune response","IFN\u03B1 production","indicator of viral replication","Levels of phosphorylated IRF7","plasma IFN\u03B12 levels","acute infection","decreased expression of IFN genes","decreased interferon regulatory factory","detectable plasma viremia","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells","robust producers of interferon \u03B1","simian immunodeficiency virus infection","antiretroviral therapy","analytic treatment interruption","step","function","refractory","changes","transient decline","stimulation","time","limited cohort","responses","data","phosphorylation"],"language":"en"},

We would like to compare the quality of life (QOL) and long-term defecative function between these two groups of patients 10 years after reconstructive surgery. METHODS Patients who underwent LAARP between 2001 and 2005 were compared with historical controls treated with PSARP between 1996 and 2000. Degrees of continence were graded by the Krickenbeck classification and Kelly\u0027s score. QOL was assessed by Hirschsprung\u0027s disease/Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life (HAQL) questionnaire. Results were compared using Chi-square test and t test. RESULTS There were 14 LAARP and 7 PSARP patients. All attained voluntary bowel movements. Moderate to severe soiling (Krickenbeck Grade 2 and 3) was found in 3/14 LAARP (21.4%) and 1/7 PSARP (14.3%) patients, p = 1.00. Constipation requiring use of laxatives was present in 3/14 LAARP (28.6%) and 1/7 PSARP (14.3%) patients, p = 0.62. Mean Kelly\u0027s scores were 3.79 \u00B1 0.98 (LAARP) and 4.71 \u00B1 1.25 (PSARP), p = 0.12. No patient required Malone antegrade continence enema (MACE). The QOL scores based on the HAQL questionnaire were comparable between the two groups in all areas except social functioning, in which the LAARP patients attained a significantly lower mean score (26.4 vs 71.7, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION The 10-year outcome between LAARP and PSARP patients in terms of QOL and defecative function is comparable. Impairment in social functioning in these patients is reflected by the self-reported lower level of functioning.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, C W Y; Chung, P H Y; Tam, P K H; Wong, K K Y","journal":"Pediatric surgery international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-019-04606-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kelly"],"organizations":["/Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life","HAQL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAARP patients","PSARP patients","groups of patients","METHODS Patients","QOL scores","recto-vaginal","recto-vesical","terms of QOL","social functioning","Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life","recto-prostatic urethral","recto-bladder neck","fistulas","RV","anorectal pull","HAQL questionnaire","lower mean score","Mean Kelly\u0027s scores","Results","long-term defecative function","self-reported lower level of functioning","Krickenbeck Grade","Krickenbeck classification","Chi-square test","t test","Degrees of continence","Malone antegrade continence enema","RBN","Hirschsprung\u0027s disease","females","year outcome","severe soiling","MACE","years","vs","center","posterior sagittal anorectoplasty","use of laxatives","reconstructive surgery","Constipation","areas","Impairment","voluntary bowel movements","CONCLUSION","historical controls","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high-risk populations are targeted, for example, through population-wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high-risk groups. Targeting of high-risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high-risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health-related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. SEARCH METHODS An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full-text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre-specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta-analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results. MAIN RESULTS We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full-text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High-quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality is lacking.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmidt, Bey-Marri\u00E9; Durao, Solange; Toews, Ingrid; Bavuma, Charlotte M; Hohlfeld, Ameer; Nury, Edris; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Kredo, Tamara","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013212.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378196/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov","World Health","Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk factors of hypertension","opportunistic screening of hypertension","eligible studies","associated risk factors","BACKGROUND Hypertension","similar studies","retrieved studies","management of risk factors","early detection of hypertension","hypertension-related morbidity","ANALYSIS Screening","text screening","behavioural risk factors","managed risk factors","Cochrane Register of Studies","form of screening","abstracts of identified studies","risk of bias","increasing prevalence of hypertension","rigorous research studies","genetic factors","lifestyle factors","effectiveness of different screening strategies","population-wide screening strategies","harms of different screening strategies","total risk approach","health-related costs","health systems","mass","high-risk populations","premature mortality","prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","burden of morbidity","accurate targeting of high-risk groups","review authors","major public health challenge","non-RCTs","pre-specified Cochrane criteria","example","cardiovascular events","SELECTION CRITERIA","population growth","NRCTs","eligibility criteria","titles","entire population","World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform","Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature","fat consumption","publication year","programmatic evidence","implicit assumption","High-quality evidence","meta-analysis","elderly people","DATA COLLECTION","MAIN RESULTS","available resources","harmful alcohol consumption","publication status restrictions","poor management of stress","ICTRP","Embase","MEDLINE","excessive salt","physical inactivity","kidney failure","heart disease","LILACS","adults","blood cholesterol","Information Specialist","CRS-Web","stroke","language","LMICs","disability","Bireme","gender","diabetes","ageing","severe illness","middle-income countries","timely treatment","pairs","narrative synthesis","consideration","texts","SEARCH METHODS","interrupted time series","CBA","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","hospitalisation","discussion","consensus","comorbidities","long term","team of reviewers","OBJECTIVES","Covidence","searches","inception"],"language":"en"},

Allicin is a versatile sulfur-containing organic compound extracted from garlic (Allium sativum L.), which has many pharmacological effects. However, the effect of allicin on the sensitivity of CRC radiotherapy has not been confirmed. The present study is to observe the radiosensitivity effects of allicin and to explore its mechanism in CRC radiotherapy. The proliferation inhibition effects of allicin combined with X-ray radiotherapy in HCT116 cells were measured by growth curve of cell and colony formation assays. The cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 nucleus staining assay. The migration ability of cells was detected by Transwell chamber migration assay. The animal model of CRC was established in BALB/c mice via transplantation of CT26 cell, and the radiosensitization effect of allicin on CRC was detected in vivo. The mRNA expressions of NF-\u03BAB, IKK\u03B2, and I\u03BAB\u03B1 were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expressions of NF-\u03BAB, p-NF-\u03BAB, IKK\u03B2, p-IKK\u03B2, I\u03BAB\u03B1, and p-I\u03BAB\u03B1 were detected by western blotting. Our results showed that allicin improves the sensitivity of X-ray radiotherapy in CRC, and its mechanism may be associated with inhibition of NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, volume changes in the spleen related to nutrition were studied using plethysmographic measurements. Rhythmical and regulatory functions of the spleen were demonstrated in the haemodynamics of the splanchnic region and were described as a \u0022hepatolienal pendulum,\u0022 a \u0022Windkessel function,\u0022 or a \u0022pressure compensation.\u0022 These studies were mainly published in German-speaking countries and have not, as far as is known, been discussed in the English-speaking world so far. SUMMARY This review explores the historical development of the rhythmical regulatory function of the spleen in the splanchnic region. Older studies and results are followed up in the modern literature, wherever possible, up to the present. The clinical relevance is illustrated with portal hypertension (with congestive or hyperdynamic splenomegaly), coeliac disease, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (with functional hyposplenism). Key Message: The spleen\u0027s rhythmical regulatory function in nutrition is based on an autonomous rhythm comprising cycles of contractions and dilations of the spleen of around 1 min. These cycles can be influenced by sympathetically mediated single contractions with a release of pooled blood or by portal vein congestion. After food ingestion, the spleen responds either with contraction according to a vasomotor reaction or postprandial congestion with significant increases in volume. The spleen\u0027s rhythmical function is lost in the clinical picture of portal hypertension or in coeliac disease and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. In the aforementioned gastrointestinal diseases, we recommend taking more account of the haemodynamics between the spleen, liver, and intestine. New innovative techniques for recording splenograms are required which, besides elastographic measurements of spleen stiffness, could offer an important tool for early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic evaluation.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weinzirl, Johannes; Garnitschnig, Lydia; Scheffers, Tom; Andrae, Lukas; Heusser, Peter","journal":"Digestion","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spleen\u0027s rhythmical function","spleen\u0027s rhythmical regulatory function","elastographic measurements of spleen stiffness","portal vein congestion","Windkessel function","regulatory functions","portal vein system","chronic inflammatory bowel diseases","clinical picture of portal hypertension","coeliac disease","cycles of contractions","haemodynamics","centuries","splanchnic region","aforementioned gastrointestinal diseases","postprandial congestion","volume changes","haematological functions","clinical relevance","plethysmographic measurements","Older studies","mediated single contractions","release of pooled blood","diagnosis","role","historical development","early detection","vasomotor reaction","important tool","significant increases","hyperdynamic splenomegaly","recording splenograms","discovery of immunological","autonomous rhythm","functional hyposplenism","Key Message","digestive organ of variable size","New innovative techniques","nutritional metabolism","dilations","therapeutic evaluation","SUMMARY","review","results","liver","account","modern literature","hepatolienal pendulum","BACKGROUND","German","food ingestion","intestine","pressure compensation","English-speaking world","countries"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Non a priori designed secondary analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort study subjects \u003C12 h of life between 240 and 296 weeks gestation. Cerebral saturations (rScO2) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were continuously monitored every 30 s for 96 h. ICA was defined by a 10 min epoch rScO2-MAP correlation coefficient of \u003E0.5. RESULTS Twenty-three of 61 subjects (38%) required dopamine. Time spent with ICA was 23% in dopamine-exposed subjects vs. 14% in those not exposed (p = 0.0001). On the epoch level, time spent with ICA was 15%, 29%, 34%, 37%, and 23% in epochs with dopamine titration of 0, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20 \u03BCg/kg/min, respectively.

METHODS This cross-sectional case control study examined a consecutive sample of patients older than 15 years treated at the epilepsy center of West China Hospital between 01 and 29 February 2020. As controls, sex- and age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients (unrelated to the patients) were also enrolled during the same period. Data on demographics and attention paid to COVID-19 were collected by online questionnaire, data on epilepsy features were collected from electronic medical records, and psychological distress was evaluated using the Kessler 6-item (K-6) psychological distress scale. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The 252 patients and 252 controls in this study were similar along all demographic variables except family income. Patients with epilepsy showed significantly higher K-6 scores than healthy controls and spent significantly more time following the COVID-19 outbreak (both p \u003C 0.001). Univariate analyses associated both diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy and time spent paying attention to COVID-19 with severe psychological distress (defined as K-6 score \u003E 12) (both p \u2264 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent predictors of severe psychological distress: time spent paying attention to COVID-19 (OR 1.172, 95%CI 1.073, 1.280) and diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy (OR 0.283, 95%CI 0.128, 0.623). SIGNIFICANCE During public health outbreaks, clinicians and caregivers should focus not only on seizure control but also on mental health of epilepsy patients, especially those with drug-resistant epilepsy. K-6 scores more than 12 should be indicated as severe psychological distress. This may mean, for example, encouraging patients to engage in other activities instead of excessively following media coverage of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Xiaoting; Zhou, Dong; Li, Zhe; Zeng, Guojun; Hao, Nanya; Li, Enzhi; Li, Wenjing; Deng, Aiping; Lin, Mintao; Yan, Bo","journal":"Epilepsia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kessler"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","West China"],"keyphrases":["severity of psychological distress","psychological distress scale","epilepsy features","drug-resistant epilepsy","mental health of epilepsy patients","COVID","independent predictors of severe psychological distress","potential risk factors of severe psychological distress","healthy controls","time","attention","epilepsy center of West China Hospital","consecutive sample of patients older","diagnosis of drug","multivariate logistic regression","Data","scores","cross-sectional case control study","seizure control","southwest China","age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients","public health outbreaks","electronic medical records","demographic variables","clinicians","caregivers","years","online questionnaire","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODS","sex","family income","media coverage","Univariate analyses","activities","demographics","Kessler","item","OBJECTIVE","example","period"],"language":"en"},

The impact of the pandemic and the consequent lockdown on medical emergencies other than those SARS-CoV2 related is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiologic impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic on hospital admission for severe emergent cardiovascular diseases (SECDs) in a single Northern Italy large tertiary referral center. Methods and Results We quantified SECDs admissions to the Cardiology Division of Udine University Hospital between March 1st 2020 and March 31st 2020 and compared to those of the same time frame during 2019. Compared to March 2019, we observed a significant reduction in all SECDs admissions: -30% for ST segment elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (STE-ACS), -66% for Non STE-ACS and -50% for severe bradyarrhythmia. Conclusions A significant decrease in all SECDs admissions has been observed during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and was unlikely caused by a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Fear of contagion may have contributed to the unpredictable drop of SECDs. Social education about early recognition of symptoms of life-threatening cardiac conditions requiring appropriate care in a timely fashion may help to reduce this counter-productive phenomenon.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toniolo, Mauro; Negri, Francesco; Antonutti, Marco; Mas\u00E8, Marco; Facchin, Domenico","journal":"Journal of the American Heart Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.017122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Udine University Hospital","ST"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["SECDs admissions","SARS-CoV2 pandemic","unpredictable drop of SECDs","severe emergent cardiovascular diseases","severe bradyarrhythmia","significant reduction","STE-ACS","epicenters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","incidence of cardiovascular diseases","hospital admission","epidemiologic impact of Coronavirus Disease","significant decrease","BackgroundNorthern-Italy","ST segment elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome","Cardiology Division of Udine University Hospital","single Northern Italy large tertiary referral center","early recognition of symptoms","life-threatening cardiac conditions","appropriate care","medical emergencies","consequent lockdown","timely fashion","Social education","study","Conclusions","Europe","counter-productive phenomenon","Methods","Fear of contagion","time frame","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Sagittal and frontal plane tibial and femoral joint angles of 40 limbs were measured twice by three observers with different levels of experience. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was determined by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). An ICC \u003E 0.75 was considered high correlation, 0.74 \u003E ICC \u003E 0.60 good correlation, 0.59 \u003E ICC \u003E 0.4 fair correlation and an ICC \u003C 0.40 poor correlation.

A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1093/humupd/dmz048","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32103270","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in 1-3% of all couples trying to conceive. No consensus exists regarding when to perform testing for risk factors in couples with RPL. Some guidelines recommend testing if a patient has had two pregnancy losses whereas others advise to test after three losses. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence of abnormal test results for RPL amongst patients with two versus three or more pregnancy losses. We also aimed to contribute to the debate regarding whether the investigations for RPL should take place after two or three or more pregnancy losses. SEARCH METHODS Relevant studies were identified by a systematic search in OVID Medline and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. A search for RPL was combined with a broad search for terms indicative of number of pregnancy losses, screening/testing for pregnancy loss or the prevalence of known risk factors. Meta-analyses were performed in case of adequate clinical and statistical homogeneity. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. OUTCOMES From a total of 1985 identified publications, 21 were included in this systematic review and 19 were suitable for meta-analyses. For uterine abnormalities (seven studies, odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.79-1.27, I2 = 0%) and for antiphospholipid syndrome (three studies, OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.25, I2 = 0%) we found low quality evidence for a lack of a difference in prevalence of abnormal test results between couples with two versus three or more pregnancy losses. We found insufficient evidence of a difference in prevalence of abnormal test results between couples with two versus three or more pregnancy losses for chromosomal abnormalities (10 studies, OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55-1.10), inherited thrombophilia (five studies) and thyroid disorders (two studies, OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.06-4.56). WIDER IMPLICATIONS A difference in prevalence in uterine abnormalities and antiphospholipid syndrome is unlikely in women with two versus three pregnancy losses. We cannot exclude a difference in prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities, inherited thrombophilia and thyroid disorders following testing after two versus three pregnancy losses. The results of this systematic review may support investigations after two pregnancy losses in couples with RPL, but it should be stressed that additional studies of the prognostic value of test results used in the RPL population are urgently needed. An evidenced-based treatment is not currently available in the majority of cases when abnormal test results are present.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Dijk, Myrthe M; Kolte, Astrid M; Limpens, Jacqueline; Kirk, Emma; Quenby, Siobhan; van Wely, Madelon; Goddijn, Mari\u00EBtte","journal":"Human reproduction update","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmz048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPL","OVID Medline"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pregnancy losses","prevalence of abnormal test results","couples","additional studies","prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities","difference","testing","systematic search","RPL population","BACKGROUND Recurrent pregnancy loss","prognostic value of test results","systematic review","SEARCH METHODS Relevant studies","uterine abnormalities","prevalence of known risk factors","broad search","inherited thrombophilia","thyroid disorders","current evidence","antiphospholipid syndrome","investigations","insufficient evidence","low quality evidence","Meta-analyses","I2","identified publications","terms indicative of number","screening","majority of cases","case of adequate clinical","OVID Medline","EMBASE","lack","women","statistical homogeneity","RATIONALE","aim","odds ratio","patients","WIDER IMPLICATIONS","inception","total","evidenced-based treatment","Newcastle-Ottawa scale","OBJECTIVE","OUTCOMES","debate","place","guidelines","consensus"],"language":"en"},

It seems that the appropriate identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the best strategy to limit COVID-19 transmission. However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, symptoms may be very mild or atypical. There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID-19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles was shown in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 are not an accidental finding, but they may result from direct digestive involvement. Patients with new-onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.

The etiological agent was quickly identified as a betacoronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2), which has since caused a pandemic. Several methods allowing for the specific detection of viral nucleic acids have been established, but these only allow detection of the virus during a short period of time, generally during acute infection. Serological assays are urgently needed to conduct serosurveys, to understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection. Here we describe a detailed protocol for expression of antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that can serve as a substrate for immunological assays, as well as a two-stage serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Such macrocycles find wide use in studies ranging from energy sciences to photomedicine. The key transformation (-CH3 \u2192 -CHO) is often inefficient, however, thereby crimping the synthesis of hydroporphyrins. The first part of the review summarizes 12 representative conditions for Riley oxidation across diverse (non-hydrodipyrrin) substrates. An interlude summarizes the proposed mechanisms and provides context concerning the nature of various selenium species other than SeO2. The second part of the review comprehensively reports the conditions and results upon Riley oxidation of 45 1-methyltetrahydrodipyrrins and 1-methyldihydrodipyrrins. A comparison of the results provides insights into the tolerable structural features for Riley oxidation of hydrodipyrrins. In general, Riley oxidation of dihydrodipyrrins has a broad scope toward substituents, but proceeds in only modest yield. Too few tetrahydrodipyrrins have been examined to draw conclusions concerning scope.

Methods We extracted data regarding all patients hospitalized at our hospital with COVID-19 infection between March 1 and April 4, 2020. Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs). The primary composite endpoint was admission to intensive care unit (ICU), shock, or death. Results We had a total of 43 patients tested for COVID-19 at the emergency room (ER) or during hospitalization, 16 (37%) of whom were admitted with COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 65.5 years and 75% were males. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (81%). A loss of smell and taste sensations were reported by three (19%) patients. Low oxygen saturation was present in 38% of patients, whilst 31% were hypotensive on admission. Hyponatremia (50%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 100%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 80%) were common.

Even with our growing understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of music, the answer to this question remains unclear. One method for conceiving possible representations is to use artificial neural networks, which can provide biologically plausible models of cognition. One could train networks to solve musical problems, and then study how these networks encode musical properties. However, researchers rarely examine network structure in detail because networks are difficult to interpret, and because many assume that networks capture informal or subsymbolic properties. Here we report very high correlations between network connection weights and discrete Fourier phase spaces used to represent musical sets. This is remarkable because there is no clear mathematical relationship between network learning rules and discrete Fourier analysis.

Here, we present the final analysis outcomes. METHODS A prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study involving patients who received tolvaptan for the treatment of liver cirrhosis with hepatic edema with an insufficient response to conventional diuretics. The observation period was up to 6 months. Effectiveness evaluation included changes in body weight and clinical symptoms. Safety analysis included evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS Case reports of 1111 patients were collected. Of these, 1109 were included in the safety analysis and 1098 in the effectiveness analysis. The mean age was 69.4 \u00B1 11.5 years and 695 (62.7%) patients were male. After tolvaptan treatment, a decrease in body weight from baseline was - 2.6 \u00B1 2.7 kg on day 7 and - 3.8 \u00B1 4.1 kg on day 14. Moreover, clinical symptoms significantly improved over the 14-day treatment. Frequently reported ADRs were thirst (6.6%), hepatic encephalopathy (2.3%), dehydration (1.5%), and hypernatremia (1.2%). A serum sodium level of \u2265 150 mEq/L was reported in five patients (0.5%). Multivariate analyses showed that the baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (cut-off value: 22.4 mg/dL) was the predictive factor for tolvaptan treatment response. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that tolvaptan was effective and well-tolerated in liver cirrhosis patients with hepatic edema. In the real-world clinical setting, tolvaptan provides a useful option for the treatment of hepatic edema.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sakaida, Isao; Terai, Shuji; Kurosaki, Masayuki; Okada, Mitsuru; Hirano, Takahiro; Fukuta, Yasuhiko","journal":"Journal of gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-020-01691-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of hepatic edema","safety of tolvaptan","tolvaptan treatment response","day treatment","treatment of liver cirrhosis","Safety analysis","effectiveness analysis","Japanese liver cirrhosis patients","hepatic encephalopathy","clinical symptoms","Effectiveness evaluation","real-world clinical settings","body weight","final analysis outcomes","reported ADRs","non-interventional study","insufficient response","large-scale post-marketing surveillance study","serum sodium level","RESULTS Case reports","baseline blood urea nitrogen","evaluation of adverse drug reactions","BUN","changes","useful option","BACKGROUND","decrease","predictive factor","cut-off value","Multivariate analyses","conventional diuretics","METHODS","mEq","thirst","observation period","months","mean age","years","CONCLUSIONS","dehydration","male","hypernatremia"],"language":"en"},

Degradation of pericancerous extracellular matrix leading to cancer cell invasion by matrix metalloproteases is well known evidence. On the other hand, several cell-surface proteases, including type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), also induce progression through activation of growth factors, protease activating receptors and other proteases. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) known as a multifunctional growth factor that upregulates cancer cell motility, invasiveness, proliferative, and anti-apoptotic activities through phosphorylation of MET (a specific receptor of HGF). HGF secreted as inactive zymogen (pro-HGF) from cancer associated stromal fibroblasts, and the proteolytic activation by several TTSPs including matriptase and hepsin is required. The activation is strictly regulated by HGF activator inhibitors (HAIs) in physiological condition. However, downregulation is frequently observed in cancers. Indeed, overactivation of MET by upregulation of matriptase and hepsin accompanied by the downregulation of HAIs in urological cancers (prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and bladder cancer) are also reported, a phenomenon observed in cancer cells with malignant phenotype, and correlated with poor prognosis.

Firstly, a Siamese network with two identical convolutional neural network (CNN) sub-networks and a logistic regression for leukocyte five classification is designed, which can learn not only distinguishing features but also a similarity metric. Then for each category of the leukocytes, a typical sample is selected by the hematologist. To train the Siamese network, a leukocyte and a typical sample that belong to the same category make up a genuine pair and the leukocyte with the rest four typical samples respectively make up four impostor pairs. Obviously, the number of the genuine pairs is lesser than that of the impostor pairs. Thus, a data augmentation method suitable for leukocyte is used to enrich the amount of the genuine pairs. By training the Siamese network using the genuine pairs and impostor pairs, the Siamese network can not only shorten the similarity metric between the leukocyte and the same category of the typical sample but also increase the similarity metrics between the leukocyte and the different categories of the typical samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve 98.8% average testing accuracy.

A biomarker of whole-grain intake and type of whole-grain intake would be useful for quantifying the exposure to whole-grain intake. In this review, we aim to review the evidence on the potential biomarkers for whole-grain intake in the literature. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane database. In total, 39 papers met the inclusion criteria following the PRISMA guidelines and were included. The relative validity, responsiveness, and reproducibility of these markers were assessed for short-, medium-, and long-term exposure as important criteria for the potential use of these biomarkers from a clinical and research perspective. We found three major groups of biomarkers: (1) alkylresorcinol, as well as its homologs and metabolites, assessed in plasma, adipose tissue biopsies, erythrocyte membranes, and urine; (2) avenacosides, assessed in urine samples; and (3) benzoxazinoid-derived phenylacetamide sulfates, assessed in blood and urine samples.

Recent evidence on effectiveness of primary care interventions has attracted renewed calls for their implementation. This review aims to synthesize evidence pertaining to primary care interventions on these two diseases, evaluated and tested in LMICs. METHODS Two reviewers conducted an electronic search of three databases (Pubmed, EMBASE and Web of Science) and screened for eligible articles. Interventions covering health promotion, prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation activities at the PHC or community level were included. Studies published in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, from January 2007 to January 2017, were included. Key extraction variables included the 12 criteria identified by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework (ICCCF) was used to guide analysis and reporting of results. RESULTS 198 articles were analyzed. The strategies focused on healthcare service organization (76.5%), community level (9.7 %), creating a positive policy environment (3.6%) and strategies covering multiple domains (10.2%). Studies included related to the following topics: description or testing of interventions (n=81; 41.3%), implementation or evaluation projects (n=42; 21.4%), quality improvement initiatives (n=15; 7.7%), screening and prevention efforts (n=26; 13.2%), management of HTN or DM (n=13; 6.6%), integrated health services (n=10; 5.1%), knowledge and attitude surveys (n=5; 2.5%), cost-effective lab tests (n=2; 1%) and policy making efforts (n=2; 1%). Most studies reported interventions by non-specialists (n=86; 43.4%) and multidisciplinary teams (n=49; 25.5%). CONCLUSION Only 198 articles were found over a 10 year period which demonstrates the limited published research on highly prevalent diseases in LMIC. This review shows the variety and complexity of approaches that have been tested to address HTN and DM in LMICs and highlights the elements of interventions needed to be addressed in order to strengthen delivery of care. Most studies reported little information regarding implementation processes to allow replication. Given the need for multi-component complex interventions, study designs and evaluation techniques will need to be adapted by including process evaluations versus simply effectiveness or outcome evaluations.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Correia, Jorge C\u00E9sar; Lachat, Sarah; Lagger, Gr\u00E9goire; Chappuis, Fran\u00E7ois; Golay, Alain; Beran, David","journal":"BMC public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7842-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752801/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHC","HTN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["testing of interventions","elements of interventions","Studies","effectiveness of primary care interventions","multi-component complex interventions","Innovative Care","delivery of care","Replication","prevalent diseases","implementation processes","prevention efforts","strategies","community level","management of HTN","need","LMICs","eligible articles","guide","Intervention Description","Recent evidence","evaluation techniques","outcome evaluations","health promotion","evaluation projects","process evaluations","reporting of results","limited published research","integrated health services","positive policy environment","study designs","Pubmed","rehabilitation activities","following topics","criteria","electronic search","databases","ICCCF","Chronic Conditions Framework","treatment","renewed calls","Web of Science","middle-income countries","little information","EMBASE","leading cause of morbidity","year period","English","French","PHC","diabetes mellitus","Template","checklist","non-specialists","BACKGROUND Hypertension","healthcare service organization","Key extraction variables","Portuguese","Spanish","mortality","METHODS","reviewers","variety","analysis","knowledge","attitude surveys","quality improvement initiatives","cost-effective lab tests","order","screening","complexity of approaches","multiple domains","multidisciplinary teams","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This review aims to summarise the evidence on the strength of the association between dietary patterns and the prevalence and incidence of COPD.

Two reviewers independently reviewed each manuscript through the screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessment stages. Data from eight observational studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and random-effects meta-analysis was subsequently conducted. Results Eight observational studies (all eight reporting on healthy dietary patterns and three on unhealthy dietary patterns) met the inclusion criteria and data were extracted to include in the meta-analysis. Consumption of a healthy dietary pattern was associated with a lower risk of COPD (pooled OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.94). Consumption of unhealthy dietary patterns was associated with a higher risk of COPD (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84-1.76); however, the results were not statistically significant and had high heterogeneity (I2=91%). Conclusion Our results suggests that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a lower prevalence of COPD, while unhealthy dietary patterns are not.

While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm.

First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels. The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far. As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis. The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lippi, Giuseppe; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Bovo, Chiara; Plebani, Mario","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of anti-SARS-CoV","respiratory symptoms","antibodies","recent emergence","vast majority of COVID","etiological diagnosis of COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","viral antigens","promising information","biological materials","lower respiratory tract specimens","emergence of new local outbreaks","novel coronavirus disease","direct identification of viral RNA","molecular biology techniques","definitive conclusions","throat washing","irreplaceable contribution","managed care","diagnostic reasoning","stools","saliva","viable opportunity","urine","patients","purposes of epidemiologic surveillance","accuracy","reliability","concerns serological testing","preliminary investigations","blood","vigilance","responsiveness","persistent neutralizing activity","IgG","sustained immune response","human pathologies","onset of fever","availability of rapid tests","weeks","portable immunoassays","Laboratory medicine","valid alternatives","long time","diagnostics","foreseeable future","highest possible levels","general basis","exception","paradigm","standpoints"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with containment measures in a pandemic situation should be more comfortable for some people than for other people. Thus, individual differences should be associated with engagement with containment measures. OBJECTIVE To investigate to what extent two personality traits, extroversion and conscientiousness, are associated with engagement with two containment measures (social distancing and handwashing). METHODS The sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults aged 18-78 years, who answered the Big Five Inventory 2 Short (BFI-2-S) and factors from the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). RESULTS Higher scores for extroversion were associated with lower means for social distancing (p \u003C 0.001) and higher scores for conscientiousness were associated with higher means for social distancing and handwashing (p \u003C 0.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of endostatin on Wnt signaling pathway of stem-like cells in bladder cancer in tumor microenvironment. The qRT-PCR assay and western blot were conducted to evaluate related factors expressions of Wnt signaling pathway in both bladder cancer 5637 cells and stem cells. Loss of function assays were carried out to detect the influence of endostatin on the proliferation, migration, cell proliferation and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. We demonstrated that endostatin triggered the degradation of \u03B2-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling. The activation of the endostatin blocked \u03B2-catenin function and inhibited cell growth and migration of bladder cancer. In order to verify that the Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited by endostain in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells, the Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling pathway-associated molecules, including DKK1, LRP5, TCF4, \u03B2-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, were evaluated in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells. The western blotting results showed that expressions of these molecules were remarkably increased in the 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells compared to the control group. In summary, our study demonstrated that endostatin inhibited angiogenesis.

To better understand the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions, seventy-five of 100 pigs infected with PRRSV-JA142 and 25 control pigs were euthanized at 3, 10, 21, 28 and 35 days post-challenge (dpc). Blood, lung, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial lymph node (BLN) samples were collected to evaluate the cellular immune responses. The humoral responses were evaluated by measuring the levels of anti-PRRSV IgG and serum virus-neutralizing (SVN) antibodies. Consequently, the highest viral loads in the sera and lungs of the infected pigs were detected between 3 and 10 dpc, and these resulted in moderate to mild interstitial pneumonia, which resolved accompanied by the clearance of most of the virus by 28 dpc. At peak viremia, the frequencies of alveolar macrophages in infected pigs were significantly decreased, whereas the monocyte-derived DC/macrophage and conventional DC frequencies were increased, and these effects coincided with the early induction of local T-cell responses and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lungs, BAL, and BLN as early as 10 dpc. Conversely, the systemic T-cell responses measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were delayed and significantly induced only after the peak viremic stage between 3 and 10 dpc. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of immune responses in the lung could be the key elements for restraining PRRSV through the early induction of T-cell responses at the sites of virus replication.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazki, Salik; Khatun, Amina; Jeong, Chang-Gi; Mattoo, Sameer Ul Salam; Gu, Suna; Lee, Sim-In; Kim, Seung-Chai; Park, Ji-Hyo; Yang, Myoun-Sik; Kim, Bumseok; Park, Choi-Kyu; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Kim, Won-Il","journal":"Veterinary research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-020-00789-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dpc","infected pigs","humoral responses","systemic T-cell responses","early induction of local T-cell responses","activation of immune responses","cellular immune responses","control pigs","early induction of T","restraining PRRSV","PRRSV-JA142","serum virus-neutralizing","respiratory syndrome virus","lungs","sites of virus replication","BAL","BLN","levels of anti-PRRSV IgG","conventional DC frequencies","dynamics of host","peak viremia","clearance of porcine reproductive","frequencies of alveolar macrophages","monocyte-derived DC","peak viremic stage","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","host-associated defence system responsible","bronchial lymph node","sera","presence of proinflammatory cytokines","bronchoalveolar lavage","samples","chemokines","key elements","SVN","pathogen interactions","highest viral loads","mild interstitial pneumonia","antibodies","days post-challenge","results","effects"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Qualifying primary studies had a comparison group, were conducted in countries ranked very high on the United Nations Human Development Index, published in English, and evaluated obstetric and gynecologic health outcomes. Cochrane Collaboration\u0027s tool and ROBINS-I tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Summary of evidence tables were created using the United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table for Evidence Reviews. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, RESULTS Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms. CONCLUSION Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics. Further well-designed studies are needed to examine these interventions and others to generate evidence that can inform decisions about implementation of newer telehealth technologies into obstetrics and gynecology practice.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeNicola, Nathaniel; Grossman, Daniel; Marko, Kathryn; Sonalkar, Sarita; Butler Tobah, Yvonne S; Ganju, Nihar; Witkop, Catherine T; Henderson, Jillian T; Butler, Jessica L; Lowery, Curtis","journal":"Obstetrics and gynecology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31977782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov","United Nations Human Development Index"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of telehealth interventions","CONCLUSION Telehealth interventions","improved obstetric outcomes","fetal outcomes","gynecologic health outcomes","Telehealth provision of medication abortion services","implementation of newer telehealth technologies","similar clinical outcomes","early abortion","Evidence Reviews","medical abortion services","Summary of evidence tables","text-based study","early access","high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits","improved access","Cochrane Library","breastfeeding","high-risk obstetrics","Cochrane Collaboration\u0027s tool","well-designed studies","METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Qualifying primary studies","United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table","perinatal smoking cessation","increased oral contraception rates","continuation of oral","injectable contraception","primary literature","published abstracts","Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials","app-based intervention","transmitted infection test results","United Nations Human Development Index","need","improvements","EMBASE","diagnosed preeclampsia","notification","schedule optimization","person care","comparison group","women","comprehensive search","English","decisions","gynecology practice","urinary incontinence symptoms","gestational hypertension","PubMed","criteria","countries","reductions","months","ROBINS","DATA SOURCES","INTEGRATION","utility","inclusion","participants","MEDLINE","TABULATION","risk of bias","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Movement disorder (Parkinson\u0027s disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson\u0027s disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient\u0027s tolerance to potential therapy disruption. Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miocinovic, Svjetlana; Ostrem, Jill L; Okun, Michael S; Bullinger, Katie L; Riva-Posse, Patricio; Gross, Robert E; Buetefisch, Cathrin M","journal":"Journal of Parkinson\u0027s disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-202072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333552/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epilepsy patients","interruption of DBS therapy","interruption of therapy","DBS system infection","obsessive compulsive disorder","DBS-withdrawal syndrome","neuropsychiatric disorder","Movement disorder","elective procedures","consideration battery status","existing DBS systems","status dystonicus","neurostimulator battery","triage procedures","Parkinson\u0027s disease","potential therapy disruption","result of therapy cessation","Urgent intervention","non-urgent clinic visits","hospital system regulations","life-threatening worsening of seizures","hospital resources","generalized dystonia","Elective interventions","telemedicine visits","Tourette syndrome","life-threatening complication","case basis","health crisis","pandemic crisis","deep brain stimulation","patient\u0027s tolerance","essential tremor","safety","respect","end of life","depression","implantable pulse generator","resource utilization","new implantations","varying degrees of symptom","electrical integrity interrogation","initial programming","device malfunction","replacement","unique challenges","decision","patient programmers","phone consultations","spread of COVID","medical centers","emergent surgery","Scheduling"],"language":"en"},

Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant\u0027s social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life. Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. MAIN RESULTS We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months\u0027 follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months\u0027 follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short-Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD -7.66, 95% CI -24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD -7.18, 95% CI -16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI -8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD -3.25, 95% CI -15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD -3.60, 95% CI -9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI -2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noone, Chris; McSharry, Jenny; Smalle, Mike; Burns, Annette; Dwan, Kerry; Devane, Declan; Morrissey, Eimear C","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social isolation","symptoms of loneliness","included studies","single review author","rapid review","review authors","symptoms of depression","Video calls","UCLA Loneliness Scale","participants","effectiveness of video","older people","video conferencing","participant\u0027s social circle","self-report measures of loneliness","primary outcomes","older adults","study designs","Geriatric Depression Scale","months","quality of life","MD","study limitations","secondary outcomes","primary objective","certainty of evidence","excluded abstracts","Total scores range","usual care","quasi-RCTs","cluster quasi-randomised trials","remaining abstracts","cluster designs","mean difference","current COVID","inclusion","pandemic","conflicts","controlled trials","current crisis","DATA COLLECTION","mean age","interventions","physical health","risk factors","computers","MEDLINE","smartphones","tablets","levels","internet","ANALYSIS","intention","fixed-effect meta-analyses","GRADE approach","frequency of contact","SELECTION CRITERIA","nursing homes","imprecision","use","restrictions","core component","MAIN RESULTS","references of relevant systematic reviews","countries","existing acquaintances","SEARCH METHODS","PsycINFO","CINAHL","movement","OBJECTIVES","indirectness","BACKGROUND","confidence interval","possible trigger","consensus","baseline","process","text articles","years","ratings","place","samples","uncertain evidence","physical function","physical role","effectiveness of video calls","mental health","poor health","good health","social function","emotional role","pain scores","vitality scores","question health survey","representative participants","future studies","months\u0027 follow-up","three-month scores","outcomes of symptoms","year follow-up","difference","review","certainty","different aspects of quality","Future research","Short-Form","Taiwanese adaptation","small effect","rigorous methods","area","people","finding","loneliness","subscales","population","SF","range of settings","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","need of improvement"],"language":"en"}]}

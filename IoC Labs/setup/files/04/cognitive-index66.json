We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations using satellite data and a network of \u003E10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find remarkable declines in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: -29 % with 95% confidence interval -44% to -13%), ozone (O3: -11%; -20% to -2%) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: -9%; -28% to 10%) during the first two weeks of lockdown (n = 27 countries). These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to NO2. Pollutant anomalies were related to short-term health outcomes using empirical exposure-response functions. We estimate that there was a net total of 7400 (340 to 14600) premature deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided during two weeks post-lockdown. In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related avoided premature mortality was 1400 (1100 to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively. Assuming that the lockdown-induced deviations in pollutant concentrations are maintained for the duration of 2020, we estimate 0.78 (0.09 to 1.5) million premature deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric asthma cases could be avoided globally. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings illustrate the potential health benefits gained from reducing \u0027business as usual\u0027 air pollutant emissions from economic activities.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venter, Zander S; Aunan, Kristin; Chowdhury, Sourangsu; Lelieveld, Jos","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc0ef2c4bd54f0adda9e453eacce9fd916901723.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060673","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["lockdown response","weeks of lockdown","weeks post-lockdown","state of global lockdown","pollutant concentrations","premature deaths","air pollutant emissions","lockdown-induced deviations","related avoided premature mortality","ground-level air pollution concentrations","Pollutant anomalies","NO2","pediatric asthma cases","air quality stations","long-distance transport of PM2","global economic activity","ground-level nitrogen dioxide","satellite data","satellite measures","economic activities","short-term health outcomes","potential health benefits","empirical exposure-response functions","remarkable declines","network","business","troposphere","findings","unprecedented reduction","effects of meteorological variability","heterogeneous changes relative","accounting","fine particulate matter","COVID","results","China","India","countries","duration","confidence interval","ozone","O3","net total","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Observing such a high prevalence in COVID-infected patients was somehow unexpected since the 30% prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in influenza patients has been attributed to the action of oseltamivir on anti-Aspergillus immunity. Almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients develop ARDS and are likely to receive high-dose steroids or immunomodulatory therapies to prevent worsening as suggested by reports from China. In the COVID-19 patients with putative invasive aspergillosis, antifungal prophylactic therapy may be questioned to avoid increased lung inflammation that may compromise the outcome. This issue remains to be addressed in future clinical trials. We are strongly convinced that testing deep lung specimens for Aspergillus in severe COVID-19 patients should be recommended.

In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goyal, Ashish; Cardozo-Ojeda, E.

Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak\u0027s source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, H.-Y.; Han, G.; Yuan, H.; Pfeiffer, S.; Mao, A.; Wu, L.; Pfeiffer, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28532db48a0ab58a8d8f8c0c465876c409aa82dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.20089482v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hong Kong","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["effects of quarantine","quarantine measures","early quarantine","Hong Kong","quarantine-based measures","start of quarantine necessary","symptom onset","transmission dynamics of COVID","current COVID","reproduction number of COVID","days","community spread","model fitting","meta-population model","quarantining infected cases","timing","subsequent community infections","mainland China","effects of border control","severe control measures","Results","early expansion period","estimated incubation time","rapid expansion","virus transmissibility","daily transportation data","presence of population immunity","local confirmed case data","massive influx of travellers","Lunar New Year festival","region","key factor","epidemiological parameters","global pandemic","SEIQR","Wuhan","valuable insights","outbreak\u0027s source","Background","intrusive interventions","city lockdown","Conclusion","challenges","account","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) self-quarantine of infected individuals. Using a standard epidemiological model (SIR), we show here that by identification and isolation of the majority of infectious individuals, including those who may be asymptomatic, the reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. We replicate these observations in a more complex stochastic dynamic model on a social network graph. We also find that the testing regime would be additive to other interventions, and be effective at any level of prevalence. If adopted as a policy, any industrial society could sustain the regime for as long as it takes to find a safe and effective cure or vaccine. Our model also indicates that unlike sampling-based tests, population-scale testing does not need to be very accurate: false negative rates up to 15% could be tolerated if 80% comply with testing every ten days, and false positives can be almost arbitrarily high when a high fraction of the population is already effectively quarantined. Testing at the required scale would be feasible if existing qPCR-based methods are scaled up and multiplexed. A mass produced, low throughput field test kit could also be carried out at home. Economic analysis also supports the feasibility of the approach: current reagent costs for tests are in the range of a dollar or less, and the estimated benefits for population-scale testing are so large that the policy would be cost-effective even if the costs were larger by more than two orders of magnitude. To identify both active and previous infections, both viral RNA and antibodies could be tested. All technologies to build such test kits, and to produce them in the scale required to test the entire world\u0027s population exist already. Integrating them, scaling up production, and implementing the testing regime will require resources and planning, but at a scale that is very small compared to the effort that every nation would devote to defending itself against a more traditional foe.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taipale, J.; Romer, P.; Linnarsson, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e23cbdcfe6ad83648de16283bd0f4187c1b60d64.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20078329v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population-scale testing","testing regime","required scale","sampling-based tests","entire world\u0027s population","policy","test kits","standard epidemiological model","complex stochastic dynamic model","existing qPCR-based methods","high fraction","effective cure","false positives","industrial society","additional intervention","low throughput field test kit","current reagent costs","majority of infectious individuals","eventual reopening of society","false negative rates","self-quarantine of infected individuals","feasibility","help","social network graph","approach","reproduction number R0 of SARS","previous infections","viral RNA","essential jobs","estimated benefits","pandemic","protection","people","isolation","mass","planning","antibodies","observations","control","vaccine","SIR","range","interventions","resources","effort","Economic analysis","COVID","identification","dollar","level of prevalence","days","technologies","orders of magnitude","traditional foe","nation","epidemic","home"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. Results: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CI): 4.89 - 8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CI 3.05 - 5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. Conclusion: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Epithelial cells are central to the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. In chronic diseases, increasing age is a principle risk factor. In acute diseases, such as COVID-19, children suffer less severe symptoms than adults and have a lower rate of mortality. Few studies have explored differences between airway epithelial cells in children and adults to explain this age dependent variation in diseases. Here, we perform bulk RNA sequencing studies in laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium, FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells, as well as in vitro cell proliferation experiments, to address the intrinsic molecular differences between paediatric and adult airway basal cells. We find that, while the cellular composition of the paediatric and adult tracheobronchial epithelium is broadly similar, in cell culture, paediatric airway epithelial cells displayed higher colony forming ability, better in vitro growth and outcompeted adult cells in competitive proliferation assays. In RNA sequencing experiments, we observed potentially important differences in airway epithelial gene expression between samples from children and adults. However, genes known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were not differentially expressed between children and adults.

Summary Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are single strand RNA viruses. To date, there are four so-called \u00AB classical \u00BB or \u00AB novel \u00BB HCoVs, characterized by a winter circulation. These coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infection in general population. However, HCoVs are associated to more severe respiratory tract infection among susceptible population. Indeed, HCoVs account for 2 to 7% of hospitalizations due to a respiratory infection, particularly among children, immunocompromised or elderly people. Thereby, HCoVs are included in the panel of respiratory viruses detected in routine using molecular biology tools. These four circulating HCoVs have to be distinguished from the two emerging HCoVs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These later are associated to a more severe respiratory infection and differ from other HCoVs by their increased epidemic potential, their more important health impact, and their atypical circulation. Such as paramyxoviruses and Influenza viruses, coronaviruses have to be monitored due to their associated risk of emergence in human population from animal reservoirs.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kin, Nathalie; Vabret, Astrid","journal":"Revue Francophone des Laboratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbc5841dfb71e2b468e97635a2eb273a6492be2d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773035X16303690; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1773035X16303690","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["To date","to their associated risk","HCoVs account","more severe respiratory infection","to be monitored","associated to more severe respiratory tract infection among susceptible population","mild respiratory infection in general population","These four circulating HCoVs","to be distinguished from the two emerging HCoVs","differ from other HCoVs","infection respiratoire","their atypical circulation","population humaine","population g\u00E9n\u00E9rale","These coronaviruses","coronavirus humains","coronavirus \u00E9mergents","infections respiratoires mod\u00E9r\u00E9es","coronavirus dits circulants","emergence in human population from animal reservoirs","Influenza viruses","virus Influenza","panel de virus respiratoires recherch\u00E9s","pathologies respiratoires","winter circulation","their more important health impact","included in the panel","respiratory viruses detected in routine using molecular biology tools","SARS","Summary Human coronaviruses","These later","MERS","mode de circulation atypique","their increased epidemic potential","diagnostics de routine","impact sanitaire","single strand RNA viruses","four so","r\u00E9servoir animal","particularly among children","responsible","immunocompromised","enfants","called","classical","risque","Such as paramyxoviruses","elderly people","potentiel \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","\u00E9mergence","particulier","novel","outils de biologie mol\u00E9culaire","characterized","Thereby","However","hospitalizations","personnes \u00E2g\u00E9es","ARN simple brin","hospitalisations cons\u00E9cutives","instar des paramyxovirus","nouveaux","origine","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","Indeed","populations susceptibles"],"language":"fr"},

However severity of disease varies considerably and understanding physiological changes that may link to poor outcomes is important. Although increased serum ferritin has been observed in COVID-19 patients consistent with inflammation, other iron parameters have not been examined to our knowledge. Because iron is required for immunity and oxygen utilisation, and dysregulated iron homeostasis has been observed in COPD, we investigated serum iron concentrations in 30 patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission. All patients had low serum iron but patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure had more profound hypoferraemia. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to identify severe hypoxemia was 0.95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and non-severe hypoxemia was a serum iron concentration of 2.9 micromol/L. By linear regression, serum iron was associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2. In conclusion, profound hypoferraemia identifies COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia. Serum iron is a simple biomarker that could be usefully employed to stratify patients and monitor disease. Severe hypoferraemia may plausibly impair critical iron-dependent processes such as lymphocyte responses and hypoxia sensing, contributing to pathology, and is potentially treatable.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, A.; Frost, J.; Aaron, L.; Donovan, K.; McKechnie, S.; Stanworth, S.; Drakesmith, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20092114v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum iron concentrations","low serum iron","iron parameters","Severe hypoferraemia","COVID","dysregulated iron homeostasis","severe hypoxaemia","patients consistent","critical iron-dependent processes","non-severe hypoxemia","increased serum ferritin","severe hypoxemic respiratory failure","profound hypoferraemia","Coronavirus disease","monitor disease","severity of disease","lymphocyte responses","lymphocyte count","multiorgan failure","receiver","oxygen utilisation","characteristic curves","micromol","COPD","hypoxia sensing","optimal Youden Index","immunity","linear regression","requiring ICU admission","poor outcomes","physiological changes","pathology","PaO2","FiO2","thromboinflammation","mortality","conclusion","simple biomarker","area","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear. Methods: We included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were investigated. Results: All were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 30-59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3\u002BT%, and CD8\u002BT% were found to be valuable in predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness.

Current microbiologic diagnostics often fail to identify etiologic pathogens, leading to diagnostic uncertainty and precluding the implementation of targeted therapies. To directly address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we undertook this study to evaluate the potential utility of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) approaches for detecting LRTI in the HCT population. METHODS We enrolled 22 post-HCT adults ages 19-69 years with acute respiratory illnesses who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the University of Michigan between January 2012 and May 2013. Unbiased mNGS was performed on BAL fluid to detect microbes and assess host response. Results were compared to those obtained by standard clinical microbiology testing. RESULTS Unbiased mNGS detected all microbes identified by standard testing (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus). Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis) and findings were confirmed by independent PCR testing. mNGS identified microbes of unlikely or uncertain pathogenicity in 10 patients with clinical evidence of non-infectious respiratory conditions. Patients with respiratory pathogens were found to have significantly increased expression of immunity related gene biomarkers relative to those without (p=0.022) as well as lower alpha diversity of their respiratory microbial communities (p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS Compared to conventional diagnostics, host/pathogen mNGS enhanced detection of microbial pathogens in BAL fluid from HCT patients. Furthermore, this approach simultaneously evaluated the association between identified microbes and the expression of innate immunity gene biomarkers.

The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID19. Objectives: Conduct a rapid review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters. Methods: A review of scientific literature was conducted covering the period between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Nineteen scientific papers were evaluated in detail from 27 papers that contained information on the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID19. Results: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.1 to 7.5 days, based on 22 estimates, and the median from 1.9 to 6.0 days (based on 7 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time. Discussion: The values of the estimates for serial interval and generation time are heavily influenced by the contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals. Mitigation measures that are introduced in a country or region are of paramount importance in this regard. The serial interval estimate of 6.6 days (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 19.0) from the paper by Cereda et al.[10] is likely to be the most relevant to European countries. National estimates should be obtained as soon as possible.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffin, J. M.; Collins, A. B.; Hunt, K.; McEvoy, D.; Casey, M.; Byrne, A. W.; McAloon, C.

We review evidence for the potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density and age structure). Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19.

Countries that have flattened their coronavirus curves prove that interventions can bring COVID-19 under control. These achievements hold lessons, such as the strict social distancing and coordinated efforts of all government levels in China and massive testing in South Korea, for other countries battling the coronavirus around the world. In this work, we attempt to estimate how many COVID-19 cases could have been prevented in the United States (US) when compared with the US\u0027s actual number of cases assuming that on a certain date, the US took China-like or South Korea-like interventions and that these interventions would have been as effective in the US as in China and South Korea. We found that if that date was at the early stage of the outbreak (March 10), more than 99% (1.15 million) fewer infected cases could be expected by the end of the epidemic. This number decreases to 66.03% and 73.06% fewer infected cases with the China-like scenario and the South Korea-like scenario, respectively, if actions were taken on April 1, highlighting the need to respond quickly and effectively to fight the virus. Furthermore, we found that although interventions in both China and South Korea allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to be managed, the epidemic could still oscillate without strict large-scale lockdown measures, as shown in South Korea. Our results demonstrate that early effective interventions can save considerably more people from infection and provide a worldwide alert regard the need for swift response.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, K.; Song, Y.; Li, M.; Shen, Z.; Wang, M.; Wu, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64d496c59f57f9d40e2d27fca33ea107799a4a71.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20092981v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","China","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["South Korea","China","COVID","early effective interventions","fewer infected cases","scenario","Countries","US\u0027s actual number of cases","outbreak","need","epidemic","strict large-scale lockdown measures","certain date","early stage","coronavirus curves","strict social distancing","coordinated efforts","government levels","massive testing","worldwide alert","country","people","swift response","governments\u0027 responses","infection","lessons","pandemic","results","disease","effects","spread","United States","end","achievements","actions","control","work"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We searched Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, Wanfang Data and CNKI from their inception to March 31, 2020. In addition, we searched related studies on COVID-19 published before March 31, 2020 through Google Scholar. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and synthesized the results using a qualitative synthesis. Results: Six studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies on SARS showed an overall risk of death of 7.2% to 20.0%. One study of SARS patients who used macrolides, quinolones or beta lactamases showed that the mean duration of hospital stay was 14.2, 13.8 and 16.2 days, respectively, and their average duration of fever was 14.3, 14.0 and 16.2 days, respectively. One cohort study on MERS indicated that macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-1.51, P = 0.56) and improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.47, -1.64], P = 0.68). According to the findings of 33 studies, the proportion of antibiotics use ranged from 19.4% to 100.0% in children and 13.2% to 100.0% in adults, despite the lack of etiological evidence. The most commonly used antibiotics in adults were quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides and in children meropenem and linezolid. Conclusions: The benefits of antibiotic agents for adults with SARS or MERS were questionable in the absence of bacterial coinfections. There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotic agents for children with COVID-19 in the absence of bacterial coinfection.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, J.; Tang, Y.; Ma, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Li, W.; Baskota, M.; Yang, Y.; Wang, X.; Li, Q.; Luo, X.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

Objective: To identify commonly-prescribed medications that may be associated with lesser risk of morbidity with COVID-19 across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using electronic health records between 7/1/2019 and 4/07/2020. Setting: Outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals presenting to a clinical site and undergoing COVID-19 testing. Main Outcome or Measure: Inpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 12,818 individuals with COVID-19 testing results available, 2271 (17.7%) were test-positive, and 707/2271 (31.1%) were hospitalized in one of 5 hospitals. Based on a comparison of ranked electronic prescribing frequencies, medications enriched among test-positive individuals not requiring hospitalization included ibuprofen, valacyclovir, and naproxen. Among individuals who were hospitalized, mechanical ventilation was documented in 213 (30.1%); ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring ventilation. Conclusions and Relevance: These preliminary findings suggest that electronic health records may be applied to identify medications associated with lower risk of morbidity with COVID-19, but larger cohorts will be required to address confounding by indication. Larger scale efforts at repositioning may help to identify FDA-approved medications meriting study for prevention of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro, Victor M; Ross, Rachel A; McBride, Sean MJ; Perlis, Roy H","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of COVID","prescribed medications","test-positive individuals","mechanical ventilation","electronic health records","Inpatient hospitalization","FDA-approved medications","lesser risk of morbidity","lower risk of morbidity","ibuprofen","community hospitals","testing","naproxen","Results","electronic prescribing frequencies","Larger scale efforts","Eastern Massachusetts hospitals","inpatient settings","documented requirement","rapid efforts","larger cohorts","academic medical centers","Measure","preliminary findings","emergency department","Outpatient","silico cohort","study","novel","repositioning","Main Outcome","established treatments","infectious coronavirus","clinical site","vaccine","Conclusions","Relevance","potential therapeutics","Design","comparison","valacyclovir","confounding","mortality","indication","Importance","Objective","Participants"],"language":"en"},

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 \u002Bve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA\u002Bve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB\u002BSARS-CoV-2: 6.5\u002B/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9\u002B/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB\u002BSARS-CoV-2: 3.4\u002B/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5\u002B/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yongyu; Bi, Lijun; Chen, Yu; Wang, Yaguo; Fleming, Joy; Yu, Yanhong; Gu, Ye; Liu, Chang; Fan, Lichao; Wang, Xiaodan; Cheng, Moxin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a92029e6e42de51a3b93e503d757e27b6909b991.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033795","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTB"],"locations":["China","Shenyang"],"keyphrases":["MTB infection status of COVID","MTB co-infection","MTB infection data","MTB infection rate","critical COVID","Comparison of MTB infection status","confirmed COVID","suspected COVID","pneumonia severity","critical cases","highest risk of severe COVID","moderate cases","days vs SARS-COV","rapid development of COVID","bacterial pneumonia","viral pneumonia patients","disease severity","ve cases","vs mild","rate of disease progression","larger study","vs diabetes","Shenyang Chest Hospital","coronary heart disease","observational case-control study","primary care hospitals","Multi-center study","IGRA","development of symptoms","symptom development","Risk factors","Mean age","Wuhan","range","participating primary-care hospitals","National Health Commission of China","co-morbidities","active TB increase susceptibility","laboratory data","hospital admission","lead","Measures","demographic","Treatment Guidelines","Diagnostic","Interferon-gamma Release Assays","hypertension","v6","peripheral blood","Relevance","Main Outcome","Setting","Design","RT-PCR assay","years","pathogen","validation","Importance","Results","tuberculosis","Conclusions","Exposures","Comparisons","complications","Hubei connection","global population","clarification","medical resources","Final date of follow-up","COPD","Participants","gender ratio","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The high prevalence and associated healthcare, social and economic challenges of COVID-19 suggest this pandemic is likely to have a major impact on cancer management, and has been shown to potentially have worse outcomes in this cohort of vulnerable patients (1). This study aims to compare the outcomes of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Method: We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in four different North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. All clinically relevant outcomes were then compared to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (12th March- 7th April 2020). Results: A total of 52 electronic patient records during the study time period were reviewed. Cohort A (median age 76 years, 56% males) and cohort B (median age 58 years, 62% male) comprised of 26 patients each. With the exclusion of cancer, both had a median of 2 comorbidities. Within cohort A, the most frequent underlying cancer was colorectal (5/26) and prostate cancer (5/26), and 77% of patients in Cohort A had received previous anti-cancer therapy. The most common presenting symptoms were cough and pyrexia in both cohorts. Frequent laboratory findings included lymphopenia, anaemia and elevated CRP in both cohorts, whilst hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia was predominantly seen amongst patients with cancer. Median duration of admission was 7 days in both cohorts. The mortality rate was the same in both cohorts (23%), with median age of mortality of 80 years. Of cancer patients who died, all were advanced stage, had been treated with palliative intent and had received anti-cancer therapy within 13 days of admission. Conclusion: Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. Whilst extra caution is warranted in the administration of anti-cancer therapies pertaining to the risk of immune-suppression, this data does not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joharatnam-Hogan, Nalinie; Hochhauser, Daniel; Shiu, Kai-Keen; Rush, Hannah; Crolley, Valerie; Butcher, Emma; Sharma, Anand; Muhammad, Aun; Vasdev, Nikhil; Anwar, Muhammad; Kantser, Ganna; Saha, Aramita; Raja, Fharat; Bridgewater, John; Khan, Khurum","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20061127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North London"],"keyphrases":["history of cancer","cancer management","prostate cancer","exclusion of cancer","positive patients","RT-PCR positive cancer patients","cohort of vulnerable patients","frequent underlying cancer","outcome of patients","non-cancer counterparts","outcomes of COVID","previous anti-cancer therapy","administration of anti-cancer therapies","late stage of cancer diagnosis","cohort B","median age of mortality","cohorts","years","worse outcomes","positive disease","relevant outcomes","economic challenges of COVID","Median duration of admission","Old age","days of admission","study time period","mortality rate","pandemic","outcomes of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","associated healthcare","risk of immune","higher risk","advanced stage","included morbidity","Frequent laboratory findings","novel coronavirus disease","national healthcare systems","anaemia","multiple co-morbidities","lymphopenia","electronic patient records","known case","potential","elevated CRP","radiological characteristics","males","different North London hospitals","major impact","total","data","high prevalence","pyrexia","hypokalaemia","Conclusion","palliative intent","length of hospital","primary centre","common presenting symptoms","months","suppression","hypoalbuminaemia","hypoproteinaemia","Background","extra caution","Results","outbreak","Method","comorbidities"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Update of a Cochrane review that included a meta-analysis of observational studies during the SARS outbreak of 2003. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous review; search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from October 2010 up to 1 April 2020; and forward and backward citation analysis. DATA SELECTION: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials of people of any age, testing the use of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing against standard practice, or a similar physical barrier. Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random-effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms were poorly reported and limited to discomfort with lower compliance. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases, but increased risk of quarantined workers contracting influenza. All trials were conducted during seasonal ILI activity. CONCLUSIONS: Most included trials had poor design, reporting and sparse events. There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers without other measures. We found insufficient evidence for a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators and limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic included in the previous version of our Cochrane review we recommend the use of masks combined with other measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jefferson, Tom; Jones, Mark; Al Ansari, Lubna A; Bawazeer, Ghada; Beller, Elaine; Clark, Justin; Conly, John; Del Mar, Chris; Dooley, Elisabeth; Ferroni, Eliana; Glasziou, Paul; Hoffman, Tammy; Thorning, Sarah; Van Driel, Mieke","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["included trials","use of masks","face masks","surgical masks","risk ratios","risk of bias","effect of masks","Eligible trials","ILI cases","increased risk of quarantined workers","Cochrane review","cluster-randomised trials of people","healthcare workers","previous review","observational evidence","reduction of influenza","use of eye protection","limited evidence","insufficient evidence","search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","effectiveness of eye protection","Cochrane tool","trial testing quarantining workers","DATA SELECTION","DATA SOURCES","DATA EXTRACTION","household ILI contacts","seasonal ILI activity","N95 respirators","previous SARS epidemic","previous version","person distancing","difference","general population","effectiveness of quarantine","reported results","measures","meta-analysis of observational studies","acute respiratory illness","use of facial barriers","backward citation analysis","poor design","SARS outbreak","spread of respiratory viruses","pooling","random-effects model","PubMed","standard practice","recommendation","interrupting","authors","age","generalised inverse variance method","related consequences","Embase","Confidence Intervals","similar physical barrier","sparse events","Outcomes","CINAHL","Update","CONCLUSIONS","discomfort","lower compliance","Abstract OBJECTIVE","Harms"],"language":"en"},

An exhaustive statistical analysis encompassing arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means, standard deviation, skewness, variance, Pearson and Spearman correlation was derived from the data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people was obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The prediction shows that Turkey may register in the near future approximately more than 6000 new infections in a day as worst case scenario; and less than 300 cases in the perfect scenario. However, the country could register in the near future a daily number of 27000 people recovered from COVID-19 in the perfect scenario; and less than 5000 people in a worst scenario. Moreover, Turkey in a worst-case scenario could record a high number of approximately 200 deaths per day; and less than 150 deaths in a perfect scenario. Similarly, in the case of South Africa, the prediction results show that in the near future the country could register about 500 new infected cases daily and more than 25 deaths in the worst scenario; while in a perfect scenario less than 50 new infected and zero death cases could be recorded. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation. A new mathematical model COVID-19 comprised of nine classes was suggested; of which a formula of the reproductive number, well-poseness of the solutions and the stability analysis were presented in details. The suggested model was further extended to the scope of nonlocal operators for each case; whereby the Atangana-Seda numerical method was used to provide numerical solutions, and simulations were performed for different non-integer numbers.

While vaccination remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention, common measures practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing, the use of protective face masks, and frequent hand washing are rarely utilized during flu season. In this investigation, we examined the effect of these preventative measures in decreasing influenza burden this year. We examined three countries with major COVID-19 outbreaks i.e. China, Italy and the United States, and compared the flu activity this year to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019). We found that this year in China and Italy, there was a significantly steeper decline of flu cases than average, which correlated with an increase in positive COVID-19 case reports in those countries. These \u0022averted\u0022 cases can be translated into a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality. As such, we conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that behavioral measures can decrease the burden of communicable respiratory infections, and these measures should be adopted to an extent during normal influenza season.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Young, G.

The primary aim of this review is to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for the virus in their stool. Data were extracted concerning the nature of the test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and any evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining these results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA in these studies were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after nasopharyngeal swab turned negative with one result remaining positive after 47 days of onset of symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the proportion of cases potentially transmitted through infection via faecally shed virus. Conclusions There is a relatively high rate of positive tests and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in faecal samples of selected patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to demonstrate how much these positive tests correlate with viable virus and transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications for duration of isolation, precautions recommended in individuals undertaking a period of isolation, protective equipment for health professionals and interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Sunnia; Parker, Jody; Smits, Stephanie; Underwood, Jonathan; Dolwani, Sunil","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f5e6026c5f4241d0636dfd05e0c230f65d58021.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069526v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of positive faecal tests","timing of positive faecal samples","viable virus","evidence of viable faecal virus","timing of positive samples","COVID","faecal RNA","faecal samples of selected patients","high rate of positive tests","faecally shed virus","faeco-oral route","Duration of faecal viral shedding","possible faeco-oral transmission route","SARS-CoV","duration of isolation","studies","Results","negative nasopharyngeal swabs","period of isolation","insufficient evidence","firm conclusions","gastrointestinal complaints","gastrointestinal tract","respiratory symptoms","days of onset","systematic literature review","interventional procedures","protective equipment","health professionals","persistence","precautions","infection","number","proportion of cases","individuals","addition","important implications","nature","Methods","Background","relevant articles","primary aim","Data","stool","research"],"language":"en"},

Creating models to describe and quantify alternative mitigation strategies becomes increasingly urgent. Methods: In this study, we propose an agent-based model of disease transmission in a society divided into closely connected families, workplaces, and social groups. This allows us to discuss mitigation strategies, including targeted quarantine measures. Results: We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost-benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown of workplaces. Conclusions: A targeted quarantine strategy is quite efficient with only 5 days of quarantine, and its relative effect increases when supplemented with other measures that reduce disease transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eilersen, Andreas; Sneppen, Kim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b72e843b66eeb54b85568d509994443b5dac047e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targeted quarantine strategy","targeted quarantine measures","days of quarantine","disease spread","quarantining contacts","long lockdown of workplaces","effective lockdown","alternative mitigation strategies","society","diffuse social contacts","agent-based model of disease transmission","social groups","terms of lost workdays","tracing","families","COVID","unprecedented situation","relative effect","Conclusions","international community","short duration","cost-benefit","Background","households","pandemic","study","models","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Analytical risk assessment is a valuable approach to guide decision-making on travel restrictions and border measures during the early phase of an outbreak, when transmission is primarily contained within a source country. Here we introduce a modular framework for estimating the importation risk of an emerging disease when the direct travel route is restricted and the risk stems from indirect importation via intermediary countries. This was the situation for Australia in February 2020. The framework was specifically developed to assess the importation risk of COVID-19 into Australia during the early stages of the outbreak from late January to mid-February 2020. The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. However, with travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China into Australia via potential intermediary countries in the Asia Pacific region. The framework was successfully used to contribute to the evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions in the Australian context during the early phase of COVID-19 emergence and is adaptable to other contexts for future outbreak response.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shearer, Freya; Walker, James; Tellioglu, Nefel; McCaw, James M; McVernon, Jodie; Black, Andrew; Geard, Nicholas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be90c11bdf2ac3769dd3ceb222bb8906c44188aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20057257","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Asia Pacific","Australia"],"keyphrases":["importation risk of COVID","dominant importation risk","risk stems","early stages","indirect importation","emerging disease outbreak","early phase of COVID","Analytical risk assessment","travel restrictions","modular framework","border measures","mainland China","future outbreak response","critical decisions","potential intermediary countries","direct travel route","uncontained transmission","source country","valuable approach","guide decision-making","case definitions","Australian context","contexts","emergence","governments","Asia Pacific region","evidence base","time of analysis","limited data","situation"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 patients manifested as lung injury with complications in other organs, such as liver, heart, gastrointestinal tract, especially for severe cases. However, whether COVID-19 causes significant acute kidney injury (AKI) remained controversial. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, urine and blood routine tests and other laboratory parameters of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Union Hospital. Findings: 178 patients, admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were included in this study. No patient (0 [0%]) presented increased serum creatinine (Scr), and 5 (2.8%) patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating few cases with kidney dysfunction. However, for patients (83) with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization, 45 (54.2%) patients displayed abnormality in urinalysis, such as proteinuria, hematuria and leukocyturia, while none of the patients was recorded to have acute kidney injury (AKI) throughout the study. Meanwhile, the patients with abnormal urinalysis usually had worse disease progression reflecting by laboratory parameters presentations, including markers of liver injury, inflammation, and coagulation. Conclusion: Many patients manifested by abnormal urinalysis on admission, including proteinuria or hematuria.

ACE2 was significantly (p\u003C0.001) overexpressed in conjunctival cells obtained from subjects with conjunctivitis, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival papilloma, conjunctival cyst, and conjunctival polyps epithelial cells when compared to that in conjunctival epithelial cells obtained from control subjects. Collectively, clinical features of reported COVID-19 patients combined with our results indicate that COVID-19 is likely to be transmitted through the conjunctiva.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"li, s.; li, d.; fang, j.; liu, q.; sun, x.; xu, g.; cao, w.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d994ad8573eb0126a0cfbcceb574eab9691ee496.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.21.20109652v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conjunctival cells","conjunctival cyst","conjunctival papilloma","conjunctival nevi","conjunctival epithelial cells","conjunctival polyps epithelial cells","Human conjunctival tissues","control subjects","normal subjects","Expression of ACE2","conjunctivitis","virus","clinical features of reported COVID","major outbreaks","major cellular-entry receptor","reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction","immunofluorescence","western blot assay","immunohistochemistry","ocular traumas","patients","results","organs"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide and pose a major public health burden. There is increasing evidence that men are more likely to die from SARS-CoV-2 infection than women. However, underlying factors that mediate the observed sex bias in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown. Methods. In this retrospective cohort, we included COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. We obtained demographic data of all patients who were discharged or had died by 29th April 2020. We systematically analyzed sex hormones as well as cytokine and chemokine responses in male and female patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections upon hospital admission. We used uni- and multivariable linear regression methods to identify potential risk factors for disease severity in males and females. Findings. All enrolled patients (n=45; n=35 males and n=10 females) presented comorbidities with hypertension being the most common (45.7% in males; 40% in females), followed by cancer (35% in males; 40% in females), obesity (34.3% in males and 30% in females), type II diabetes (25.7% in males and 20% in females) and chronic heart diseases (8.6% in males and 0% in females). We detected that the vast majority of male COVID-19 patients present low testosterone (68.6%) and low dihydrotestosterone (48.6%) levels. In contrast, most female COVID-19 patients have elevated testosterone levels (60%) without alterations in dihydrotestosterone levels. Both, female and male COVID-19 patients may present elevated estradiol levels (45.7% in males and 40% in females). Disease severity defined by SOFA score correlates with elevated cytokine responses (e.g. IL-6) in males and IL-2 in females. In male COVID-19 patients, testosterone levels negatively correlate with inflammatory IL-2 and IFN-{gamma}, whereas estradiol levels positively correlate with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Vice versa, in female COVID-19 patients, testosterone levels positively correlate with inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6). Interpretation. We here show that critically ill male COVID-19 patients suffer from severe testosterone and dihydrotestosterone deficiencies. Both androgens are required to mount antiviral immune responses to combat infection in males.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schroeder, M.; Tuku, B.; Jarczak, D.; Nierhaus, A.; Bai, T.; Jacobsen, H.; Zickler, M.; Mueller, Z.; Stanelle-Bertram, S.; Meinhardt, A.; Aberle, J.; Kluge, S.; Gabriel, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e64a0d4d06fbb39413af8d4801233852ad26b9d4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20073817v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOFA"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["females","female patients","female COVID","enrolled patients","elevated testosterone levels","dihydrotestosterone levels","ill male COVID","elevated estradiol levels","inflammatory IL","vast majority of male COVID","inflammatory cytokine IL","severe testosterone","low testosterone","elevated cytokine responses","SARS-CoV","coronavirus disease","disease severity","low dihydrotestosterone","chemokine responses","inflammatory cytokines","dihydrotestosterone deficiencies","antiviral immune responses","underlying factors","hospital admission","sex hormones","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","potential risk factors","observed sex bias","University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf","multivariable linear regression methods","SOFA score correlates","Intensive Care Unit","laboratory","Germany","infections","comorbidities","chronic heart diseases","major public health burden","hypertension","gamma","IFN","diabetes","alterations","evidence","androgens","women","retrospective cohort","type","demographic data","contrast","cancer","obesity","Background","Findings","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with a high level of education (48.86% bachelor degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government. About 94% of the respondents identified contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). Regular hand washing and social distancing were selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soups as preventive measures against COVID-19. The majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly, and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) is the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19.

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social-distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, and contact-tracing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to build the community herd immunity needed to effectively control and eliminate the pandemic. This study is based on the design and use of a mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19. An analytical expression for the minimum number of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with mortality data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Florida, as well as for the entire US, show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, the minimum herd immunity threshold for the entire US, state of New York and state of Florida are, respectively, 90%, 84% and 85%. Furthermore, it was shown that, while a significantly large increase in vaccination rate (from baseline) is necessarily needed to eliminate COVID-19 from the entire US, the pandemic can be eliminated from the states of New York and Florida if the vaccination rate is marginally increased (by as low as 10%) from its baseline value. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US or in the two states of New York and Florida is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with a public mask use program or an effective social-distancing measure. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold. Finally, it is shown that the vaccination program is more likely to lead to COVID-19 elimination in the state of Florida, followed by the state of New York and then the entire US.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gumel, A.

The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Findings. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd March; one further sample was reactive in an anti-spike ELISA. Interpretation. Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to 2-3 weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. Finally, it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals seroconvert and become reactive in the assays used. Serial follow up studies are needed to track infection and seroconversion in this and other similar populations However, these data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Craig; Grayson, Nicholas; Paton, Robert; Louren\u00E7o, Jos\u00E9; Penman, Bridget; Lee, Lian Ni; Odon, Valerie; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Chinnakannan, Senthil; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Edmans, Matthew; Fyfe, Alexander; Imlach, Carol; Kooblall, Kreepa; Lim, Nicholas; Liu, Chang; Lopez-Camacho, Cesar; McInally, Carol-Anne; Ramamurthy, Narayan; Ratcliff, Jeremy; Supasa, Piyada; Wang, Beibei; Mentzer, Alexander J; Turner, Marc; Semple, Calum; Baillie, John Kenneth; Harvala, Heli; Screaton, Gavin; Temperton, Nigel; Klenerman, Paul; Jarvis, Lisa; Gupta, Sunetra; Simmonds, Peter","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d0a20254f994dcc6c392557e9566bd47f50725a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20060467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","UK"],"locations":["Scotland"],"keyphrases":["pseudotyped SARS-CoV","current SARS-CoV","SARS coronavirus","Scotland","samples","serological study of recent blood donors","blood banks","neutralising antibodies","virus microneutralisation assay","epidemic","diagnosed infections","seroconversion","study group","history of recent respiratory infections","symptomatic individuals","proportion of infected individuals","marker of past infection","contemporary seroprevalence","time period","associated deaths","data","numbers seropositive","useful tool","emergence","growth rate","progression","sero-surveys","frequency","anti-spike ELISA","general population","similar populations","outbreak","rise","studies","extent","UK","Serial","assays","Controls","Background","Methods","Findings","Interpretation","weeks"],"language":"en"},

We constructed a fully Bayesian latent variable model for integrative clustering of six data categories, including demographic information, symptoms, original comorbidities, vital signs, blood routine tests and inflammatory marker measurements. We identified four prognostic types of COVID-19 in intensive care patients, presenting a stepwise distribution in age, respiratory condition and inflammatory markers, suggesting the prognostic efficacy of these indicators. This report, to our knowledge, is the first attempt of dealing with classification of COVID-19 in intensive care patients.

Abstract Introduction: The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has required adaptation by hospitals affected by the pandemic, which has caused a reduction in elective surgical activity. Material and method: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale (BRCSS), the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (p \u003C0.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martino, Marcello Di; Septiem, Javier Garc\u00EDa; Gonz\u00E1lez, Roc\u00EDo Maqueda; de Nova, Jose Luis Mu\u00F1oz; de la Hoz Rodr\u00EDguez, \u00C1ngela; Bonito, Alba Correa; Mart\u00EDn-P\u00E9rez, Elena","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2806abcfcda76ad3e89a2e72302c8e0b5e94d01a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009739X20301664; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009739X20301664?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Estudio","Resultados","De los"],"organizations":["Hubo"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infecci\u00F3n por COVID","contagio por COVID","y en","Brescia Respiratory COVID","severity of respiratory infection","Los pacientes sometidos","los casos","por patolog\u00EDa benigna y","infection rate","rate of infection","severe respiratory infection","los hospitales afectados por","infecci\u00F3n por SARS-CoV","los cuales","high rates of COVID","elective surgical activity","elective group","Cinco pacientes presentaron una infecci\u00F3n respiratoria","sobre todo en los pacientes oncol\u00F3gicos","elective operations","oncological diseases","Material y m\u00E9todo","elective surgery group","seguridad y optimizaci\u00F3n","mes previo y","los recursos disponibles","infecci\u00F3n respiratoria seg\u00FAn","surgical procedures","cirug\u00EDa presentaron una elevada tasa","forma programada por patolog\u00EDa tumoral","actividad quir\u00FArgica debe basarse en una priorizaci\u00F3n","causando una reducci\u00F3n","pacientes operados durante","actividad quir\u00FArgica electiva","Retrospective study of patients","se produjo una reducci\u00F3n progresiva","estaban afectos por enfermedad oncol\u00F3gica","medidas terap\u00E9uticas adoptadas y","Severity Scale","cirug\u00EDa electiva","cirug\u00EDa urgente","benign diseases","puesta en marcha","urgent surgery group","Local resumption of surgical activity","pandemia","grupo","Se analiz\u00F3","urgent procedures","forma urgente","pandemic","cases","total","complicaciones postoperatorias globales","overall postoperative complications","resultaron afectos","progressive decrease","progressive increase","operar","respetando unas premisas","Estudio retrospectivo","adopted therapeutic measures","adaptaci\u00F3n","BRCSS","marzo","ha requerido","aumento progresivo","optimisation","pico","progresi\u00F3n","expansi\u00F3n","gravedad","todos debidos","intervini\u00E9ndose \u00FAnicamente","exitus","spread","method","Conclusiones","reduction","certain premises of security","febrero hasta","Desde","available resources","peak","previous month","adaptation","Abstract Introduction","Resume Introducci\u00F3n","Resultados","hospitals","prioritisation","Conclusions","worsening","Hubo","Results","deaths"],"language":"en"},

We investigate the potential effects of a combination of measures such as continuation of hygienic constraints after leaving lockdown, isolation of infectious persons, repeated and adaptive short-term contact reductions and also large-scale use of antibody tests in order to know who can be assumed to be immune and participate at public life without constraints. We apply two commonly used modeling approaches: extended SEIR models formulated both as System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation, in order to get insight into the disease dynamics of a complete country like Germany and also into more detailed behavior of smaller regions. We confirm the findings of other models that without intervention the consequences of the pandemic can be catastrophic and we extend such findings with effective strategies to overcome the challenge.

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase \u2162 and 4 trials were phrase \u2163. The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients (\u2265 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future.

It is important to think about the medical approach to dealing with patients with multimorbidity in order to maximize the quality of the services provided by national health services, and thus to secure a better quality of life for these patients. Information about the time spent in a medical consultation with a patient with MM criteria is essential to better organize and deliver healthcare. As far as we know, no previous review has summarized the data relating to how having MM affects the length of the average consultation time. Objective: To review all the experimental observational studies that describe the impact of having MM on the average time of a medical consultation. Methods: This systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The systematic online searches of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018. The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria. (Kappa=0.84 and Kappa=0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined - the length of medical appointments with patients with MM criteria. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The comparator used was the length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM criteria. Experimental and observational studies were included. Results: Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included. The study shows that there is a clear trend for patients with MM criteria to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria (p\u003C0.001). The global quality of this study was considered Satisfactory. Conclusions: It is imperative to study the consultation time spent on patients with MM criteria. Finding a longer consultation time indicates it is important to rethink and adapt GPs lists and time planning to be able to give better medical care to patients with MM by providing agendas that have specific times set aside for these patients and allocating enough time for every task required.","publish_time":"2019-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tadeu, A.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show a wide range of symptoms and disease severity, while limited data is available on its immunogenicity. Here, the kinetics of the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in relation to clinical features and dynamics of specific B-cell populations are reported. Immunophenotyping of B cells was performed by flow cytometry with longitudinally collected PBMCs. In parallel, serum samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies using whole proteome peptide microarrays. Soon after disease onset in a mild case, we observed an increased frequency of plasmablasts concomitantly with a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response. In contrast, a case with more severe progression showed a delayed, but eventually very strong and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response. This case study shows that determining SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody epitopes can be valuable to monitor the specificity and magnitude of the early B-cell response, which could guide the development of vaccine candidates.

Accurately identifying subgroups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high- and low-risk for complications would assist in directing resources. Objective: To validate the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a predictive model implemented in over 100 U.S. hospitals that has been recently promoted for use in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to non-ICU level care at a large academic medical center from March 9 through April 7, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite adverse outcome of ICU-level care, mechanical ventilation, or death during the hospitalization. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI (range 0-100) to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. We evaluated model discrimination and calibration using both raw EDI scores and their slopes. Results: Among 174 COVID-19 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 61 (35%) experienced the composite outcome. Area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the EDI was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.84). Patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 64.8 made up 17% of the study cohort and had an 80% probability of experiencing the outcome during their hospitalization with a median lead time of 28 hours from when the threshold was first exceeded to the outcome. Employing the EDI slope lowered the AUCs to 0.68 (95% CI 0.60-0.77) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.75) for slopes calculated over 4 and 8 hours, respectively. In a subset of 109 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours and who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) patients who never exceeded an EDI of 37.9 had a 93% probability of not experiencing the outcome throughout the rest of their hospitalization, suggesting low risk. Conclusion: In this validation study, we found the EDI identifies small subsets of high- and low-risk patients with fair discrimination. These findings highlight the need for hospitals to carefully evaluate prediction models before widespread operational use among COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, K.; Valley, T.

This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%).

Despite the biological significance of microbe-host interactions, there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes. Computational methods are expected to fill this gap by generating, integrating and prioritizing predictions - as experimental detection remains challenging due to feasibility issues. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins together with host molecular networks. Using the concept of network diffusion, MicrobioLink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression. We demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study. We used gut metaproteomic data from Crohn\u2019s disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis.

Method: From a meta-analysis of external quality assessments of RT-PCR assays of RNA viruses, we derived a conservative estimate of the range of false positive rates that can reasonably be expected in SARS-CoV-2 testing, and analyzed the effect of such rates on analyses of regional test data and estimates of population prevalence and asymptomatic ratio. Findings: Review of external quality assessments revealed false positive rates of 0-16.7%, with an interquartile range of 0.8-4.0%. Such rates would have large impacts on test data when prevalence is low. Inclusion of such rates significantly alters four published analyses of population prevalence and asymptomatic ratio. Interpretation: The high false discovery rate that results, when prevalence is low, from false positive rates typical of RT-PCR assays of RNA viruses raises questions about the usefulness of mass testing; and indicates that across a broad range of likely prevalences, positive test results are more likely to be wrong than are negative results, contrary to public health advice about SARS-CoV-2 testing. There are myriad clinical and case management implications. Failure to appreciate the potential frequency of false positives and the consequent unreliability of positive test results across a range of scenarios could unnecessarily remove critical workers from service, expose uninfected individuals to greater risk of infection, delay or impede appropriate medical treatment, lead to inappropriate treatment, degrade patient care, waste personal protective equipment, waste human resources in unnecessary contact tracing, hinder the development of clinical improvements, and weaken clinical trials.

In this paper, we conduct an analytical game-theoretical study to examine the effects of supply capacity disruption timing on pricing decisions for substitute products in a two-supplier one-retailer supply chain setting. We investigate whether the timing of disruption may significantly impact the optimal pricing strategy of the retailer. We derive the optimal pricing strategy and ordering levels with both disruption timing and product substitution. By exploring both the Nash and Stackelberg games, we find that the order quantity with the disrupted supplier depends on price leadership and it tends to increase when the non-disrupted supplier is the leader. Moreover, the equilibrium market retail prices are higher under higher levels of disruption for the Nash game, compared to the Stackelberg game. We also uncover that the non-disruptive supplier can always charge the highest wholesale price if the disruption occurs before orders are received. This highlights the critical role of order timing. The insights can help operations managers to proper design risk mitigation ordering strategies and re-design the supply contracts in the presence of product substitution under supply disruptions.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Varun; Ivanov, Dmitry; Choi, TsanMing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/964858922f20d4a44a8d76aa626df30d120ab3a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305048319313155; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048319313155?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["timing of disruption","supply disruptions","effects of supply capacity disruption timing","higher levels of disruption","supply contracts","pricing decisions","supplier competition","non-disrupted supplier","optimal pricing strategy","non-disruptive supplier","Nash game","retailer supply chain setting","ordering levels","critical role of order timing","presence of product substitution","re-design","sourcing decisions","analytical game-theoretical study","order quantity","price leadership","Stackelberg games","proper design risk mitigation ordering strategies","highest wholesale price","operations managers","equilibrium market retail prices","substitute products","insights","paper","orders","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We did a cross-sectional point prevalence survey, which was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We included a pre-determined number of centers based on each country population: five to ten EDs for countries with \u003E 20 million inhabitants and one to five EDs for the other countries. ED directors or named delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice in use one month after the outbreak in Northern Italy. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results: Overall 102 centers from 18 countries completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. Conclusion: We identified variability and gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. Early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as key factors that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bressan, S.; Buonsenso, D.; Farrugia, R.; Parri, N.; Oostenbrink, R.; Titomanlio, L.; Roland, D.; Nijman, R.; Maconochie, I.; Da Dalt, L.; Mintegi, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e2a4b86d7a598e657d7a86149a95459db495ea6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20075481v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["PPE","ED"],"locations":["United Kingdom","Europe"],"keyphrases":["appropriate use of PPE","PPE items","COVID","preparedness","countries","recommended PPE use","European referral EDs","children","pre-determined number of centers","ED directors","appropriate isolation facilities","documented contingency plan","positive ED staff","pre-triage","cross-sectional point prevalence survey","future pandemics","negative pressure isolation rooms","provision of simulation training","REPEM","epidemic","pediatric emergency medicine research networks","month","United Kingdom","outbreak","Early availability","key factors","variability","gaps","patient assessment","country population","Ireland","PERUKI","Northern Italy","responses","Wide variation","delegates","shortage","descriptive statistics","data","Methods","Conclusion","practice","inhabitants","Study objective","simulations","events","Results"],"language":"en"},

Objectives The aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test. Study design The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient. Results Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%). Conclusion Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hogan, Catherine A.; Garamani, Natasha; Lee, Andrew S.; Tung, Jack K.; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Huang, ChunHong; Stevens, Bryan; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79514ecc2f30b0f600f61608fb43d92464e58a32.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.092379","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","FDA","POC","Stanford Health Care EUA","NPA","PPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Accula test","Accula POC test calls","Accula SARS-CoV","POC test need","negative percent agreement","overall percent agreement","positive percent agreement","positive agreement","thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics","excellent negative agreement","diagnosis of SARS","SHC-LDT","low viral load burden","high pre-test probability of SARS","false negative rate","NPA","study","results","Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient","optimal use","Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory","emergency use authorization","nasopharyngeal swab samples","clinical settings","individuals","molecular tests","confirmatory testing","median cycle threshold value","Mesa Biotech","Food","FDA","Drug Administration","envelope","Assay concordance","assays","gene","Objectives","aim","confidence interval","point","specimens","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days.

In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. The susceptible and exposed (pre-symptomatic and infectious) individuals are allowed to travel between localities undetected. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre-symptomatic individuals. We associate the behavior change at the disease-importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Our results show that restricting mobility is valuable if the importing locality is increasing its level of preparedness with respect to the outbreak size at the origin. Moreover, increased levels of preparedness can yield lower total outbreak size by further reducing the outbreak size at the importing locality, even when the response at the origin is weak. Our results highlight that public health decisions on social distancing at localities with less severe outbreaks should strongly account for potential impact of neighbouring localities with a poor response to the outbreak rather than localities with successful responses.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eksin, C.; Ndeffo-Mbah, M.; Weitz, J.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prem, Kiesha; Liu, Yang; Russell, Tim; Kucharski, Adam J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Davies, Nicholas; Jit, Mark; Klepac, Petra","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02c71e88f7f7b9a187408f181858e919402730f5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["effects of control measures","epidemic size","unprecedented measures","city of Wuhan","peak","modelled effects of social distancing measures","latest estimates of epidemic parameters","age-structured epidemic framework","duration of infectiousness","underlying outbreak","China","estimates of R0","exported cases","mixing patterns","age-distribution","population","transmission model","data","efforts","role school children","large uncertainties","different stages","analysis","CoV","response","probability","novel strain of SARS","FINDINGS","Changes","INTERPRETATION","Restrictions","activities","way","height","people","limitations","number of infections","terms","reduction","lifting","progression","interquartile range","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain.

Using multi-time point whole blood (cellular/acellular) total transcriptomics in 27 patients, we highlight the promise of simultaneously mapping viral/bacterial load, cell composition, tissue damage biomarkers, balance between syndromic biology vs. environmental response, and unique biological insights in each patient using a single platform measurement. Integration of a transcriptome workflow yielded unexpected insights into the complex interplay between host genetics and viral/bacterial specific mechanisms, highlighted by a unique case of virally induced genetics (VIG) within one of these 27 patients. The power of RNAseq to study unique patient biology while investigating environmental contributions can be a critical tool moving forward for translational sciences applied to precision medicine.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prokop, J.

ABSTRACT COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was described in China in late 2019. There are currently more than three million diagnosed cases, constituting a pandemic which has caused a worldwide crisis. The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high. The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection. Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19. The Spanish Working Group on Crohn\u0027s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU) and the Spanish Nurses Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (GETEII) have prepared this document as a practical response to some common questions about the treatment of these patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mar\u00EDn-Jim\u00E9nez, Ignacio; Zabana, Yamile; Rodr\u00EDguez-Lago, Iago; Mar\u00EDn, Laura; Acosta, Manuel Barreiro-de; Esteve, Mar\u00EDa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b28ff5a629b5b6a899793c48e5a2ea996603067c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210570520301382; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210570520301382?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Grupo Enfermero de Trabajo"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel","The devastating effects of","control the inflammatory activity may modify the","the treatments used","course of COVID","and the Spanish Nurses Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease","risk of infection","The Spanish Working Group on Crohn\u0027s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis","some common questions about the treatment of these patients","of special interest","which may","in absolute","which was described in China in","ABSTRACT COVID","for severe forms and mortality","GETECCU","GETEII","coronavirus SARS","infecci\u00F3n","pacientes","constituting a pandemic which","enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal","caused a worldwide crisis","Grupo Enfermero de Trabajo","its highly contagious nature and although mild forms","as these patients have higher attendance at health","have prepared","document as","Colitis Ulcerosa","Enfermedad de Crohn","casos graves","actividad inflamatoria","Grupo Espa\u00F1ol","China a finales","caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","millones de casos diagnosticados","crisis a nivel mundial","due","than three million diagnosed cases","currently","s\u00EDndrome respiratorio agudo grave producido","very high","dudas frecuentes","mortalidad","colaboraci\u00F3n","forma pr\u00E1ctica","valores absolutos","objetivo","There","especial inter\u00E9s","Furthermore","mayor frecuentaci\u00F3n de centros sanitarios","formas leves","situaci\u00F3n de pandemia","caracter\u00EDsticas","evoluci\u00F3n","alta contagiosidad","efecto devastador","informaci\u00F3n","documento","riesgo de contagio","tratamientos","RESUMEN"],"language":"es"},

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked cou-pling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, in-fected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during in-cubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numer-ical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stim-ulated by using the real-data from 23 January to 18 - m March, 2020 where m is equal to the number of predic-tion days. Compared with integer-order system ( = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case with-out network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and unique-ness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic re-production number R0 is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymp-totically stable when R0 [\u2264] 1, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Z.; Yu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Ren, G.; Xu, C.; Lu, S.; Yin, Z.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68ea7de2ec2cce22aaa713a4ee16716ec4a72ef0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20079806v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["proposed system","proposed model","inter-city network system","fractional-order model","integer-order system","fraction-order model","fractional-order SEIHDR system","city closure","real-data","mathematical model","hospitalized individuals","inter-city networked cou-pling effects","number of predic","China","Wuhan","types of individuals","infectivity of individuals","cities","dynamic behavior of COVID","paper","basic re-production number R0","peak number of confirmed people","significant case","better fitting","predictor-correctors scheme","Beijing","numer-ical solutions","bounded solution","disease-free equilibrium point","asymp-totically stable","mortality rates","absence","initial condition","unique-ness","squares method","lock","Huanggang","Shanghai","results","threshold","tion days","cubation","quarantine measures","existence","Italy","pandemic","novel coronavirus","theoretical basis","end","account","future","impact","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Here, taking an empirical approach, we report a 20-30 day lag between the peak of confirmed to recovered cases and the peak of daily deaths in each country, independent of the epoch of that country in its pandemic cycle. This analysis is expected to be largely independent of the proportion of the population being tested and therefore should aid in planning around the timing and easing of public health measures. Our data also suggests broad predictions for the number of fatalities, generally somewhat lower than most other models.

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kujawski, Stephanie A.; Wong, Karen K; Collins, Jennifer P.; Epstein, Lauren; Killerby, Marie E.; Midgley, Claire M.; Abedi, Glen R.; Ahmed, N.

Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zipfel, Casey M; Bansal, Shweta","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af5d562d78a7441932170a3c39b5eaea7e75e016.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047993","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["influenza season deviates","Typical influenza seasons","prior influenza seasons","influenza sentinel surveillance data","decrease","undetected COVID","risk perception","ILI season","pre-holiday peak","pre-holiday wave","main post-holiday peak","transmission reduction","lower main epidemic peak","expected burden","illness data","average reduction","surveillance streams of co-circulating infections","small herald wave","mechanistic metapopulation model","spatiotemporal regression model","increased isolation","holidays","expectations","unexpected trends","multiple hypothesized drivers","novel pathogen","spread","United States","observed flu dynamics","signal","deflation","school closure","ecological interaction","precautionary behaviors","intervention analysis"],"language":"en"},

This classifier is designed for binary classification, assuming one class is surrounded by the other class in very diverse radial directions, which is seen to be typical for our virus detection data. This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions naturally motivates the development of Radial DWD. While classical machine learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance Weighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data set, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear separating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more appropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary. Simulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better generalizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional kernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods essentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape of the separating boundary. The effectiveness of Radial DWD is demonstrated for real virus detection.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Jie; Dittmer, D. P.; Marron, J.

However, predicting a conserved RNA structure remains unreliable, even when using a combination of thermodynamic stability and evolutionary covariation information. Here we present a method to predict a conserved RNA structure that combines the following three features. First, it uses significant covariation due to RNA structure and removes spurious covariation due to phylogeny. Second, it uses negative evolutionary information: basepairs that have variation but no significant covariation are prevented from occurring. Lastly, it uses a battery of probabilistic folding algorithms that incorporate all positive covariation into one structure. The method, named CaCoFold (Cascade variation/covariation Constrained Folding algorithm), predicts a nested structure guided by a maximal subset of positive basepairs, and recursively incorporates all remaining positive basepairs into alternative helices. The alternative helices can be compatible with the nested structure such as pseudoknots, or overlapping such as competing structures, base triplets, or other 3D non-antiparallel interactions. We present evidence that CaCoFold predictions are consistent with structures modeled from crystallography. Author Summary The availability of deeper comparative sequence alignments and recent advances in statistical analysis of RNA sequence covariation have made it possible to identify a reliable set of conserved base pairs, as well as a reliable set of non-basepairs (positions that vary without covarying). Predicting an overall consensus secondary structure consistent with a set of individual inferred pairs and non-pairs remains a problem. Current RNA structure prediction algorithms that predict nested secondary structures cannot use the full set of inferred covarying pairs, because covariation analysis also identifies important non-nested pairing interactions such as pseudoknots, base triples, and alternative structures. Moreover, although algorithms for incorporating negative constraints exist, negative information from covariation analysis (inferred non-pairs) has not been systematically exploited. Here I introduce an efficient approximate RNA structure prediction algorithm that incorporates all inferred pairs and excludes all non-pairs. Using this, and an improved visualization tool, I show that the method correctly identifies many non-nested structures in agreement with known crystal structures, and improves many curated consensus secondary structure annotations in RNA sequence alignment databases.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rivas, Elena","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.933952","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved RNA structure","non-pairs","covariation analysis","non-nested structures","positive covariation","significant covariation","spurious covariation","Current RNA structure prediction algorithms","nested secondary structures","evolutionary covariation information","statistical analysis of RNA sequence covariation","alternative structures","reliable set of non-basepairs","structure of conserved structural RNAs","set of inferred covarying pairs","efficient approximate RNA structure prediction algorithm","set of individual inferred pairs","reliable set of conserved base pairs","overall consensus secondary structure consistent","curated consensus secondary structure annotations","competing structures","important non-nested pairing interactions","RNA sequence alignment databases","negative information","method","D non-antiparallel interactions","known crystal structures","remaining positive basepairs","negative evolutionary information","alternative helices","maximal subset of positive basepairs","pseudoknots","base triplets","base triples","negative constraints","battery of probabilistic folding algorithms","Cascade variation","CaCoFold predictions","present evidence","availability of deeper comparative sequence alignments","recent advances","agreement","combination of thermodynamic stability","positions","Author Summary","function","problem","mechanism of action","improved visualization tool","phylogeny","features","crystallography"],"language":"en"},

However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in the light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can improve containment and achieve successful epidemic mitigation even with relatively small fraction of the population using it, and, with increasing penetrance of its adoption, suppression. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draw attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferrari, A.; Santus, E.; Cirillo, D.; Ponce-de-Leon, M.; Marino, N.; Ferretti, M.

The disease of transmissible person-to-person pneumonia caused by the extreme acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-COV-2, also known as COVID-19), has sparked a global warning. Thermal screening, quarantining, and later lockdown were methods employed by various nations to contain the spread of the virus. Though exercising various possible plans to contain the spread help in mitigating the effect of COVID-19, projecting the rise and preparing to face the crisis would help in minimizing the effect. In the scenario, this study attempts to use Machine Learning tools to forecast the possible rise in number of cases by considering the data of daily new cases. To capture the uncertainty, three different techniques: (i) Decision Tree algorithm, (ii) Support Vector Machine algorithm, and (iii) Gaussian process regression are used to project the data and capture the possible deviation. Based on the projection of new cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, medical facilities, population density, number of test conducted, and facilities of services, are considered to define the criticality index (CI). CI is used to classify all the districts of country in the regions of high risk, low risk and moderate risk. An online dashpot is created which updates the data on daily bases for next four weeks.

Logistic/Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify which demographic and/or clinical characteristics were associated with COVID-19 severity/death. Results: 87 (82%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 19(18%) with severe disease. Age, sex, ethnicity, SES, and current cancer treatment were not associated with COVID-19 severity.

Currently, mainly anti-spike (S)-protein adaptive immunity is investigated. However, also the nucleocapsid (N)- and membrane (M)-proteins should be considered as diagnostic and prophylactic targets. The aim of our study was to explore and compare the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-, M- and N-proteins in context of different COVID-19 manifestations. Analyzing a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease severity, we show that overlapping peptide pools (OPP) of all three proteins can activate SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells with a stronger response of CD4\u002B compared to CD8\u002B T-cells. Although interindividual variations for the three proteins were observed, M protein induced the highest frequencies of CD4\u002B T-cells, suggesting its relevance as diagnostic and vaccination target. Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest frequencies of cytokine-producing bi- and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. To this end, activation of effector T-cells with differentiated memory phenotype found in our study could cause hyper-reactive response in critical cases leading to immunopathogenesis. Conclusively, since the S-, M-, and N-proteins induce T-cell responses with individual differences, all three proteins should be evaluated for diagnostics and therapeutic strategies to avoid underestimation of cellular immunity and to deepen our understanding of COVID-19 immunity.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thieme, C.

A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach and represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gohl, Daryl M.; Garbe, John; Grady, Patrick; Daniel, Jerry; Watson, Ray H.

For example, they are often called upon to support civilian authorities in humanitarian crises and to provide routine healthcare for civilians. Furthermore, military personnel are a unique population in a health security context, as they are highly mobile and often deploy to austere settings domestically and internationally, which may increase exposure to infectious diseases. Despite the role of militaries, few studies have systematically evaluated the involvement of militaries in global health security activities, including the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). To address this shortcoming, we analyzed Joint External Evaluation (JEE) mission reports (n=91) and National Action Plans for Health Security (n=11) that had been completed as of October 2019 (n=91) to determine the extent to which military organizations have been involved in the evaluation process, country military contributions to health security are accounted for, and specific recommendations are provided for the country\u0027s military. For JEE reports, military involvement was highest for the \u0022Respond\u0022 core area (73%) but much lower for the Prevent (36%) and Detect (30%) core areas. Similarly, 73% of NAPHS documents mentioned military involvement in the Respond core area, compared to 27% and 36% for Prevent and Detect, respectively. Additionally, only 26% of JEE reports provide recommendations for the military in any of the core areas.

Monitoring the financial status, preventing or reducing systematic risk when crisis happens is highly concerned by the regulatory commission and banks. We propose visual analytics approach for loan guarantee network risk management, and consolidate the five analysis tasks with financial experts: i) visual analytics for enterprises default risk, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and developed an interface to visualize key indicators; ii) visual analytics for high default groups, whereby a community detection based interactive approach is presented; iii) visual analytics for high defaults pattern, whereby a motif detection based interactive approach is described, and we adopt a Shneiderman Mantra strategy to reduce the computation complexity. iv) visual analytics for evolving guarantee network, whereby animation is used to help understanding the guarantee dynamic; v) visual analytics approach and interface for default diffusion path. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the government and bank to monitor the default spread status. It also provides insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systemic financial risk. We implement the system with case studies on a real-world guarantee network.

Method:This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers, which reported available findings on the association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection. We used the STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Result:In this present meta-analysis, 52 papers, including 8,463 COVID-19 patients, were studied. The prevalence of increased liver enzymes among the patients, including Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, were 30% and 21% in non-severe patients, respectively, which were 38% and 48% in severe patients.

Abstract Subject Molecular amplification (PCR) provides adequate rapid and specific diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (first agent responsible for community-wide bacterial pneumonia in children above 5 years of age). Method Positive (Chlamyl\u00E8ge\u00AE, Arg\u00E8ne) PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirate, respiratory samples and nasopharyngeal swab and/or positive serological test (ELISA). Results Diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection in 39 cases: 31 between September and December 2008 (30 children and one adult) and eight since June 2009 (three adults and five children). Children (mean age: 3.6years) were hospitalized in 88.6% of cases, mean hospitalization duration was 2.9 days for respiratory tract infections, mainly due to lack of response to \u03B2-lactamines therapy (65.7%). Four adults (mean age: 29.5 years) presented a pneumonia, with hospitalization for three of them with one in intensive care unit. Twenty-eight PCR have proved positive (87%): without associated serology (13), eight negative serologies, IgG and IgM positive (five), and IgG alone (two). Seven patients had only serological test for diagnosis: IgM\u00B1IgG. For two children, IgM positive only in isolation, with a PCR probably false negative. Conclusion The sensitivity of the serology in the diagnosis of mycoplasma infection is limited: IgM, which appear traditionally 1 week after clinical signs are mostly inexistent for adults and IgG rise at a later stage. Early diagnosis of child pneumoniae by PCR helped rapidly characterize this epidemic phenomenon and adapt the treatment.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dekeyser, S.; Bonnel, C.; Martinet, A.; Descamps, D.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/041b3910018cc8c61ba884da483fda3b609d68be.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811410000969; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811410000969","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eight PCR","PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirate","IgM positives","IgM positive only in isolation","IgG alone","IgG seules","the serology in the diagnosis","pneumoniae infection in","enfants","PCR probably false negative","proved positive","Method Positive","five children","two children","IgG rise at","were hospitalized in","specific diagnosis","in intensive care","Early diagnosis","Results Diagnosis","diagnostic des infections","years","mean age","ans","wide bacterial pneumonia in children above","or positive serological test","Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection","with hospitalization","three adults","infections respiratoires","Conclusion The sensitivity","PCR helped rapidly characterize this epidemic phenomenon","them with","respiratory tract infections","adapt the treatment","child pneumoniae","cases","Arg\u00E8ne","diagnostic diff\u00E9rentiel","Four adults","eight negative serologies","Chlamyl\u00E8ge","diagnostic pr\u00E9coce","s\u00E9rologie associ\u00E9e","sensibilit\u00E9 de la s\u00E9rologie","\u00E2ge moyen","Elisa","cas diagnostiqu\u00E9s","adultes","mycoplasma infection is limited","mean hospitalization duration was","response to \u03B2","Seven patients had only serological test","eight since June","to lack","respiratory samples","nasopharyngeal swab","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements respiratoires","lactamines therapy","without associated serology","community","which appear traditionally","week after clinical signs","mostly inexistent","first agent responsible","mainly","days","provides adequate rapid","aspiration nasopharyng\u00E9e","premi\u00E8re cause de pneumonies communautaires","presented","Abstract Subject Molecular amplification","\u00E9couvillonnage nasophayng\u00E9","aide rapide","between September","mycoplasmes reste limit\u00E9e","\u00E9chec de traitement","biologie mol\u00E9culaire","later stage","jours","semaine","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Objet","December","\u00E9l\u00E9vation tardive","permis","pneumopathies","Twenty","d\u00E9but des signes cliniques","s\u00E9rologies n\u00E9gatives","ph\u00E9nom\u00E8ne \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement paucicellulaire","M\u00E9thode Positivit\u00E9","s\u00E9rodiagnostic","R\u00E9sultats","hospitalisation","r\u00E9animation"],"language":"fr"},

From there it has been rapidly spreading inside and outside China. With initial death rates around 4%, COVID-19 patients at longer distances from Wuhan showed reduced mortality as was previously observed for the SARS coronavirus. However, the new coronavirus spreads more strongly, as it sheds long before onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. Rapid development of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate (RBD-CuMVTT) that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zha, Lisha; Zhao, Hongxin; Mohsen, Mona O.; Hong, Liang; Zhou, Yuhang; Li, Zehua; Yao, Chuankai; Guo, Lijie; Chen, Hongquan; Liu, Xuelan; Chang, Xinyue; Zhang, Jie; Li, Dong; Wu, Ke; Vogel, Monique; Bachmann, Martin F; Wang, Junfeng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89bb89748dd8defc3efa9e9937f15a8ab12e2633.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.079830","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","new SARS-CoV","optimized virus","RBD-CuMVTT","binding of spike protein","ACE2","cucumber mosaic virus","spike protein homologous","ermerging disease COVID","new coronavirus spreads","vaccine candidate","Higly repetitive display of RBD","protective vaccine","city of Wuhan","viral receptor","onset of symptoms","outside China","recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain","mice","longer distances","high levels of specific antibodies","particles","reduced mortality","patients","Rapid development","initial death rates","people","paramount importance"],"language":"en"},

Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). Methods: This is a multicenter retrospective study of 251 patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. Results: QTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc prolongation to \u003E 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 15.9% of patients. One patient developed TdP requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting QTc prolongation of \u003E 60 ms was normal. Conclusion: The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chorin, E.; Wadhwani, L.; Magnani, S.; Dai, M.; Shulman, E.; Nadeau-Routhier, C.; Knots, R.; Bar-Cohen, R.; Kogan, E.; Barbhaiya, C.; Aizer, A.; Holmes, D.; Bernstein, S.; Spinelli, M.; Park, D.

We aimed to examine the relationship of various prevailing population-based risk factors in comparison with mortality rate and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19. Methods: Demography and epidemiology data which have been identified as verified or postulated risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 were used. The number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths until April 16, 2020 for all affected countries were extracted from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 websites. Datasets for indicators that are fitting with the factors of COVID-19 mortality were extracted from the World Bank database. Out of about 185 affected countries, only top 50 countries were selected to be analyzed in this study. The following seven variables were included in the analysis, based on data availability and completeness: 1) proportion of people aged 65 above, 2) proportion of male in the population, 3) diabetes prevalence, 4) smoking prevalence, 5) current health expenditure, 6) number of hospital beds and 7) number of nurses and midwives. Quantitative analysis was carried out to determine the correlation between CFR and the aforementioned risk factors. Results: United States shows about 0.20% of confirmed cases in its country and it has about 4.85% of CFR. Luxembourg shows the highest percentage of confirmed cases of 0.55% but a low 2.05% of CFR, showing that a high percentage of confirmed cases does not necessarily lead to high CFR. There is a significant correlation between CFR, people aged 65 and above (p = 0.35) and diabetes prevalence (p = 0.01). However, in our study, there is no significant correlation between CFR of COVID-19, male gender (p = 0.26) and smoking prevalence (p = 0.60). Conclusion: Older people above 65 years old and diabetic patients are significant risk factors for COVID-19. Nevertheless, gender differences and smoking prevalence failed to prove a significant relationship with COVID-19 mortality rate and CFR.

Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time. Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013-2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first. Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400-700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints. Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication.

Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given today\u0027s ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. Objective: To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patient\u0027s basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patient\u0027s features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). Materials and Methods: Data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Results: Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 61%, 76%, 83%, and 84% for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization: age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, SARS-CoV-2 test status, immunosuppression and pregnancy; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), cardiovascular disease, asthma, and SARS-CoV-2 test status; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, gender, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pregnancy, and SARS-CoV-2 test result.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wollenstein-Betech, S.; Cassandras, C.

Hence, there is an urgency to find effective treatment. Of those patients afflicted in the United States, many have required treatment with ventilator secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data are needed regarding the benefit of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with Tocilizumab. Methods: Clinical outcomes data for patients admitted to Orange Regional Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 from Mar 15, 2020 to Apr 20, 2020 were identified through electronic health record chart review. We conducted a retrospective case-control study in confirmed COVID 19 positive patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and compared outcome in terms of mortality and length of stay amongst those who received Tocilizumab as treatment modality opposed to those that did not. Results: A total of 94 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were analyzed. 44 were in the study group and 50 in the control group. We tried to match both group as close as possible in terms of age, sex, BMI and HS score- calculated using inflammatory markers- ferritin, triglycerides, AST and fibrinogen. The median age was 55.5 years in the study group and 66 in the control group, difference was not statistically significant. Average HS score was 114 in the Tocilizumab group and 92 in the control group, difference was statistically significant with P\u003C0.0001. Also, the patients in the study group had elevated levels of IL-6, triglycerides, AST, ferritin which were statistically significant with p \u003C 0.0001 when compared to the control group. Length of stay was longer, average 17.9 days in the Tocilizumab. Survival rate was much lower at 48 % in the control group and 61.36 % in patients who received Tocilizumab with significant P value of \u003C 0.00001. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 7.48, if we treat 8 patients with Tocilizumab, 1 will not die. Conclusions: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) occurs in a large number of patients with severe COVID-19, which is also an important cause of death. IL- 6 is the key molecule of CRS, so IL-6R antagonist Tocilizumab may be of value in improving outcomes. In our study Tocilizumab group seemed to have improved survival outcome. Results have to be interpreted with caution since this is a retrospective study and mortality is affected by multiple, confounding factors. We await the results of ongoing randomized controlled trials to definitely answer the question of whether Tocilizumab improves survival in COVID-19 ARDS patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wadud, N.; Ahmed, N.; Mannu Shergil, M.; Khan, M.; Krishna, M.

The statistic of COVID-19 across the world is reported daily, providing a dynamic perspective for each country. We tested the hypothesis that the vaccination against tuberculosis with BCG correlates with better outcomes for COVID-19 patients. To this end, we combined the information on demography, economy, major chronic diseases, and immunization policies with the COVID-19 outcomes. We filtered out at a fixed date all countries that were below a predetermined value for population size and number of COVID-19 deaths per million (DPM). Altogether, 55 countries, covering 62.9% of the world population, met our criteria and were analyzed. To allow a reliable comparison between countries, each was aligned to a critical alignment threshold date (0.5 DPM). We found that the years of BCG admission are negatively correlated with DPM at varying times post alignment. Results from multivariable regression tests with 22 quantitative properties of each country and its population substantiate the dominant contribution of BCG admission years to the COVID-19 outcomes. Analyzing countries according to an age group partition across several time-points, reveals that the strongest correlation is attributed to the coverage in BCG vaccination of the young population (\u003C25 years), to a lesser degree the middle age group (25-64 years), while BCG coverage status of the elderly (\u003E65 years) was insignificant. More specifically, the signal is attributed to recent immunizations (last 15 years) rather than past policies. We propose that BCG immunization coverage, especially among the most recently vaccinated, may contribute to attenuation of the COVID-19 spread and severity.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klinger, Danielle; Blass, Ido; Rappoport, Nadav; Linial, Michal","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9597bb137a21c75fdc3642fb0ae48670b3061d27.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077123v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG","DPM"],"locations":["Hubei","China"],"keyphrases":["countries","years of BCG admission","BCG vaccination","number of COVID","statistic of COVID","BCG immunization coverage","BCG correlates","BCG coverage status","dominant contribution of BCG admission years","DPM","world population","population size","young population","better outcomes","immunization policies","country","spread","age group partition","middle age group","critical alignment threshold date","past policies","fixed date","varying times post alignment","major chronic diseases","tuberculosis","quantitative properties","multivariable regression tests","demography","economy","predetermined value","lesser degree","time-points","information","elderly","Results","strongest correlation","China","recent immunizations","Hubei province","deaths","patients","signal","dynamic perspective","hypothesis","reliable comparison","criteria","attenuation","severity","end","months"],"language":"en"},

Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians. Methods IRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020. Findings From an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with \u003E100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2% of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs, encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts. Interpretation Many resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.

The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Deqiang; Liu, Zhicheng; Liu, Qinghe; Gao, Zefei; Zhu, Junkai; Yang, Junyan; Wang, Qiao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1b9d81726e56c2781ce6b63ae5015cf2f314c6f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["traffic blockage control","current traffic blockage factor","current quarantine factor","icacy of quarantine","provincial level traffic blockage","start dates of quarantine","peak number of infections","epidemic control","simulated results","large number of populations","arrival time of infections","large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID","effective ways","cumulative number of confirmed cases","epidemic containing","time points","long time","efficacy","spread of COVID","Hubei province","risk","suceptibles","confirmed case data","migration data","public awareness","policy makers","China","Wuhan","change","importance of self-isolation","early of warning","actions","outbreaks","day","Flow-SEIR model","huge losses of economy","nCoV","Method","home","world","close contacting","provinces","intervation measures","study","self-protection","Conclusion","simulation","Background"],"language":"en"},

On the 16th of May around 4.5 million people got infected and over 300,000 died due to the infection of COV2. The effective treatment remains a challenge. Targeted therapeutics are still under investigation. The papain-like protease (PLPro) from the human SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a cysteine protease that plays a critical role in virus replication. Its activity is required to process the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits. Moreover, COV2 uses this enzyme to modulate the host\u2019s immune system to its own benefit. Therefore, it represents a highly promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. In this work, we discovered that ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity in mammalian cells and cytotoxicity in lower organisms, is a highly active inhibitor of PLProCoV2. We proved that ebselen is a covalent, fast-binding inhibitor of PLProCoV2 exhibiting a low micromolar potency. Furthermore, we identified a difference between PLPro from SARS-CoV-1 (the corona virus which caused the 2002\u20132004 outbreak, SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 that allows to explain the difference in dynamics of the replication, and, thus, the disease progression. Namely, we present that they show differences in the binding affinity of substrates that we observed through kinetics and molecular docking studies. Using a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method we were able to find kinetic constants for both enzymes. Molecular modeling study on the structure of the active site and binding mode of the ebselen with SARS and COV2 showed also significant differences that could explain our observation that ebselen is less active and slower bounding with SARS than COV2. In conclusion, we show that ebselen inhibits the activity of the essential viral enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS-COV-2 in low micromolar range.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"W\u0119glarz-Tomczak, Ewelina; Tomczak, Jakub M.; Talma, Micha\u0142; Brul, Stanley","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eecb37dcef709a4ee5dc8252a3f2bcc947bc12d7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100768","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ebselen","human SARS-CoV","infection of COV2","active inhibitor of PLProCoV2","cytoprotective activity","binding mode","cysteine protease","fast-binding inhibitor of PLProCoV2","active site","coronavirus","virus replication","essential viral enzyme papain","binding affinity of substrates","low micromolar potency","low micromolar range","viral polyprotein","significant differences","corona virus","Molecular modeling study","molecular docking studies","novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method","anti-inflammatory","anti-oxidant","mammalian cells","synthetic organoselenium drug molecule","cytotoxicity","structure","lower organisms","critical role","kinetics","host\u2019s immune system","mature subunits","observation","development of antiviral drugs","promising target","kinetic constants","benefit","effective treatment","challenge","Targeted therapeutics","investigation","enzymes","dynamics","outbreak","people","disease progression","world","conclusion","work"],"language":"en"},

Interventions: All masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave (34-minute total cycle time of steam sterilization, with 17 minutes at 121 degrees Celsius) and subsequently tested up to 3 times whether these decontaminated respirators retained their integrity (seal check, pressure drop) and ability to filter small particles (0.3-5.0 microns) in the laboratory using a particle penetration test. Results: We tested 32 respirators, and 63 samples for filter capacity. All 27 FFP-2 respirators retained their shape, whereas half of the sterilized FFP-3 respirators (Safe Worker 1116) showed deformities and failed the seal check.

For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. Methods We performed an international multi-center study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the Quadripartite Equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. Results Seventeen large- and medium- sized liver transplant centers from twelve countries across four continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a \u201Csickest-first\u201D approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - Recipient Outcome, Donor/Graft Safety, Waiting List Mortality and Healthcare Resources for seven countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. Conclusions This four-dimensional model of Quadripartite Equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems to allow greater global solidarity and transparency in these austere times.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chew, Claire Alexandra; Iyer, Shridhar Ganpathi; Chieh Kow, Alfred Wei; Madhavan, Krishnakumar; Teng Wong, Andrea Sze; Halazun, Karim J.; Battula, Narendra; Scalera, Irene; Angelico, Roberta; Farid, Sharid; Buchholz, Bettina M.; Rotellar, Fernando; Chi-Yan Chan, Albert; Kim, Jong Man; Wang, Chih-Chi; Pitchaimuthu, Maheswaran; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Soin, Arvinder Singh; Derosas, Carlos; Imventarza, Oscar; Isaac, John; Muiesan, Paolo; Mirza, Darius F.; Bonney, Glenn Kunnath","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df71d4bf0c0b0ae9d9a3ea6c04596338755203db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827820303421; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827820303421?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Quadripartite Equipoise","Healthcare Resources"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ethical tensions","liver transplantation","transplant prioritization","routine transplant activity","regulation of transplant activity","medium- sized liver transplant centers","ethical frameworks","QE score","novel ethical framework","response","Healthcare Resources","current pandemic","international multi-center study of transplant centers","healthcare systems","larger centers","end-stage liver failure","list mortality","applicable framework","countries","availability of national resources","four-dimensional model of Quadripartite Equipoise","context of limited national resources","increasing burden","operational burden","urgent need","Graft Safety","greater global solidarity","Donor","factors - Recipient Outcome","transparency","dynamic changes","order","evolution of policies","intensive care facilities","patients","Conclusions","setting","austere times","ABSTRACT Background","outbreak of Covid","strain","Methods","fluctuation","Results","major concern","continents","option","approach"],"language":"en"},

The mutation events in the isolates obey the Markov process and exhibit very high mutational rates, which occur in six specific genes and highest in orf1ab gene, leading to virulent nature. f (\u03B1) analysis indicated that the isolates are highly asymmetric (left-skewed), revealing the richness of complexity and dominance by large fluctuations in genome structure organization. The values of Hq and Dq are found to be significantly large, showing heterogeneous genome structure self-organization, strong positive correlation in organizing the isolates, and quite sensitive to fluctuations in and around it. We then present multiple-isolates hosts-virus interaction models, and derived Price equation for the model. The phase plane analysis of the model showed asymptotic stability type bifurcation.

Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens.

This study is to test the hypothesis that environmental surfaces played important roles in transmission for SARS-CoV-2 during this outbreak. Methods We sampled environmental surfaces including air from common areas in the cruise ship and cabins in which confirmed COVID-19 cases and non-cases had stayed after they left the cabins. We tested the samples for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR and conducted viral isolation. Findings Of 601 samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 samples (10%) from case-cabins from which they left 1-17 days before sampling, but not from non-case-cabins. Except for one sample from an air hood in a corridor, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from samples in common areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from all 14 air samples. RNA was most often detected on the floor around toilet in the bathroom (39%, 13/33, cycle quantification (Cq): 26.21-37.62) and bed pillow (34%, 11/32, Cq: 34.61-38.99).

We obtained nasal swabs from students with ILI-related absences. Generalized linear mixed-effect regressions determined associations of outcomes, including ILI and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection, with school grade and other covariates. Results: Overall, 459 swabs were obtained from 552 ILI-related absences. Respiratory viruses were found in 292 (63.6%) samples. Influenza was found in 189 (41.2%) samples. with influenza B found in 134 (70.9%).

While these quantities are immediately estimable given current data, they suffer from dependence on the underlying testing strategies within communities. Specifically, they are inextricably tied to the likelihood that an infected individual is tested and identified as a case.

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend.

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz\u0027s function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Wuyue; Zhang, Dongyan; Peng, Liangrong; Zhuge, Changjing; Hong, Liu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f91066bc15728c9bdb5441363b2ff4671b674ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["model complexity","model robustness","dynamical models","SEIR-PO models","SEIR-AHQ models","various epidemic models","reliable predictable model","inflection point","reliable forecast","fitting accuracy","SEIR-QD","progression of epidemics","study of epidemics","over-fitting","under-fitting","overestimation","final epidemic size","public COVID","forecast ability","reliable prediction","effective reproduction number","statistical inference methods","methods of sequential Bayesian","severe threat of COVID","time-dependent reproduction number","robustness index","Gomertz\u0027s function","size of dataset","Logistic function","behavior of exponential growth method","rational evaluation of various possible choices","non-constant nature","root","square errors","underestimation","proper trade-off","empirical functions","better performance","SIR","golden means","respect","Akaike information criterion","crucial role","cities","follow-up actions of individuals","quarantine","provinces","balance","future trends","problems","China","governments","inclusion of self-protection","transition","systematical investigation","success","spring","forecasting","late stage","paper","consideration","cases","significance","literature","ODEs","sensitivity","extensive simulations"],"language":"en"},

A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and arXiv databases using the following search terms [\u0022artificial intelligence\u0022 OR \u0022deep learning\u0022 OR \u0022neural networks\u0022], AND [\u0022COVID-19\u0022 OR \u0022SARS-CoV-2\u0022] AND [\u0022chest X-ray\u0022 OR \u0022CXR\u0022 OR \u0022X-ray\u0022] found 14 recent studies. Most of them declared to be able to confidently identify COVID-19 based on CXRs using deep neural networks. Firstly, weaknesses of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions were analyzed, tackling the issues with datasets (from both medical and technical points of view) and the vulnerability of used algorithms. Then, arguments were provided for why our study design is stronger and more realistic than the previously quoted papers, balancing the possible false expectations with facts. The authors consider that the potential of AI use in COVID-19 diagnosis on CXR is real. However, scientific community should be careful in interpreting statements, results and conclusions regarding AI use in imaging. It is therefore necessary to adopt standards for research and publication of data, because it seems that in the recent months scientific reality suffered manipulations and distortions. Also, a call for responsible approaches to the imaging methods in COVID-19 is raised. It seems mandatory to follow some rigorous approaches in order to provide with adequate results in daily routine. In addition, the authors intended to raise public awareness about the quality of AI protocols and algorithms and to encourage public sharing of as many CXR images with common quality standards.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burlacu, A.; Crisan-Dabija, R.; Popa, I.

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 \u002B- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 \u002B- 0.43 and 1.55 \u002B- 0.61, P\u003C0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P\u003C0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001).

Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ru; Ming, Xiaoyan; Xu, Ou; Zhou, Jianli; Peng, Hui; Xiang, Ning; Zhang, Jiaming; Zhu, Hong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0562f70516579d557cd1486000bb7aac5ccec2a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CVMs group","concomitant CVMs","hospital outcomes of COVID","hospital adverse events","cases","hospital staff data","confirmed COVID","Patients","frequent symptoms of COVID","Central Hospital of Wuhan","general clinical features of COVID","Clinical data","non-severe course of disease","favor of severe conversion of non-severe case","clinical nurses","treatment data","outbreaks of coronavirus disease","history of patient contact","fatigue","myalgia","China","fever","cough","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","consecutive hospitalized health staff","frequent initial symptoms","public health","comparative study","community population","single-center case series","laboratory","positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab","Retrospective","terms","SARS-CoV","admission","demographic","risk factors","lower baseline lymphocyte count","association of cardiovascular manifestations","huge threat","official standard","Multivariable logistic regression model","Methods","clinicians","Background","rate","Final date of follow-up","received oxygen support","mean age","comorbidities","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

To report a comparison between fatalities and recovery of the severe Covid-19 infected patients based on demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods. Between 5 March and 12 May 2020, of 4,000 patients, 1,278 were laboratory confirmed to be Covid-19 infection in Mashhad, Iran. Finally, 334 deceased and 733 recovered cases were assessed in terms of demography, exposure history, health outcomes and clinical symptoms. Results. Mean (SD) age for confirmed patients, for deceased cases and for recovered cases. Mean (SD) age for all confirmed-patients was 56.9 (18.74), for the fatalities 67.26 (15.77) and for those recovered 52.82 (17.91) years. The rise of the mortality rate in relation to seniority was statistically significant. Despite a high frequency of Covid-19 infections accrued in the age groups of 30-39 and 40-49 years, most of these cases (88.2 and 85.8%, respectively) recovered. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalization was 9.0 (9) days. The most prevalent co-morbidities were cardiovascular disorders (21%) and diabetes (16.3%).

ABSTRACT The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which gives rise to the highly contagious COVID-19 disease, has caused a pandemic that is overwhelming health care systems worldwide. Affected patients have been reported to have a heightened inflammatory state that increases their thrombotic risk.

We evaluated a novel proprietary formulation based on an emulsion of short chain caprylic acid, ViroSAL, for its ability to inhibit a range of viral infections in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, ViroSAL inhibited the enveloped viruses Epstein-Barr, measles, herpes simplex, Zika and orf parapoxvirus, together with Ebola, Lassa, vesicular stomatitis and SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Evaluation of the components of ViroSAL revealed that caprylic acid was the main antiviral component; however, the ViroSAL formulation significantly inhibited viral entry compared with caprylic acid alone. In vivo, ViroSAL significantly inhibited Zika and Semliki Forest Virus replication in mice following the inoculation of these viruses into mosquito bite sites. In agreement with studies investigating other free fatty acids, ViroSAL had no effect on norovirus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that its mechanism of action may be via surfactant disruption of the viral envelope.

Italy is among the world\u0027s worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.

We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria.

Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of vitamin C, as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating vitamin C in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

Amid the increasing number of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, there is a need for a quick and easy method to obtain a non-invasive sample for the detection of this novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods. From 27 March to 4 April, 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Results. Two-hundred pairs of the samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) patients were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.2%-89.3%], and 98.9% (95% CI 97.5-100.3%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (kappa coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p \u003C0.001). Conclusions. Saliva specimens can be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection method is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. Using a saliva sample as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, which is one of the strategies that helps in controlling the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pasomsub, Ekawat; Watcharananan, Siriorn P.; Boonyawat, Kochawan; Janchompoo, Pareena; Wongtabtim, Garanyuta; Suksuwan, Worramin; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek; Phuphuakrat, Angsana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac6c0caab3f814f5267a62c2569da6cbd79fad57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20070045v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["saliva sample RT-PCR","diagnosis of COVID","Saliva specimens","throat swab RT-PCR","non-invasive sample","outbreak of COVID","prevalence of COVID","potential use of saliva samples","non-invasive tool","detection of SARS","agreement","SARS-CoV","results","reference standard","novel coronavirus","easy method","collection method","increasing number of global pandemic coronavirus disease","care","persons","university hospital","acute respiratory infection clinic","Real-time polymerase chain reaction","median","need","specificity","non-aerosol","male","kappa coefficient","sensitivity","patients","age","confidence interval","cases","strategies","epidemic","analysis","pairs","Objectives","Methods","years","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus member of the family Arteriviridae from the order Nidovirales like the Coronaviridae. EAV causes respiratory and reproductive diseases in equids. Although two vaccines are available, the vaccination coverage of the equine population is largely insufficient to prevent new EAV outbreaks around the world. In this study, we present a high-throughput in vitro assay suitable for testing candidate antiviral molecules on equine dermal cells infected by EAV. Using this assay, we identified three molecules that impair EAV infection in equine cells: the broad-spectrum antiviral and nucleoside analog ribavirin, and two compounds previously described as inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the fourth enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. These molecules effectively suppressed cytopathic effects associated to EAV infection, and strongly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious particles. Since ribavirin is already approved in human and small animal, and that several DHODH inhibitors are in advanced clinical trials, our results open new perspectives for the management of EAV outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valle-Casuso, Jos\u00E9 Carlos; Gaudaire, Delphine; Martin-Faivre, Lydie; Madeline, Anthony; Dallemagne, Patrick; Pronost, St\u00E9phane; Munier-Lehmann, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Zientara, Stephan; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Hans, Aymeric","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/417724ea7cd1473ca223a7b1581f0c1221b5151a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.035402","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EAV infection","new EAV outbreaks","management of EAV outbreaks","equine cells","equine population","equine dermal cells","Equine Arteritis Virus","DHODH inhibitors","testing candidate antiviral molecules","broad-spectrum antiviral","assay suitable","RNA viruses","small animal","positive single-stranded RNA virus member","nucleoside analog ribavirin","inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase","results open new perspectives","large variety of animal infections","advanced clinical trials","family Arteriviridae","viral replication","vaccination coverage","compounds","high-throughput","order Nidovirales","production of infectious particles","enzyme","reproductive diseases","cytopathic effects","pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway","equids","vaccines","human","world","Coronaviridae","study"],"language":"en"},

RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives can occur if the sample contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests. This work has implications both for the identification of infected patients and for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wikramaratna, Paul; Paton, Robert S; Ghafari, Mahan; Lourenco, Jose","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c52ae1786fb5afb844f446fac316bd14ba7cd5ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053355","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probability of false positive tests","likely false negative rates","false negatives","cohorts of patients","probability of false positives","expected numbers of false negative tests","estimates of false negative rates","time","multiple RT-PCR tests","virus","identification of infected patients","discharge of convalescing patients","positive test decreases","symptom onset","throat samples","nasal samples","positive result relative","infection","causative SARS-CoV","sample location","Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","testing","sputum","key workers","group of tested individuals","assays","derived distributions","available data","different clinical stages","implications","insufficient quantities","hospitalisation","robustness","swab","timing"],"language":"en"},

The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Methodology: Data were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [\u2265]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020. Results: Brazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates. Conclusions: The COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simbana-Rivera, K.; Gomez-Barreno, L.; Guerrero, J.; Simbana-Guaycha, F.; Fernandez, R.; Lopez-Cortes, A.; Lister, A.; Ortiz-Prado, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d9fcbf04bb480628206a83ff8f0a707a0dc6f62.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20079863v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center for Systems Science and Engineering","Johns Hopkins University","LAC"],"locations":["Trinidad","Tobago","Bolivia","Honduras","Panama","Chile","Dominican Republic","Ecuador","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["LAC countries","testing rates","death rates","incidence rates","tests","COVID","disease pandemic","deaths","virus pandemic","number of confirmed cases","greatest number of cases","novel coronavirus disease","highest case fatality rates","highest positive test rates","Brazil","Bolivia","SARS-CoV","inhabitants","Panama","adopting similar disease control methods","Systems Science","limited testing","health systems","CSSE","Honduras","cumulative mortality","databases","Engineering","Ecuador","Trinidad","Center","situation reports","Tobago","Descriptive statistics","Johns Hopkins University","rapid increase","resources","relentless advance","Caribbean","trends","social distancing","Dominican Republic","significant burden","study","Results","population","risk","Chile","day","Objective","aim","Background","Uruguay","strain","date","spread","socio-economic conditions","comparison analysis","Conclusions","region","Methodology","Salvador","people"],"language":"en"},

Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate. Therefore, these PIPs might play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in some patients. Highlights Nine potential PIPs were predicted exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 PIPs showed homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Most of PIPs were produced by enzymatic cleavage of the spike glycoproteins.

Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85\u00D710\u22127M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ke; Chen, Wei; Zhou, Yu-Sen; Lian, Jian-Qi; Zhang, Zheng; Du, Peng; Gong, Li; Zhang, Yang; Cui, Hong-Yong; Geng, Jie-Jie; Wang, Bin; Sun, Xiu-Xuan; Wang, Chun-Fu; Yang, Xu; Lin, Peng; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Wei, Ding; Yang, Xiang-Min; Zhu, Yu-Meng; Zhang, Kui; Zheng, Zhao-Hui; Miao, Jin-Lin; Guo, Ting; Shi, Ying; Zhang, Jun; Fu, Ling; Wang, Qing-Yi; Bian, Huijie; Zhu, Ping; Chen, Zhi-Nan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22bcda395b7dbb5595e3af30912bbd327ea970a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.988345","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ELISA"],"organizations":["SP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","invading host cells","new route CD147-SP","localization of CD147","invaded host cells","novel route of CD147","anti-CD147 humanized antibody","infected Vero E6 cells","development of specific antiviral drugs","antiviral tests","\u03BCg","research","finding","critical target","Meplazumab","immuno-electron microscope","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","disease","viruses","spike protein","treatment","EC50","receptor","great challenge","binding","ELISA","control","discovery","Co-Immunoprecipitation","viral invasion","affinity constant","COVID","IC50","interaction","proteins","world"],"language":"en"},

However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; \u03B1-HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (\u2265 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and \u03B1-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and \u03B1-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and \u03B1-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Chaomin; Hu, Xianglin; Song, Jianxin; Du, Chunling; Xu, Jie; Yang, Dong; Chen, Dechang; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Jinjun; Xiong, Weining; Lang, Ke; Zhang, Yuye; Shi, Guohua; Xu, Lei; Song, Yuanlin; Zhou, Xin; Wei, Ming; Zheng, Junhua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital","China"],"keyphrases":["admission","COVID","older patients","male patients","High levels of heart injury indicators","increased inflammatory levels","Increased hs-TnI levels","Increased CK-MB levels","high LDH","higher mortality","immune levels","\u03B1-HBDH levels","Heart injury signs","signs of heart injury","High hs-TnI","High CK-MB","Increased LDH","respiratory injury","LDH level","shorter survival days","hypertension","inflammatory storm","decreased lymphocytes","current smoking","years","pg","Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital","clinical normal range","Participants","single-center retrospective cohort study","CD4","monocytes","Measures","neutrophils","standard deviation","mean age","CD8","Conclusions","Relevance","comorbidity","Exposures","viral infection","Main Outcomes","adenovirus","enterovirus","T cells","Setting","CRP","China","PCT","Design","coronavirus disease","Importance","Objective","Results","cardiologists"],"language":"en"},

Design: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers. Data Source: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included smoking, smoker*, characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, and COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, sar cov-2, sar cov 2. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. Main Outcome Measures: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. Results: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. Conclusions: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patanavanich, R.; Glantz, S.

Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Methods We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results We projected a declining trend of the COVID-19 epidemic if the current quarantine strategy continues, and Wuhan would record the last new confirmed cases in late April 2020. At the end of the epidemic, 65,733 (45,722-99,015) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,166 (11,238-24,603, 24.6%) were through public contacts, 45,996 (31,892-69,565, 69.7%) through household contact, and 3,571 (2,521-5,879, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 778 (553-1,154) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,786 (1,969-4,791) medical staff). A total of 2,821 (1,634-6,361) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. Early quarantine lifting on 21st March is viable only if Wuhan residents sustain a high facial mask usage of \u226585% and a pre-quarantine level public contact rate. Delaying city resumption to mid/late April would relax the requirement of facial mask usage to \u226575% at the same contact rate. Conclusions The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lei; Shen, Mingwang; Ma, Xiaomeng; Su, Shu; Gong, Wenfeng; Wang, Jing; Tao, Yusha; Zou, Zhuoru; Zhao, Rui; Lau, Joseph T.F.; Li, Wei; Liu, Feng; Ye, Kai; Wang, Youfa; Zhuang, Guihua; Fairley, Christopher K.","journal":"The Innovation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c341bb749ba736f1e2bba6b41dddb6f543cd28.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666675820300060; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675820300060","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["epidemic","different quarantine","Early quarantine","pre-quarantine level public contact rate","metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city","current quarantine strategy","requirement of facial mask usage","low public contact rate","sustaining high facial mask usage","public contacts","household contact","non-COVID","coronavirus COVID","impact of different rates of public contact","Wuhan residents","city resumption","declining trend","hospital contacts","Chinese government","dates","key health interventions","compartmental dynamic model","new confirmed cases","Summary Background","Methods","effects","prevention","related pneumonia","patients","Conclusions","individuals","medical staff","total"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19, hospitalized in a tertiary care teaching hospital in southwestern United states serving Underserved population. Methods: Case series of first 50 adults admitted at the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Science center, the only tertiary care teaching hospital in the state of New Mexico between Jan 19th to April 24th 2020 via retrospective and prospective chart review. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results: A total of 50 patients were included (median age, 55.5; 20-85-year-old, 54% were female). Obesity was the most common comorbidity in 20/39 (51%), followed by diabetes in 18/50 (36%) and hypertension 17/50(34%). Mean onset of symptoms duration before admission 7.39 days (range 1-21days). Most common symptoms on presentation included subjective fevers 40/42 (95.2%), cough 43/46 (93%) 43/46 and shortness of breath 40/46(87%). At triage only 24% were febrile and 46% patient did not have a single febrile episode throughout hospitalization, 56% had respiratory rate \u003E 20 and 66% had a heart rate \u003E 90. 80% patients required oxygen and 20%required intubation on presentation. On differential analysis 46% had elevated neutrophil counts, and 48% had low lymphocytes counts. Median D dimer, Ferritin, CRP, LDH were all elevated at presentation. 10% of patients had a negative initial chest x ray. 19.3% patients have coinfection with another respiratory viral pathogen. 34 (68%) patient required ICU level of care at some point during hospitalization. More than 70% of patients were treated with antibiotics mainly directed towards community acquired pneumonia but 97.5% patient has negative blood culture and 93.3% has negative sputum cultures. Of admitted patients, 34% (17/50) were directly admitted to ICU and. Of these ICU patients 82.4% (28/34) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients spent a median of 2 days on the floor prior to ICU transfer, median length of stay in the ICU was 7 days. On comparing characteristics of patients, patients with diabetes, and higher lactate dehydrogenase on admission were more likely to require ICU level of care. No patient deaths were reported on the floor. Of 34 patients in the ICU 13 died while 6 are still receiving care in the hospital, with an overall mortality of 30.2% (13/43). Out of 13 patients who died, 2 were on HD, 11/13(84%) patients had acute kidney injury and required CRRT or HD. The median length of stay is 7 days (Range 1-31days), for floor patients 4 days and ICU patients 13 days. Out of 43 patients who completed their clinical course 24/43(58.1%) were discharged home, 5/43(11.6%) went to rehabilitation facilities and 30.2% died. 16/30(53.3%) required oxygen on discharge.

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Z.; Tang, J.; Chai, X.; Fang, Z.; Liu, Q.; Hu, X.; Xu, D.; He, J.; Tang, L.; Tai, S.; Wu, Y.; Zhou, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdc5501c4682a6e312c921426c409214f9dac0b0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.04.20031047v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heart failure group","differentiating COVID","suspected COVID","pneumonia","imaging of chest CT","chest CT findings","overlaps of CT imaging","comparison of CT imaging","septal thickening","METHODS Patients","screening patients","peribronchovascular thickening","fissural thickening","chest computed tomography","cardiac enlargement","statistical difference","difference of ground glass opacity","upper pulmonary vein enlargement","consolidation","GGO","lobes","crazy paving pattern","epidemic period","subpleural effusion","Corona Virus Disease","useful tool","BACKGROUND","Clinical information","OBJECTIVES","diseases","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","fibrous lesions","peripheral distribution","rounded morphology"],"language":"en"},

Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries\u0027 government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan\u0027s NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan. Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Hongxin; Man, Sailimai; Wang, Bo; Ning, Yi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5585d267f9b505b068f9f72bff5f12c248472f0a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCP"],"locations":["China","Japan","Germany","France"],"keyphrases":["NCP incidence of Wuhan","nCov infection","incidence of NCP","infection rate","nCov infected","people","infection risk of evacuees","Wuhan\u0027s NCP incidence estimation","novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","China","results","large-scale public health interventions","huge public health threats","group meta-analysis method","Chinese citizens","evacuation of Korea","confirmed cases","data of evacuation","draconian measures","random effect model","Germany","population mobility","countries\u0027 government rush","Singapore","total number","Japan","France","Hubei province","beginning","outbreak","Methods","epidemic","Conclusions","Background"],"language":"en"},

Within Europe, the first countries to be strongly affected have been Italy and Spain. In Spain, infection has expanded in highly populated areas, resulting in one of the largest nationwide bursts so far by early April. We analyze the evolution of the growth curve of the epidemic in both the whole of Spain and Madrid Autonomous Region (the second largest conurbation in Europe), based on the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths. We conducted segmented, linear regressions on log-transformed data to identify changes in the slope of these curves and/or sudden shifts in the number of cases (i.e. changes in the intercept) at fitted breaking points, and compared their results with a timeline including both key events of the epidemic and containment measures taken by the national and regional governments. Results were largely consistent in the four curves analyzed (reported infections and deaths for Spain and Madrid, respectively), showing two major shifts in slopes (growth rates) at 14-15 and 26-29 March that resulted in 37-65% reductions of slope, and originated in infection on 4-5 and 16-18 March (for case detections) and 14-23 February and 5-6 March (for deaths). Small upward shifts in the progress of the disease in Madrid were not associated with significant changes in the intercept of the curve, and seem related with unevenness in case reporting. These results evidence an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19 coinciding with personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, as well as the general awareness of the population; and a second, stronger decrease when harder isolation measures were enforced. The combination of both breakpoints seemingly led to the start of the contention of the disease outbreak by early April, the limit of our time series. This highlights the importance of adopting public health strategies that include disseminating basic knowledge on personal hygiene and reduced social contact at the onset of the epidemic, and the importance of early enforcement of hard contention measures for its subsequent contention.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santamaria, Luis; Hortal, Joaquin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24c5610d5aea11c5216c113e9770184ece0f1ef3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059345","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Spain"],"keyphrases":["Spain","epidemic","deaths","results","importance of early enforcement of hard contention measures","containment measures","early deceleration","personal hygiene","social contact","subsequent contention","social structure","harder isolation measures","major shifts","sudden shifts","growth curve","curves","disease outbreak","intercept","spread of COVID","significant changes","Europe","social distancing recommendations","Madrid Autonomous Region","Small upward shifts","largest conurbation","growth rates","number of cases","cumulative numbers of reported cases","case reporting","reductions of slope","case detections","largest nationwide bursts","basic knowledge","coinciding","log","age","data","key events","progress","public health strategies","different impacts","stronger decrease","linear regressions","unevenness","slopes","limit","populations","infections","China","timeline","breaking points","start","onset","general awareness","regional governments","breakpoints","time series","populated areas","evolution","combination","countries","pandemic","Italy"],"language":"en"},

It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age\u003E=40 years and age\u003C40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter.

This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. Twitter reflected the clear, structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify potential sources of misinformation as well as key actors (especially early adopters) and influencers. Conclusions: Traditional and social media not only reflect reality, but also create it. Polish authorities, having a reliable analysis of the perception of the problem, could optimally prepare and manage the social dimension of the current epidemic and future ones. Due to filter bubbles observed on Twitter, public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected. For greater penetration, it might be necessary to diversify information channels to reach as many people as possible which might already be happening. Moreover, it might be necessary to prevent the spread of disinformation, which is now possible due to the special law on combating COVID-2019.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarynowski, Andrzej; Wojta-Kempa, Monika; Belik, Vitaly","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/985fe76051dbb01fca9e3d73efb7ca35345f130e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046789","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Google"],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["disease introduction","perception of COVID","social media","epidemic perception","topic COVID","Twitter","Polish society","Polish authorities","official introduction","social network analysis","social dimension","Polish government","quantitative analysis","reliable analysis","electronic media","Polish political sphere","Poland","Problem","public information campaigns","recent special law","public health","practical concepts","information channels","spread of disinformation","spread of SARS CoV","examined internet platform","Italy-related peaks","representativeness","preparation of specific actions","natural language processing techniques","Wikipedia","structural division","data mining","virus infection","Google","fear","YouTube","China","war","digital footprints","key actors","economic risks","early adopters","potential sources of misinformation","composition","issues of threat","platforms","prevention","impact","massive mitigation program","Event Registry","future ones","major cluster","filter bubbles","exponential increase","urgent need","target group","end","people","Conclusions","influencers","Results","greater penetration","sociolingistic perspective","day","reality","Methods"],"language":"en"},

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised.

Although the majority of COVID-19 patients experience only mild or moderate symptoms, a subset will progress to severe disease with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response characterized by runaway inflammation, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as the major driver of pathology in severe COVID-19. With no treatments currently approved for COVID-19, therapeutics to prevent or treat the excessive inflammation in severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Here, in 10 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients we report profound elevation of plasma IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), decreased CD8\u002B T cell levels, and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Following compassionate care treatment with the CCR5 blocking antibody leronlimab, we observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy on macrophage and T cells, rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Consistent with reduction of plasma IL-6, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed declines in transcriptomic myeloid cell clusters expressing IL-6 and interferon-related genes. These results demonstrate a novel approach to resolving unchecked inflammation, restoring immunologic deficiencies, and reducing SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load via disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis, and support randomized clinical trials to assess clinical efficacy of leronlimab-mediated inhibition of CCR5 for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patterson, B.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID19 transmission and case fatality worldwide. Methods We assessed SARS CoV2 virus transmission and COVID19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all continents of the globe. Data from the COVID19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize the incidence data. Disease spread, was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R0 package of R statistical software was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted by taking the R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID19. The proportion of deaths to the total numbers of cases was meta analyzed using metaphor package of R statistical software using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio. Results We found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or population density. The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID19 cases. The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. An increase in the elderly population proportion by 1 percent was associated with an increase in CFR by 0.32. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age. Conclusion This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high risk groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID19.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Endailalu, T.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Favipiravir and baloxavir acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544). Results: Baloxavir showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 M comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir did not demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 M.

From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a \u201Ccytokine storm,\u201D is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients. Methods We investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature. Results Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks. Conclusions This study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Xiaohan; Wei, Xiyi; Li, Guangyao; Ren, Shancheng; Chen, Xinglin; Zhang, Tongtong; Zhang, Xu; Lu, Zhongwen; You, Zebing; Wang, Shangqian; Qin, Chao; Song, Ninghong; Wang, Zengjun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/622ccf742b9309da5f04c72672e9e61a6c0eec62.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.083618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gene Set Enrichment Analysis"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["expression pattern of ACE2","ACE2 specific signature","cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2","TMPRSS2","Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2","SARS-CoV","single cells","renal endothelial cells","human testis","pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS","cytokine receptors","increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines","spermatogonial stem cells","specific disease conditions","results","chronic kidney diseases","novel coronavirus","human body","single-cell RNA sequencing","cytokine storm","major organs","multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","genitourinary organs","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","renal proximal tubules","occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms","GSEA","different species","cellular infection","Gene Set Enrichment Analysis","pivotal entry molecules","new insights","individuals","urinary tract","macrophages","autoimmune attacks","scRNA-seq","diabetic nephropathy","Additional biological relevance","study","IL6ST","clinical manifestations","Conclusions","development of effective treatments","published evidence","gametocytes","animal susceptibility","Methods","Wuhan","China","ill patients","observations","Background"],"language":"en"},

During the first stage of the epidemic, growth rate charts revealed the UK, Italy and Spain as outliers, with differentially increasing growth of deaths over cases. A novel data-driven time-series model was then used to near-cast 7-day future cases and deaths with much greater precision. Finally, an epidemio-statistical model was used to bridge from near-casting to forecasting the future course of the global epidemic. By applying multiple approaches to global SARS-COV-2 data, coupled with mixed-effects methods, countries further ahead in the epidemic provide valuable information for those behind. Using current daily global data, we note convergence in near-term predictions for Italy signifying an appropriate call on the future course of the global epidemic.

Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as a decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process. The aim of this work is twofold. First, a quantitative analysis where we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and proposed a simple CNN architecture with less parameters and computational power that can perform as good as Xception and DenseNet architectures if trained on small dataset of chest X-ray images. Secondly, a qualitative investigation to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM). Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed most to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating regions in the input image. Chest X-ray images used in this work are coming from multiple sources which comprises of 154 confirmed COVID-19 images and over 5000 X-rays of normal, bacterial and other viral (non-COVID-19) infections. We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration until radiologist/clinicians can visually inspect the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction.

Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (\u201Cmargination\u201D). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myerson, Jacob W.; Patel, Priyal N.; Habibi, Nahal; Walsh, Landis R.; Lee, Yi-Wei; Luther, David C.; Ferguson, Laura T.; Zaleski, Michael H.; Zamora, Marco E.; Marcos-Contreras, Oscar A.; Glassman, Patrick M.; Johnston, Ian; Hood, Elizabeth D.; Shuvaeva, Tea; Gregory, Jason V.; Kiseleva, Raisa Y.; Nong, Jia; Rubey, Kathryn M.; Greineder, Colin F.; Mitragotri, Samir; Worthen, George S.; Rotello, Vincent M.; Lahann, Joerg; Muzykantov, Vladimir R.; Brenner, Jacob S.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc89e35678f856eb6512f872785f1a0baf8ab901.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.037564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary neutrophils","protein nanoparticles","NAPs","pulmonary marginated neutrophils","biodistribution of nanoparticles","library of nanoparticles","inflamed lungs","pulmonary capillaries","pulmonary edema","Acute lung inflammation","acute lung injury","massive accumulation of neutrophils","agglutinated protein","human lungs","engineering protein-conjugated liposomes","supramolecular organization of protein","symmetric structure","naive mice","significant potential","translational potential","structure-dependent interactions","SPECT imaging","severe morbidity","neutrophil extravasation","viral capsids","uptake","respiratory conditions","screen of biodistributions","finding","COVID","work","infections","ischemic ex","lipopolysaccharides","margination","nanostructural properties","patients"],"language":"en"},

Summary Objective To describe the profile and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) reported with Prevenar 13\u00AE since its commercialization. Method Analysis of all adverse events reported with Prevenar 13\u00AE in France between 1st July 2010 and 31 October 2014. Results In 4 years and 4 months, 376 AEs, including 252 severe (67%), were recorded, 83 of which occurred following an injection of Prevenar 13\u00AE alone: 39 cutaneous AEs, 16 neurological AEs, four cases of collapse or shock, nine cases of fever, and one of thrombocytopenia. For the serious AEs, the outcome was favorable in 88% of cases and none of the 12 reported deaths were attributed to a side effect of vaccination. Fifty-nine cases of pneumococcal disease that suggest an ineffective vaccine were reported, but only 16 can be considered as a real failure of the vaccination. Discussion In many cases, Prevenar 13\u00AE was administered on the same day as a hexavalent vaccine with which the AEs reported were expected. The profile of AEs reported following Prevenar 13\u00AE alone is similar to that seen with Prevenar 7\u00AE.

Abstract Introduction There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mat\u00EDas-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.

In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65*109/L vs. 0.76*109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duan, Kai; Liu, Bende; Li, Cesheng; Zhang, Huajun; Yu, Ting; Qu, Jieming; Zhou, Min; Chen, Li; Meng, Shengli; Hu, Yong; Peng, Cheng; Yuan, Mingchao; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Zejun; Yu, Jianhong; Gao, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Dan; Yu, Xiaoqi; Li, Li; Zhang, Jiayou; Wu, Xiao; Li, Bei; Yu, Yanping; Chen, Wei; Peng, Yan; Hu, Yeqin; Lin, Lianzhen; Liu, Xuefei; Huang, Shihe; Zhou, Zhijun; Zhang, Lianghao; Wang, Yue; Zhang, Zhi; Deng, Kun; Xia, Zhiwu; Gong, Qin; Zhang, Wei; Zheng, Xiaobei; Liu, Ying; Yang, Huichuan; Zhou, Dongbo; Yu, Ding; Hou, Jifeng; Shi, Zhengli; Chen, Saijuan; Chen, Zhu; Zhang, Xin-xin; Yang, Xiaoming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bd918c5102ace400552417aef81dec050636553.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of CP transfusion","days","pre-transfusion","clinical benefit of CP therapy","severe patients","cases","severe COVID","neutralizing viremia","clinical outcomes","improvement of clinical symptoms","level of neutralizing antibody","neutralizing antibody titers","study","severe adverse effects","approved specific antiviral agents","laboratory parameters","time point","viral load","previous viremia","median time","optimal dose","high level","increased lymphocyte counts","real-time viral RNA test","varying degrees of absorption","novel coronavirus disease","investigation","maximal supportive care","onset of illness","lung lesionswithin","addition","larger well-controlled trials","Radiological examinations","donors","primary endpoint","increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation","decreased C-reactive protein","endpoints","convalescent plasma"],"language":"en"},

Summary Introduction Viral respiratory infections are common in children, most of which are due to a virus. They can lead to serious infections, and these children may require treatment in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This prospective study evaluated the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and associated illnesses among children hospitalized in a PICU during the three winter months of 2012\u20132013. Methods All the children admitted to the PICU, University Hospital of Caen, France, were included. Nasal swabs were collected and specimens were tested using a single real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Results Of the 105 patients admitted to the PICU during the study period, 84 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The \u201Crespiratory group\u201D included 37 patients with respiratory symptoms at admission while the \u201Cnonrespiratory group\u201D included 47 patients with no respiratory symptoms. The 84 nasal swabs collected included 54 that were considered positive (64.3%) and 70 viruses were detected. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n =28; 40.0% positive samples), followed by HRV (n =24; 34.3%). Viruses were more frequently detected in the respiratory (86.5%) than in the nonrespiratory (42.6%) group (P \u003C0.001). Statistical analysis by subgroups revealed that RSV infections were significantly more frequent in the respiratory group (54.1%) than in the nonrespiratory group (6.4%) (P \u003C0.001). There was no difference for HRV (32.4% and 27.7%) or for the other viruses. No difference in duration of hospitalization or duration of mechanical ventilation was demonstrated depending on the virus detected. Discussion The use of the very sensitive multiplex PCR technique increased virus detection rates in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion We have confirmed the frequency of RSV infections in a PICU and found that many patients without respiratory symptoms have respiratory infections caused by viruses. The impact of these infections on patient outcome should now be analyzed in order to demonstrate the role played by respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mortamet, G.; Morello, R.; Jokic, M.; Vabret, A.; Leroux, M.; Brouard, J.; Dina, J.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f60a18092c9596fed480a4e872150912bf3f9215.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X14005181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X14005181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Elle sugg\u00E8re"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["detected virus","virus chez","virus respiratoires chez","virus dont","virus d\u00E9tect\u00E9s","respiratory symptoms","enfants et","epidemiology of respiratory viruses","virus respiratoire syncytial","ou plusieurs virus","enfants en r\u00E9animation p\u00E9diatrique","par PCR","PICU","virus detection rates","enfants pr\u00E9sentaient","enfants admis en r\u00E9animation p\u00E9diatrique","enfants sans sympt\u00F4mes respiratoires","serious infections","Summary Introduction Viral respiratory infections","children","patients","nonrespiratory group","frequency of RSV infections","sympt\u00F4mes respiratoires \u00E0 leur admission en unit\u00E9","ces infections virales \u00E0 l\u2019admission","virus respiratoire \u00E0 partir d\u2019un pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement nasal analys\u00E9 par amplification g\u00E9nique","ou plusieurs sympt\u00F4mes respiratoires \u00E0 l\u2019admission","r\u00E9animation et soins continus","\u00E9taient infect\u00E9s par","enfants hospitalis\u00E9s dans une unit\u00E9","Nasal swabs","b\u00E9n\u00E9fice \u00E0 l\u2019extension","ventilation m\u00E9canique n\u2019a \u00E9t\u00E9 mise en \u00E9vidence en fonction","cette \u00E9tude prospective \u00E9tait d\u2019\u00E9valuer l\u2019\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie","Caen et ayant b\u00E9n\u00E9fici\u00E9 d\u2019une recherche d\u2019infection par","notamment chez","pr\u00E9valence \u00E9tait","plan respiratoire","plus \u00E9lev\u00E9e \u00E9tait","Cette \u00E9tude r\u00E9v\u00E8le cependant","single real-time PCR","sensitive multiplex PCR technique","prospective study","difference","HRV","taux \u00E9lev\u00E9 d\u2019infections respiratoires caus\u00E9es","duration of mechanical ventilation","soins continus p\u00E9diatriques pendant","Ont \u00E9t\u00E9 inclus tous","dur\u00E9e d\u2019hospitalisation","duration of hospitalization","study period","positive samples","sujets asymptomatiques sur","University Hospital of Caen","Cinquante-quatre \u00E9chantillons \u00E9taient positifs","ne pr\u00E9sentent pas","d\u00E9tection","CHU","d\u00E9pistage","centre hospitalier universitaire","mesures d\u2019isolement","sensible que d\u2019autres m\u00E9thodes","int\u00E9r\u00EAt","mois d\u2019hiver","pediatric intensive care unit","associated illnesses","treatment","polymerase chain reaction","r\u00E9pondaient aux crit\u00E8res d\u2019inclusion","VRS","specimens","avec","subgroups","Parmi","asymptomatic subjects","Elle sugg\u00E8re","Aucune diff\u00E9rence","patient outcome","Statistical analysis","principale limite","France","impact","Trente","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","role","inclusion criteria","order","Discussion","suivi","rhinovirus","winter months","Conclusion","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients\u0027 self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19. Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohn\u0027s disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ[\u2265]50). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009).

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. Results: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p\u003C0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. Conclusion: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Zhou, Liangcai; Prosper, Olivia; Luo, Wei; Floyd, Jessica R; Wesolowski, Amy; Santillana, Mauricio; Zhang, Chi; Du, Xiangjun; Yu, Hongjie; Tatem, Andrew J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1008925754f127b74ab07e83fd64c0260b980a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Baidu","NPI"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["integrated NPIs","mainland China","early case detection","efficacy of different candidate NPIs","number of cases","weeks","early stage of outbreak","early detection","relative effect of various NPIs","isolation of cases","number of COVID","daily reported case numbers","fold increase","outbreak containment strategies","intensity of travel restrictions","contact reductions","travel network","improvement of case identification","effectiveness of different interventions","reported incidence","model","number of affected areas","World","IQR","Results","non-pharmaceutical interventions","integrated NPI strategies","affected regions","rapid effect","Baidu location-based service","daily changes of delay","social distancing intervention","timings","illness onset","real time human movement data","future responses","economic impacts","epidemics","Wuhan","infections","emerging disease","R2","proxy","interquartile range","outputs","cities","series of sensitivity analyses","health","epidemiological parameters","SEIR","county","transmission","months","Methods","total","Background","Conclusion","Quantitative research","spread"],"language":"en"},

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawalha, A.

By the morning of 14 April 2020, 199 patients had been discharged (Female 89, Male 111), 163 patients had died (female 61, male 102) and 131 remained as in-patients (female 66, male 71). Fewer than one in twenty deaths occurred in patients below the age of 50 years, in either gender. Mortality rose dramatically, for both genders, after the age of sixty with males being almost twice as vulnerable to dying, as females, during the 7th decade. Males older than their mid-fifties were more likely to die than leave hospital. The same applied to females beyond their mid seventies. We did not see any evidence of a poorer outcome associated with a lower decile for Index of Multiple Deprivation or convincing evidence that any Ethnic minority groups were more likely to die than the White subgroups. When compared to the equivalent medical conditions, normally treated in the early spring, COVID-19 has an increased mortality, adversely affecting more men and an older population. The mean duration from admission to discharge was 11.29 days (SD 11.50 days). For admission to death, the mean interval was 11.72 days (SD 11.05 days). 62 of the 500 admissions required ventilator support. Of this subgroup, 71% were male and 29% were female. By the morning of the 14 April, no female over the age of 60 had left the intensive care unit alive and no male over the age of 50 had left the intensive care unit alive. At this time-point, 1.2% of the 500 admitted patients had returned alive from the intensive care units, following a period of ventilator support. This figure will rise if prolonged ventilator and renal support proves effective. While only providing a snapshot of a relatively small number of patients, reviewed over a short time period, from a small geographic area, the data supports the view that the younger members of society are less vulnerable to the adverse sequelae of COVID-19 infection and that any return to normal work and social activities should be considered initially for the individuals who are less than 40-50 years of age. There is an ongoing need for analyses on larger patient cohorts using both demographic and detailed clinical data.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Field, R.

The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Newby, J.; O\u0027Moore, K.; Tang, S.; Christensen, H.; Faasse, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c327f381654ddb6686ff3566d365986eda65ce8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.20089961v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Torres Strait"],"keyphrases":["mental health of respondents","mental health needs","acute mental health responses","prior mental health diagnosis","long-term mental health impacts","reporting elevated health anxiety","prior history of mental health problems","long-term predictors of poor mental health","accessible digital mental health services","higher distress","anxiety levels","serious acute impact of COVID","perceived risk of contracting COVID","higher stress","pandemic","Rates of elevated psychological distress","severity of psychological distress","higher engagement","elevated depression","stress levels","contamination fears","self-reported history","Australia","Results","outbreak","hygiene behaviours","previous research","behavioural responses","precautionary behaviours","Longitudinal research","adult participants","Self-report questionnaires","different gender identity","Torres Strait Islander status","alcohol use","contrast","people","past week","current study","hand sanitiser","social events","hands","peak","financial worries","physical activity","online survey","Uncertainty","loneliness","carer","home parent","factors","Demographic","family","friends","quarter","half"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical records of cases of AKI who required haemodialysis support during the time period from August 1, 2013 to February 1, 2015 was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 151 cases AKI requiring dialysis were included for the study. Overall, the patients were generally younger with a mean age of 36.7 years and thus with few premorbid conditions. The most common causes of AKI were hypovolemia (22.5 %), acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) (21.9 %) and pregnancy related causes (18.5 %). Nearly a third (29.1 %) of patients succumbed to the AKI. CONCLUSION: Infections, AGN, obstetric causes and nephrotoxins were the primary causes of dialysis requiring AKI. Most of these causes can be prevented with simple interventions such as health education on oral rehydration, quality prenatal and emergency obstetric care, appropriate management of infections and taking appropriate precautions when prescribing potentially nephrotoxic medications.","publish_time":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ibrahim, Ahmed; Ahmed, Momina M.; Kedir, Seman; Bekele, Delayehu","journal":"BMC Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32882032310b4aad40a9ed6faa0fe3234a69ed23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4957374.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4957374/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Saint Paul\u2019s Hospital Millennium Medical College","AKI"],"locations":["Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["cases AKI","common causes of AKI","obstetric causes","primary causes of dialysis","dialysis center of SPHMMC","pregnancy related causes","sustainable dialysis unit","AGN","unique cohort of patients","study","appropriate management of infections","appropriate precautions","clinical profile","haemodialysis support","intermittent haemodialysis","acute glomerulonephritis","retrospective review of clinical records of cases","emergency obstetric care","outcome of adult Acute Kidney Injury","quality prenatal","Ethiopia","oral rehydration","Saint Paul\u2019s Hospital Millennium Medical College","health education","nephrotoxins","simple interventions","years","government","total","hypovolemia","mean age","nephrotoxic medications","time period","METHODS","development","CONCLUSION","premorbid conditions","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying each event is necessary for the intervention of virus infection in human healthcare and agriculture. Here we report the visualization of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) assembly in the medaka haploid embryonic stem (ES) cell line HX1. SGIV is a highly infectious DNA virus that causes a massive loss in marine aquaculture. Ectopic expression of VP88GFP, a fusion between green fluorescent protein and the envelope protein VP088, did not compromise the ES cell properties and susceptibility to SGIV infection. Although VP88GFP disperses evenly in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells, it undergoes aggregation and redistribution in SGIV-infected cells. Real-time visualization revealed multiple key stages of VP88GFP redistribution and the dynamics of viral assembly site (VAS). Specifically, VP88GFP entry into and condensation in the VAS occurred within a 6-h duration, a similar duration was observed also for the release of VP88GFP-containing SGIV out of the cell. Taken together, VP088 is an excellent marker for visualizing the SGIV infection process. Our results provide new insight into macromolecular component recruitment and SGIV assembly.

The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases. Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity. This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia. Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination. RESULTS: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years. Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0\u20130.01 %) between the isolates. No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates. No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist. Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that FHV-1 genomes are highly conserved. The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses. The SNPs detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of FHV-1 in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies.

There was a significant weight loss in KO mice at Day 2 and significantly higher disease scores during the 7 days of observation. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in the serum were significantly higher in KO mice at Day 2. In KO mice there were a significantly higher lung injury score, higher wet/dry lung weight ratio, more apoptotic cells and less proliferative cells in the lung. Macrophage infiltration was significantly elevated in the lung of KO mice. There was significantly increased number of p-GSK-3\u03B2 positive cells in KO mice, which were mainly neutrophils and macrophages.

XB130 deficiency delayed the recovery from systemic septic responses, and the presence of XB130 in the alveolar epithelial cells may provide protective mechanisms by reducing cell death and promoting cell proliferation, and reducing pulmonary permeability.","publish_time":"2016-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toba, Hiroaki; Tomankova, Tereza; Wang, Yingchun; Bai, Xiaohui; Cho, Hae-Ra; Guan, Zhehong; Adeyi, Oyedele A.; Tian, Feng; Keshavjee, Shaf; Liu, Mingyao","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50ad279de0a3f825b6280e07afc79439f59ecc3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5041914.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung of KO mice","apoptotic cells","proliferative cells","presence of XB130","Xb130 knockout","XB130 deficiency","role of XB130","higher lung injury score","alveolar epithelial cells","acute lung injury","\u03B2 positive cells","dry lung weight ratio","cell proliferation","alveolar type","higher disease scores","cell death","wild type","interleukin","LPS challenge","cancer cell survival","systemic septic responses","significant weight loss","monocyte chemoattractant protein","GSK","levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha","protective mechanisms","novel oncoprotein","recovery","migration","lipopolysaccharide","WT","increased number of p","serum","days of observation","pulmonary permeability","neutrophils","physiological function","study","Macrophage infiltration","objective","macrophages","expression"],"language":"en"},

First, the areas of interest of the chest are found using template matching on the images. Then, a texture descriptor called local binary patterns (LBP) is computed for those areas. After that, LBP histograms are applied in a classifier algorithm, which produces the final normality/pathology decision. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposal, with success rates above 87% in the best cases.

The study herds were selected from farrow-to-finish herds (n=99) that entered in the PigINFO system between July 2013 and March 2015. From 1 April to 30 June 2014 (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on polymerase chain reaction analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining were defined as PED-positive (n=38). They were further classified into those with long PED periods (L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with short PED periods (S-PED-positive; n=10). Herds with no clinical signs of PED were classified as PED-negative (n=61). Herd-level production data, including preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter, litters per mated female per year and pigs marketed per sow (MP), were calculated every 3 months during study period. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than PED-negative herds, and L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL. During October\u2013December 2014, L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than PED-negative herds. The PED outbreak increased mortality and consequently reduced the numbers of marketed pigs. The rapid control of an outbreak is important for reducing the financial losses arising from PED infections.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"YAMANE, Itsuro; YAMAZAKI, Hisanori; ISHIZEKI, Sayoko; WATANABE, Yugo; OKUMURA, Hanako; OKUBO, Mitsuharu; KURE, Katsumasa; HAYAKAWA, Yuiko; FURUKAWA, Makoto; OOI, Munetaka; MIZUKAMI, Yoshihiro; ITO, Mitsugu","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ff336c5f099acbe84cf7cfe5f68bd5ba672d6b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5059364.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED","PRWM","POWM","PWL"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["PED-positive herds","PED epidemic","S-PED","PED-negative herds","PED infections","clinical signs of PED","short PED periods","long PED periods","PED outbreak increased mortality","study herds","finish herds","feces positive","numbers of marketed pigs","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","POWM","preweaning mortality","postweaning mortality","PigINFO system","Herd-level production data","herd-level productivity","data recording system","higher PRWM","fewer MP","lower PWL","study period","PEDV","polymerase chain reaction analysis","litters","mated female","year","immunohistochemical staining","financial losses","effects","farrow","rapid control","Japan","sow","objective","months"],"language":"en"},

Despite recent advances in a range of omics analyses, multi-omic measurements of the same sample are still challenging and current methods have not been well evaluated in terms of reproducibility and broad applicability. Here we adapted a solvent-based method, widely applied for extracting lipids and metabolites, to add proteomics to mass spectrometry-based multi-omics measurements. The metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx) protocol proved to be robust and applicable to a diverse set of sample types, including cell cultures, microbial communities, and tissues. To illustrate the utility of this protocol, an integrative multi-omics analysis was performed using a lung epithelial cell line infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which showed the impact of this virus on the host glycolytic pathway and also suggested a role for lipids during infection. The MPLEx method is a simple, fast, and robust protocol that can be applied for integrative multi-omic measurements from diverse sample types (e.g., environmental, in vitro, and clinical). IMPORTANCE In systems biology studies, the integration of multiple omics measurements (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) has been shown to provide a more complete and informative view of biological pathways. Thus, the prospect of extracting different types of molecules (e.g., DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and metabolites) and performing multiple omics measurements on single samples is very attractive, but such studies are challenging due to the fact that the extraction conditions differ according to the molecule type. Here, we adapted an organic solvent-based extraction method that demonstrated broad applicability and robustness, which enabled comprehensive proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics analyses from the same sample.

In this study, using a mouse model, we compared the host response associated with PB1-F2 with an early transcriptomic signature that was previously associated with neutrophils and consecutively fatal IAV infections. This allowed us to show that PB1-F2 is partly involved in neutrophil-related mechanisms leading to death. Using neutropenic mice, we confirmed that the harmful effect of PB1-F2 is due to an excessive inflammation mediated by an increased neutrophil mobilization. We identified the downstream effects of this PB1-F2-exacerbated neutrophil recruitment. PB1-F2 had no impact on the lymphocyte recruitment in the airways at day 8 pi. However, functional genomics analysis and flow cytometry in broncho-alveolar lavages at 4 days pi revealed that PB1-F2 induced a NK cells deficiency. Thus, our results identify PB1-F2 as an important immune disruptive factor during the IAV infection.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vidy, Aurore; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Da Costa, Bruno; Delmas, Bernard; Chevalier, Christophe; Le Goffic, Ronan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9db44eda8b352d1e7e5f73d7b5587659aa256151.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5087861.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PB1-F2 protein","harmful effect of PB1","neutrophil recruitment","fatal IAV infections","increased neutrophil mobilization","neutrophil-related mechanisms","virulence factor","days pi","lymphocyte recruitment","important immune disruptive factor","flow cytometry","broncho-alveolar lavages","pathogenesis","functional genomics analysis","excessive inflammation","host response","airways","neutrophils","early transcriptomic signature","impact","virus","mouse model","NK cells deficiency","death","mammals","influenza","downstream effects","study","results","neutropenic mice"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The study admitted 285 patients with confirmed EVD and followed them up till the endpoint (recovery or death). EVD was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR assays detecting blood Ebola virus (EBOV). RESULTS: Among the 285 lab-confirmed EVD cases in Jui Government Hospital, 146 recovered and 139 died, with an overall survival rate of 51.23 %. Patients under the age of 6 years had a lower survival rate (37.50 %). Most non-survivors (79.86 %) died within 7 days after admission and the mean hospitalization time for non-survivors was 5.56 \u00B1 6.11 days. More than half survivors (63.69 %) turned blood EBOV negative within 3 weeks after admission and the mean hospitalization time for survivors was 20.38 \u00B1 7.58 days. High blood viral load (\u226510(6) copies/ml) was found to be predictive of the non-survival outcome as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The probability of patients\u2019 survival was less than 15 % when blood viral load was greater than 10(6) copies/ml. Multivariate analyses showed that blood viral load (P = 0.005), confusion (P = 0.010), abdominal pain (P = 0.003), conjunctivitis (P = 0.035), and vomiting (P = 0.004) were factors independently associated with the outcomes of EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most death occurred within 1 week after admission, and patients at the age of 6 or younger had a lower survival rate. Most surviving patients turned blood EBOV negative within 1\u20134 weeks after admission. Factors such as high blood viral load, confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting and conjunctivitis were associated with poor prognosis for EVD patients.

Activation of type I IFN signaling pathway leads to expressions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) which play important roles in antiviral and immunomodulatory responses to HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our previous studies indicated that ISG15 and its conjugation (ISGylation) were exploited by HCV to benefit its replication and persistent infection. This study was designed to assess the role of ISG15 and ISGylation in HBV infection in vitro. The levels of ISG15 and ISGylation were upregulated by ISG15 plasmid transfection into HepG2.2.15 cells. Decreased ISGylation was achieved by siRNA targeting UBE1L, the only E1 activating enzyme for ISGylation. Overexpression of ISG15 and subsequent ISGylation significantly increased the levels of HBV DNA in the culture supernatants although the intracellular viral replication remained unaffected. Silencing UBE1L, with decreased ISGylation achieved, abrogated this ISGylation-mediated promoting effect. Our data indicated that overexpression of ISG15 stimulated HBV production in an ISGylation-dependent manner. Identification of ISG15-conjugated proteins (either HBV viral or host proteins) may reveal promising candidates for further antiviral drug development.","publish_time":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yujia; Li, Shilin; Duan, Xiaoqiong; Chen, Yanzhao; Jiao, Baihai; Ye, Haiyan; Yao, Min; Chen, Limin","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05e9af5c04c17b89fd8d65d62a381eb22e8316ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5102744.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Decreased ISGylation","subsequent ISGylation","HBV infection","levels of ISG15","HBV viral","role of ISG15","Identification of ISG15","ISGylation-dependent manner","overexpression of ISG15 stimulated HBV production","levels of HBV DNA","ISG15 plasmid transfection","hepatitis C virus","Hepatitis B virus","expressions of IFN","HCV","persistent infection","important account of infectious hepatitis","intracellular viral replication","important roles","host proteins","conjugated proteins","stimulated genes","Silencing UBE1L","antiviral drug development","immunomodulatory responses","culture supernatants","promising candidates","pathway","ISGs","interferon","HepG2","siRNA","cells","Activation of type","enzyme","data","conjugation","previous studies","best treatment options","study","effect"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 19 patients diagnosed with adenovirus pneumonia at a tertiary referral center, in the period between March 2003 and April 2015. Clinical findings were reviewed, and two radiologists assessed imaging findings by consensus. Chi-square, Fisher\u0027s exact, and Student\u0027s t tests were used for comparing patients with and without subsequent development of ARDS. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, nine were immunocompromised, and 10 were immunocompetent. Twelve patients (63%) progressed to ARDS, six of whom (32%) eventually died from the disease. The average time for progression to ARDS from symptom onset was 9.6 days. Initial chest radiographic findings were normal (n = 2), focal opacity (n = 9), or multifocal or diffuse opacity (n = 8). Computed tomography (CT) findings included bilateral (n = 17) or unilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacity with consolidation (n = 14) or pleural effusion (n = 11). Patients having subsequent ARDS had a higher probability of pleural effusion and a higher total CT extent compared with the non-ARDS group (p = 0.010 and 0.007, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in clinical variables such as patient age and premorbid condition. CONCLUSION: Adenovirus pneumonia demonstrates high rates of ARDS and mortality, regardless of patient age and premorbid conditions, in the tertiary care setting. Large disease extent and presence of pleural effusion on CT are factors suggestive of progression to ARDS.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cha, Min Jae; Chung, Myung Jin; Lee, Kyung Soo; Kim, Tae Jung; Kim, Tae Sung; Chong, Semin; Han, Jungho","journal":"Korean J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49d10e98d15b16cd6d0b522b21714401d767dcc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5102922.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["ARDS","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","subsequent ARDS","subsequent development of ARDS","radiologic findings of adenovirus pneumonia","Clinical findings","high rates of ARDS","non-ARDS group","imaging findings","presence of pleural effusion","higher probability of pleural effusion","higher total CT extent","patient age","suggestive of progression","Initial chest radiographic findings","diffuse opacity","focal opacity","Large disease extent","ground-glass opacity","premorbid conditions","clinical variables","tertiary referral center","tertiary care setting","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Fisher\u0027s exact","Student\u0027s t tests","clinico-radiological features","mortality","symptom onset","CONCLUSION","consolidation","study","radiologists","significant differences","Computed tomography","average time","Chi-square","period","consensus","METHODS","days","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In the past several years, the designs of many immunoaffinity reagents have focused on lowering costs and improving specificity while also promoting stability. Antibody fragments (scFvs) have long been displayed on the surface of yeast and phage libraries for selection; however, the stable production of such fragments presents challenges that hamper their widespread use in diagnostics. Membrane and cell wall proteins similarly suffer from stability problems when solubilized from their native environment. Recently, cell envelope compositions that maintain membrane proteins in native or native-like lipid environment to improve their stability have been developed. This cell envelope composition approach has now been adapted toward stabilizing antibody fragments by retaining their native cell wall environment. A new class of immunoaffinity reagents has been developed that maintains antibody fragment attachment to yeast cell wall. Herein, we review recent strategies that incorporate cell wall fragments with functional scFvs, which are designed for easy production while maintaining specificity and stability when in use with simple detection platforms. These cell wall based antibody fragments are globular in structure, and heterogeneous in size, with fragments ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. These fragments appear to retain activity once immobilized onto biosensor surfaces for the specific and sensitive detection of pathogen antigens. They can be quickly and economically generated from a yeast display library and stored lyophilized, at room temperature, for up to a year with little effect on stability. This new format of scFvs provides stability, in a simple and low-cost manner toward the use of scFvs in biosensor applications. The production and \u201Cpanning\u201D of such antibody cell wall composites are also extremely facile, enabling the rapid adoption of stable and inexpensive affinity reagents for emerging infectious threats.","publish_time":"2016-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grewal, Yadveer S.; Shiddiky, Muhammad J.

Vaccination (using an inactivated rabies vaccine), combined with administration of rabies immune globulin, is the only approved, effective method for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies in humans. In the search for novel rabies control and treatment strategies, live-attenuated viruses have recently emerged as a practical and promising approach for immunizing and controlling rabies. Unlike the conventional, inactivated rabies vaccine, live-attenuated viruses are genetically modified viruses that are able to replicate in an inoculated recipient without causing adverse effects, while still eliciting robust and effective immune responses against rabies virus infection. A number of viruses with an intrinsic capacity that could be used as putative candidates for live-attenuated rabies vaccine have been intensively evaluated for therapeutic purposes. Additional novel strategies, such as a monoclonal antibody-based approach, nucleic acid-based vaccines, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) interfering with virus replication, could further add to the arena of strategies to combat rabies. In this review, we highlight current advances in rabies therapy and discuss the role that they might have in the future of rabies treatment. Given the pronounced and complex impact of rabies on a patient, a combination of these novel modalities has the potential to achieve maximal anti-rabies efficacy, or may even have promising curative effects in the future. However, several hurdles regarding clinical safety considerations and public awareness should be overcome before these approaches can ultimately become clinically relevant therapies.","publish_time":"2016-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Shimao; Guo, Caiping","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4abc50cfc81265083d4cb2aed0a493bb704d0b5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5127009.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127009/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rabies therapy","inactivated rabies vaccine","novel rabies control","future of rabies treatment","live-attenuated rabies vaccine","rabies virus infection","complex impact of rabies","administration of rabies immune globulin","maximal anti-rabies efficacy","attenuated viruses","treatment strategies","modified viruses","number of viruses","Additional novel strategies","promising approach","novel modalities","arena of strategies","effective immune responses","promising curative effects","monoclonal antibody-based approach","effective method","adverse effects","virus replication","small interfering RNAs","nucleic acid-based vaccines","post-exposure prophylaxis","potential","public awareness","clinical safety considerations","siRNAs","patient","putative candidates","neurological disease","hurdles","inoculated recipient","current advances","humans","combination","immunizing","search","intrinsic capacity","approaches","Vaccination","relevant therapies","kinds of mammals","review","role","therapeutic purposes"],"language":"en"},

Conventional monolayer cell cultures may support viral infection, but are unable to form the tissue structures and complex microenvironments that mimic host physiology and, therefore, limiting their translational utility. The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor was designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to model microgravity and was later found to more accurately reproduce features of human tissue in vivo. Cells grown in RWV bioreactors develop in a low fluid-shear environment, which enables cells to form complex 3D tissue-like aggregates.

METHODS: We compared seven published real-time RT\u2013PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed. To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays\u2019 target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains. Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays. FINDINGS: Oligonucleotides of the published real-time RT\u2013PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays. The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction. Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples. The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5 \u00D7 10(4) RNA copies/mL of blood and 2 \u00D7 10(4) RNA copies/mL of urine. CONCLUSION: We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains. Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains. Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corman, Victor M; Rasche, Andrea; Baronti, Cecile; Aldabbagh, Souhaib; Cadar, Daniel; Reusken, Chantal BEM; Pas, Suzan D; Goorhuis, Abraham; Schinkel, Janke; Molenkamp, Richard; K\u00FCmmerer, Beate M; Bleicker, Tobias; Br\u00FCnink, Sebastian; Eschbach-Bludau, Monika; Eis-H\u00FCbinger, Anna M; Koopmans, Marion P; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Grobusch, Martin P; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix","journal":"Bull World Health Organ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ba9bd26567dc15bc9a0abf88342604d62e336ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5153932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR assays","published assays","new assays","Zika virus detection suitable","Asian Zika virus strains","Zika virus-infected patients","use of insensitive assays","uncRNA copies","spiked samples","published real-time RT","lower detection limit","technical detection limit","clinical samples","current outbreak strains","RNA strand","urine","limited sensitivity","similar sensitivity","mean viral loads","Viral concentrations","analytical sensitivity","potential mismatches","spiked human blood","polymerase chain reaction","Asian lineage","potential incompatibility","lower sensitivities","diagnostic performance of real-time reverse transcription","known quantities of African","updated protocols","synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid","reagents","assays\u2019 target regions","false-negative results","Oligonucleotides","FINDINGS","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction for these types of stochastic models remain limited. In this manuscript, we describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. Using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, we evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. We show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters (i.e. mean duration of infectiousness, R(0), and R(eff)) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods: 1) a likelihood approximation with an assumption of independent Poisson observations; 2) a particle filtering method; and 3) an ensemble Kalman filter method. We find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these three benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. In summary, MSS is a promising method that may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics.","publish_time":"2017-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmer, Christoph; Yaesoubi, Reza; Cohen, Ted","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8640647aeb5d12e17f9fce436b6548f68c80dba2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/68daf58b8957645121d653fcecec61447d573bb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5240920.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accurate prediction","stochastic models of epidemics","accuracy of MSS","performance of MSS","types of stochastic models","prediction framework","Stochastic systems","Stochastic transmission dynamic models","stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics","proposed method","promising method","unobserved number of infectious individuals","number of new diagnosed cases","calibration","accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters","state-of-the-art benchmark methods","particle filtering method","majority of epidemic scenarios","true epidemic state","ensemble Kalman filter method","real-time parameter estimation","likelihood approximation","novel viral pathogen","new surveillance observation","linear noise approximation","early emergence of novel pathogens","belief","timing of future hospitalizations","importance of chance events","Multiple Shooting","mean duration of infectiousness","assumption of independent Poisson observations","current approaches","overall attack rate","size","simulated outbreaks","course","weekly counts","fluctuations","summary","imperfect proxy of incidence","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

About 80% of Ethiopians are dependent on agriculture and have direct contact with livestock or other domestic animals. As a result, the country is vulnerable to the spread of zoonotic diseases. As the first step of the country\u0027s engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda, a zoonotic disease prioritization workshop was held to identify significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern for animal and human health agencies. METHODS: A semi-quantitative tool developed by the US CDC was used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases. Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion. RESULTS: Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis. DISCUSSION: Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.","publish_time":"2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pieracci, Emily G.; Hall, Aron J.; Gharpure, Radhika; Haile, Abraham; Walelign, Elias; Deressa, Asefa; Bahiru, Getahun; Kibebe, Meron; Walke, Henry; Ermias Belay","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ed0c79fde1a2d37093e6a97ee3ffb2d8c4410eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5315415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315415/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health Security Agenda","US CDC","Zoonotic Disease Unit"],"locations":["Africa","Ethiopia","East Africa"],"keyphrases":["prioritization of zoonotic diseases","priority zoonotic diseases","prioritized zoonotic diseases","spread of zoonotic diseases","emerging zoonotic diseases","zoonotic disease prioritization workshop","Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit","significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern","burden of animal disease","proportion of human disease","severity of disease","human health agencies","disease specific information","Workshop participants","disease surveillance system development","largest human population","animal exposure","environmental health ministries","Enhancement of public health","Global Health Security Agenda","humans","largest livestock population","criterion","RESULTS","core decision-making participants","surveillance activities","subsequent discussion","domestic animals","order of importance","Multi-sectoral collaborations","East Africa region","existing inter-sectoral collaboration","veterinary laboratories","joint outbreak","rabies","morbidity","anthrax","support implementation of prevention","decision tree analysis","direct contact","laboratory capacity","country\u0027s engagement","agriculture","mortality","DALYs","US CDC","intersectoral linkages","prevalence","brucellosis","semi-quantitative tool","control strategies","leptospirosis","final group weight","availability of interventions","METHODS","continent","Ethiopians","echinococcosis","step","Committee members","Criteria","BACKGROUND","creation","articles"],"language":"en"},

Nonetheless little is known on this matter due the lack of instruments for precise mobility quantification and study design difficulties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a cohort-nested, case-control study with 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with the goal of describing human mobility patterns of recently Dengue virus-infected subjects, and comparing them with those of non-infected subjects living in an urban endemic locality. Mobility was quantified using a GPS-data logger registering waypoints at 60-second intervals for a minimum of 15 natural days. RESULTS: Although absolute displacement was highly biased towards the intradomestic and peridomestic areas, occasional displacements exceeding a 100-Km radius from the center of the studied locality were recorded for all three study groups and individual displacements were recorded traveling across six states from central Mexico. Additionally, cases had a larger number of visits out of the municipality\u00B4s administrative limits when compared to intradomestic controls (cases: 10.4 versus intradomestic controls: 2.9, p = 0.0282). We were able to identify extradomestic places within and out of the locality that were independently visited by apparently non-related infected subjects, consistent with houses, working and leisure places. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show that human mobility in a small urban setting exceeded that considered by local health authority\u2019s administrative limits, and was different between recently infected and non-infected subjects living in the same household. These observations provide important insights about the role that human mobility may have in Dengue virus transmission and persistence across endemic geographic areas that need to be taken into account when planning preventive and control measures. Finally, these results are a valuable reference when setting the parameters for future mathematical modeling studies.","publish_time":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falc\u00F3n-Lezama, Jorge Abelardo; Santos-Luna, Ren\u00E9; Rom\u00E1n-P\u00E9rez, Susana; Mart\u00EDnez-Vega, Ruth Aral\u00ED; Herrera-Valdez, Marco Arieli; Kuri-Morales, \u00C1ngel Fernando; Adams, Ben; Kuri-Morales, Pablo Antonio; L\u00F3pez-Cervantes, Malaqu\u00EDas; Ramos-Casta\u00F1eda, Jos\u00E9","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff2b36ea32d849a577ae66637bbe359f108f35d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5321279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321279/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["intradomestic controls","non-infected subjects","Dengue virus-infected subjects","human mobility patterns","non-related infected subjects","cases","RESULTS","precise mobility quantification","Dengue virus transmission","study groups","population controls","case-control study","urban endemic locality","study design difficulties","studied locality","endemic geographic areas","small urban setting","important driver","field data","important insights","individual displacements","occasional displacements","peridomestic areas","Mathematical models","control measures","leisure places","extradomestic places","local health authority\u2019s administrative limits","GPS-data logger","future mathematical modeling studies","traveling","parameters","houses","persistence","lack of instruments","municipality","role","goal","individuals","waypoints","states","larger number of visits","cohort-nested","INTRODUCTION","valuable reference","absolute displacement","minimum","intervals","central Mexico","account","preventive","radius","observations","center","natural days","METHODS","matter","CONCLUSIONS","household","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe adenovirus infections in non-immunocompromised individuals remain unclear. Adenovirus pneumonia was associated with pleural effusion in a number of patients from the 2011 outbreak suggesting that similar to bacterial pneumonia, patients diagnosed with adenovirus pneumonia who have pleural effusion are more severely and systemically infected, and may have a more protracted disease course. We hypothesized that the host immunological response determines the severity of adenoviral infection. METHODS: This retrospective case series study included patients diagnosed with severe lower respiratory tract infections at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in southern Taiwan between December 2010 and October 2011. The main inclusion criteria were 1) presence of multifocal patchy infiltrates, lobar consolidation or reticular interstitial opacities in chest X-rays, and 2) presence of adenovirus isolated from respiratory specimens. All patients had adenovirus isolated from respiratory specimens, and were negative for other viruses. Pleural effusion was confirmed in all patients using chest echography. Clinical features and laboratory data were compared in patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 15) parapneumonic effusion. RESULTS: Presence of parapneumonic effusion was significantly associated with a longer febrile duration, more complicated clinical management, and a greater risk of extrapulmonary involvement, notably hepatitis. Patients without pleural effusion had significantly higher numbers of WBCs, platelets, and absolute segment cell counts (ASCs) compared to patients with pleural effusion (all p \u003C 0.05). Patients without pleural effusion had significantly higher counts of CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B, and CD20\u002B T cells (all p \u003C 0.05) compared to patients with pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that presence of parapneumonic effusion in adenoviral pneumonia was associated with longer febrile duration, more complicated clinical management, a greater risk of hepatitis, and suppression of host cellular immunity. Further prospective, large-scale studies are needed to validate our results.","publish_time":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Ching-Fen; Wang, Shih-Min; Ho, Tzong-Shiann; Liu, Ching-Chuan","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd6990c1480a98b0a0951ae0915a4759f1f94cdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5341368.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5341368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Cheng Kung University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pleural effusion","number of patients","Presence of parapneumonic effusion","presence of adenovirus","Adenovirus pneumonia","Human adenovirus","adenoviral pneumonia","pathogenesis of severe adenovirus infections","bacterial pneumonia","respiratory specimens","complicated clinical management","greater risk of hepatitis","febrile duration","Clinical features","RESULTS","severe lower respiratory tract infections","presence of multifocal patchy infiltrates","higher counts of CD4","greater risk of extrapulmonary involvement","southern Taiwan","chest X-rays","community outbreak","laboratory data","chest echography","higher numbers of WBCs","severity of adenoviral infection","host immunological response","significant number of fatalities","absolute segment cell counts","suppression of host cellular immunity","lobar consolidation","National Cheng Kung University Hospital","reticular interstitial opacities","platelets","non-immunocompromised individuals","ASCs","retrospective case series study","CD8","METHODS","CD20","HAdV","T cells","main inclusion criteria","BACKGROUND","mechanisms","large-scale studies","protracted disease course","CONCLUSION","viruses"],"language":"en"},

The nasopharynx is also the niche for potentially pathogenic agents which are associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), a serious and costly illness in feedlot cattle. We used 14 beef heifers from a closed and disease-free herd to assess the dynamics of the NP microbiota of cattle that are transported to a feedlot. Cattle were sampled prior to transport to the feedlot (day 0) and at days 2, 7, and 14. RESULTS: The structure of the NP microbiota changed significantly over the course of the study, with the largest shift occurring between day 0 (prior to transport) and day 2 (P \u003C 0.001). Phylogenetic diversity and richness increased following feedlot placement (day 2; P \u003C 0.05). The genera Pasteurella, Bacillus, and Proteus were enriched at day 0, Streptococcus and Acinetobacter at day 2, Bifidobacterium at day 7, and Mycoplasma at day 14. The functional potential of the NP microbiota was assessed using PICRUSt, revealing that replication and repair, as well as translation pathways, were more relatively abundant in day 14 samples. These differences were driven mostly by Mycoplasma. Although eight cattle were culture-positive for the BRD-associated bacterium Pasteurella multocida at one or more sampling times, none were culture-positive for Mannheimia haemolytica or Histophilus somni. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the effect that feedlot placement has on the NP microbiota of beef cattle over a 14-d period. Within two days of transport to the feedlot, the NP microbiota changed significantly, increasing in both phylogenetic diversity and richness. These results demonstrate that there is an abrupt shift in the NP microbiota of cattle after transportation to a feedlot. This may have importance for understanding why cattle are most susceptible to BRD after feedlot placement.

Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 3 million confirmed cases by the end of April 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. Methods We used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 5,349 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure. Results We used 3,958 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.

The new virus is rapidly spreading in humans and cases of severe acute respiratory syndromes are being reported worldwide. Health authority advisors and governments from small towns to large countries need to quickly manage and deal with growing epidemiological data on a daily basis. In this work, current available data from reported cases and deaths over time were analyzed and treated. Lethality has been calculated by finding linearization of death cases against reported ones, using a time-delayed data transposition. A two-wave statistical model, 2WM, based on the superposition of normal distributions was used to fit current data and to estimate the evolution of infections and deaths, using Microsoft Excel(R). The model showed good agreement even for apparent single wave behavior in some countries and can easily be extended to any number of waves. A gamma distribution was used as a risk function to estimate death probability from patient admission to reported death. Evolution of fatality cases over time can then be estimated from the model with reasonable accuracy. Data from South Korea, China, Australia, Germany, Italy and Spain were used to validate the model. Data from The United States, United Kingdom and Brazil were used to study the epidemiology as the pandemic progresses. Additionally, the 2WM was applied to world data and to the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The model was implemented in MS-Excel, a popular and easy to use analytical tool. A template spreadsheet is provided as supplementary material. Constant lethality can be determined from the initial stage of the pandemic wave. Values ranged from 1.7% to 15.3%, depending on the degree of possible sub notification cases. Even for places with low testing, a linear relationship can be found. The two-wave model can be fine-tuned to properly adjust the data. The second wave pattern was estimated according to the first wave parameter. The accuracy for estimating COVID-19 evolution was compared to the classic SIR model with good agreement. According to the model, based on current trends, health protocols and policies, approximately 10,000,000 cases and 860,000 deaths will be recorded worldwide. Approximately 99% of that number would be reached by the end of July 2020 given constant conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Noni, A.; da Silva, B.

METHODS An online 42-question multiple choice survey was randomly distributed between April 1, 2020, and April 12, 2020 to various active Emergency Medical Services (EMS) paid personnel in all 50 U.S. states including the District of Columbia (n=165). We approximate a 95% confidence interval (\u002B/- 0.0755). RESULTS An overwhelming number of EMS providers report having limited access to N95 respirators, receiving little or no benefits from COVID-19 related work, and report no institutional policy on social distancing practices despite CDC recommendations. For providers who do have access to N95 respirators, 31% report having to use the same mask for 1 week or longer. Approximately [1/3] of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious. The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice. DISCUSSION Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol. Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted. The data reveals concerning deficits in COVID-19 related education and administrative protocols which pose as a serious public health concern that should be urgently addressed.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ventura, C.; Gibson, C.

We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and European PMC for pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv. We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. Results: We screened 571 articles and included five low risk-of-bias studies from three countries (China (2), USA (2), Italy (1)) that tested 9,242 at-risk people, of which 413 were positive and 65 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-qPCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 6% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 16% (95% CI: 12% - 20%) overall; higher in non-aged care 19% (15% - 24%), and lower in long-term aged care 8% (4% - 14%). Two studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases but suggested lower rates than symptomatic cases. Conclusion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still substantial.

Early activation of robust measures has been shown to control the daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. As countries begin to control COVID-19 spread an understanding of how to ease social distancing measures to prevent a rebound in cases and deaths is required. Methods: Using COVID-19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual-based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia. Simulation of virus transmission in this model, with and without, social distancing measures activated permitted us to quantify social distancing effectiveness. Optimal strategies for relaxing social distancing were determined under two settings: with high numbers of daily cases, as in New York; and where early social distancing activation resulted in limited ongoing transmission, as in Perth, Australia. Findings: In countries where strong social distancing measures were activated after the COVID-19 virus had spread widely, our study found these measures are required to be maintained for significant periods before being eased, to return to a situation where daily case numbers become low. In countries where early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been highly successful, as in Australia, we show that a staged relaxation of social distancing prevents a rebound in cases. Interpretation: Modelling studies and direct observation have shown that robust and timely social distancing have the most effect in containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society and economic activity.

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age (\u2265 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID-19 (all for P \u003C 0.001). Meanwhile, old age (\u2265 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45) and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49-5.61) were found to be independent prognostic factors for the COVID-19 related death. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to explore the risk factors of prognosis in patients with COVID-19, which is helpful to identify early-stage patients with poor prognosis and adapt effective treatment.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xianxian; Zhang, Bili; Li, Pan; Ma, Chaoqun; Gu, Jiawei; Hou, Pan; Guo, Zhifu; Wu, Hong; Bai, Yuan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96227f572ef897844b59b1c8bb6c853b6162c547.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037572","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Observational Studies","COVID"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Coronavirus Disease","cardiovascular disease","cerebrovascular disease","predictors of disease severity","confirmed COVID","clinical features of COVID","severe COVID","RR","chronic kidney disease","risk factors of prognosis","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","yrs","stage patients","clinical characteristics","old age","clinical outcomes","pooled incidence of severity","Meta-analysis of Observational Studies","random-effects meta-analysis","subgroup analysis","summary","meta-regression","independent prognostic factors","mean age","pooled data","mortality","male","poor prognosis","related death","terms of laboratory results","Embase","LDH","D-dimer","increased lactate dehydrogenase","Web of Science Core Collection","Cochrane","decreased blood platelet","lymphocytes count","Epidemiology","C-reactive protein","PubMed","CRP","evidence-based medicine research","MOOSE","I2 method","COPD","MedRxiv databases","effective treatment","recommendations","outbreak","CKD","total","years","odds ratio","knowledge","Wuhan","China","Heterogeneity","Methods","study","Background","hypertension","Conclusions","Objectives","diabetes","smoking","comorbidity"],"language":"en"},

Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded description of dynamics of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which challenges containment strategies, in particular, due to delayed epidemic responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, spatial heterogeneity questions the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here we show that sequential data assimilation of a stochastic version of the standard SEIR epidemic model captures dynamical behavior of outbreaks on the regional level. Such regional modeling of epidemics with relatively low numbers of infected and realistic demographic noise accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted regional models, population level short-term predictions can be achieved. More realistic epidemic models that include spatial heterogeneity are within reach via sequential data assimilation methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Engbert, Ralf; Rabe, Maximilian M.; Kliegl, Reinhold; Reich, Sebastian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a1f496070d38657550b30ae8b3c9efff4884d55.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063768","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["realistic epidemic models","Standard epidemic models","epidemic responses","regional level","standard SEIR epidemic model","adapted regional models","adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks","spatial heterogeneity questions","SEIR model","regional modeling of epidemics","better predictive models","COVID","sequential data assimilation methods","population level short-term predictions","tuned responses","dynamical behavior of outbreaks","realistic demographic noise accounts","stochastic version","low numbers of infected","reach","well-founded description of dynamics","hidden build-up of exposed individuals","symptom onset","containment strategies","disease incidence","deep impact","infectiousness peaking","non-pharmaceutical interventions","society","stochasticity","emerging pandemics","country"],"language":"en"},

Foot-and-mouth disease devastated British herds in 2001, bovine tuberculosis, which had been hoped for eradication after 50 years of fighting, has re-emerged in the United Kingdom and France... At the same time, new infectious diseases, often zoonotic, have appeared in animals and in humans : HP avian influenza H5N1 in 2003, SARS in 2003, the MERS-CoVin2012\u2026 The reasons for these emergences are multiple because each disease has its own determinants. However, three main groups of factors can be cited: the evolution of pathogens (RNA viruses in particular), environmental changes favoring the development of vectors and reservoirs, and human behavior. The constant movement of humans, animals and their products on the planet, densification of populations and massive displacements linked to conflicts are probably at the heart of these evolutions. For the future, the challenges are to understand the infectious risks linked to these evolutions in order to try to prevent them. Epidemiology through surveillance and investigation will be tomorrow more than ever, at the heart of the prevention of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dufour, Barbara","journal":"Bulletin de l\u0027Acad\u00E9mie Nationale de M\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e3bb9e0f2e5b6f59a76b080586af5d8de106b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919304108; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919304108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new infectious diseases","prevention of infectious diseases","infectious risks","animals","heart","evolutions","mouth disease","constant movement of humans","RNA viruses","environmental changes","HP avian influenza H5N1","development of vectors","densification of populations","British herds","planet","massive displacements","reasons","reservoirs","evolution of pathogens","SARS","emergences","conflicts","products","veterinarians","time","France","MERS-CoVin2012","human behavior","bovine tuberculosis","challenges","SUMMARY","doctors","years of fighting","United Kingdom","main groups of factors","developed countries","Epidemiology","surveillance","investigation","eradication","order","Foot","dramatic way","future","determinants"],"language":"en"},

Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in the diagnosis of this novel pneumonia. This study aims to understand the role of CT for the diagnosis and the main imaging manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 104 studies with 5694 patients were included. Using RT-PCR results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.11-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that chest CT scan had a high sensitivity in diagnosis of patients with COVID-19.

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical droplet precaution to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, given that asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks within the public, can be highly contagious for COVID-19, prevention of environmental droplet contamination (EnDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote public droplet safety, we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 social distancing. All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to \u003C30cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to \u003C10cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a community droplet reduction solution (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks \u0026 surface covers) could reduce EnDC and the risk of transmitting or acquiring infectious respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Palacios, Alexander; Cominelli, Fabio; Basson, Abigail; Pizarro, Theresa; Ilic, Sanja","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab8c387a925cb8ddb2a04ce84b202e5851fef06a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20045617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["droplet dispersion","public droplet safety","prevention of environmental droplet contamination","oral-respiratory droplet contamination","minimum medical droplet precaution","effective environmental droplet barriers","universal community droplet reduction solution","use of medical masks","dispersion of droplets","shortage of masks","bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection","main form of COVID","EnDC","immediate solution","household textiles","synchronized implementation of EDBs","transmission","hospitals","surfaces","sneeze","area of circumferential contamination","surface covers","minimum distance","number of droplets","asymptomatic individuals","double-layers","single layers","infectious respiratory pathogens","facemasks","coughing","surgical-cloth materials","potential","health-care workers","scarfs","available clothing fabrics","small drop of liquid","risk of transmitting","extent","speech","sneezing","pandemic","availability","priority","social distancing","result","distribution"],"language":"en"},

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. Conclusion Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Na; Han, Lefei; Peng, Min; Lv, Yuxia; Ouyang, Yin; Liu, Kui; Yue, Linli; Li, Qiannan; Sun, Guoqiang; Chen, Lin; Yang, Lin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ee1c4206000ff063b7b10405ead09cbd73b0cf6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033605","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected COVID","confirmed COVID","neonatal outcomes of pregnant women","maternal complications","postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients","Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women","severe neonatal complications","admission","typical chest CT images of COVID","vaginal delivery","Conclusion Severe maternal","neutrophils","CRP","preterm delivery","respiratory failure","suspected cases","cesarean section","caesarean section","control group","Increased levels of WBC","case-control study","lower counts of white blood cells","clinical characteristics","potential adverse effects","fever","C-reactive protein","serious concerns","alanine aminotransferase","need of effective screening","eosinophils","rest","cough","newborns","limited data","ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease","pregnancy","labor","ALT","mothers","controls","Methods","hospital","infection","trimester","Results"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in \u223C170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2\u002B liver progenitor population. Importantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver (immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2\u002B progenitors in liver may significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.

The positive implications of mitigation generally accrue as these measures are adopted early, with the most striking effects seen when the reproductive number is lowered to a level Rc\u22481.0.

Aiming for reproduction numbers close to 1.0 can substantially reduce fatality probabilities over short time scales, particularly for larger populations. We conclude that research is urgently needed on how mitigation measures impact R0 and how these can be optimized so as to achieve Rc\u22481.0 whilst supporting individual freedoms, society and the economy.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hochberg, Michael E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0b2b40a782d37fc576c61da5805932991d83b8c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delaying measures","adopting measures","mitigation measures impact R0","reproduction number number R0","effects of lowering R0","reproductive number","positive implications of mitigation","striking effects","early stages","level Rc","reproduction numbers close","changes","short time scales","short-term consequences","total infections","speed","fatality probabilities","magnitude of local outbreaks","clinical outcomes","individual freedoms","peak","half-way","fatalities","larger populations","society","economy","mathematical model","pandemic","COVID","research"],"language":"en"},

In our systematic analysis and meta-review, we have attempted to homogenize the reported features and provide a comprehensive view of the disease pattern and progression in different clinical stages. After an extensive literature search, we short-listed and reviewed 49 studies including over 4145 patients with 3615 RT-PCR positive cases of COVID-19 disease. We have found that there is a good agreement among these studies that diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding at all stages of the disease followed by consolidations and mixed density lesions. 78% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections had either ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both. Inter-lobular septal thickening was also found to be a common feature in many patients in advanced stages. The progression of these initial patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidations to diffuse lesions with septal thickening, air bronchograms in the advanced stages, to either diffuse white-out lungs needing ICU admissions or finally resolving completely without or with residual fibrotic strips was also found to be congruent among multiple studies. Prominent juxta-lesional pulmonary vessels, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy in RT-PCR proven cases were found to have poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, we noted wide variation in terminology used to describe lesions across studies and suggest the use of standardized lexicons to describe findings related to diseases of vital importance.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venugopal, V.

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we have identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiency in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS- and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that these residues were under strong positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. It further proves that R. sinicus is the natural host of SARSr-CoVs. Importance Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS- and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinity to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity of spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests a long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Hua; Hu, Bing-Jie; Yang, Xing-Lou; Zeng, Lei-Ping; Li, Bei; Ouyang, Song-Ying; Shi, Zheng-Li","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6204544a040492ce55fb5c6f8fd58c81abcc7945.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093658","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARSr-CoV infection","SARS-CoV spike protein","human ACE2","diverse SARSr-CoV","bat SARSr-CoVs","tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins","bat ACE2 variants","polymorphic ACE2","SARS-CoV counterpart","different spike proteins","sinicus ACE2 variants","higher binding affinity of SARSr","ACE2 variants support SARS","spike gene","bat SARS-related CoVs","orthologs of human SARS-CoV receptor","different binding affinity","natural host of SARSr","binding affinity assays","lower binding affinity","Chinese horseshoe bat populations","diversity of viruses","Chinese horseshoe bats","positive selection of residues","humans","Rhinolophus sinicus","different infection efficiency","Identification of key residues","receptor molecules","group of viruses","interface","Importance Evolutionary arms race dynamics","interaction","strong positive selection","high genetic diversity","ongoing coevolutionary dynamics","experienced selection pressure","polymorphic sites","capacity of spillover","Consistent results","potential pathogen spillover","reservoir host of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cells","angiotensin","interspecies transmission","time","difference","wildlife","enzyme","Continued surveillance","Molecular evolution analysis","prevention","alteration","series of","Pseudoviruses","variations","Structure modeling","receptors","disease","entry"],"language":"en"},

So far, there has been not much progress in terms of drug development for fighting against this deadliest virus, also no existing drugs has been reported completely effective for COVID-19 treatment owing to lack of effective therapeutic targets and a broad understanding of the viral behavior in target cell. Some reports have found and confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 like others SARS-CoVs utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor for making entry into target cell by binding to the receptor with its S1 subunit and employing host cell proteases for cleaving S2 subunit at S2\u2032 in order to fuse with cell membrane.

Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce changes in Watson-Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2 permissive host cells, we identified twelve separate target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; eight of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease, is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the human host could be constrained by host miRNA defence. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and a potential platform for engineered viral attenuation and antigen presentation.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rad SM, Ali Hosseini; McLellan, Alexander D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6d0a2c9b24b8a196594115f3e3f70afaf2e6717.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["future SARS-CoV","conserved mutations","host miRNAs","miRNA targets","human host","host miRNA defence","resultant changes","secondary structures","potential platform","predicted secondary structure","viral fitness","permissive host cells","replication","RNA secondary structure critical","potential splice sites","viral life cycle","engineered viral attenuation","amino acid changes","matching miRNAs","mutation rate","separate target sequences","Watson-Crick pairing","new context","evolution","antigen presentation","transmission","addition","model","abundant miR","patients","cardiovascular disease","isolates","virus","subsets of genomes","genomic site","zoonotic pathogen","results","humans","Filtering","globe","impact"],"language":"en"},

It is critically important, therefore, for health systems to protect the lives of their staff especially those on the frontline. Urgent work is needed to identify how best to protect those most at risk in an evidence-based way in order to implement protective allocations. We wished to explore the predictive role of basic demographics in order to establish a simple tool that could help risk stratify healthcare workers. Objectives and Study question: To develop a risk stratification tool for use to assist staff allocation by examining reported demographics of hospitalisation and mortality in the UK from CoViD-19 compared to population demographics and historic admissions for viral pneumoniae. Setting: Secondary Care in the UK and worldwide. Participants: Patients and Health Care Professionals hospitalised and dying of CoViD-19. Methods: We undertook a review of the published literature (including multiple search strategies in MEDLINE with PubMed interface) and critically assessed early reports on medRxiv, a pre-print server (https://www.medrxiv.org/) (date of last search: April 30, 2020). We explored the relative risk of mortality from readily available demographics in order to identify the population at highest risk. Results: The only published studies specifically assessing the risk of healthcare workers had limited demographics available, therefore we explored the general population in the literature. Clinician Demographics. Mortality increased with increasing age from 50 years onwards. Male sex at birth, people of black and minority ethnicity groups had higher susceptibility to both hospitalisation and mortality. Co-morbid Disease. Vascular disease, diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease further increased risk. Those with pre-existing mental health issues may also be more likely to experience emotional trauma, depression and anxiety with consequences for self-harm too. Risk stratification tool. A risk stratification tool was compiled using a Caucasian female \u003C50years with no comorbidities as a reference. A point allocated to risk factors associated with an approximate doubling in risk. This tool provides numerical support for healthcare workers when determining which team members should be allocated to patient facing clinical duties compared to remote supportive roles. Clinical Domain. Those working with aerosol generating procedures were at increased risk, however healthcare workers in any clinical domain are at higher risk than the general population. Conclusions. We have generated a tool which can provide a framework for objective risk stratification of doctors and health care professionals during the CoViD-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jankowski, j.; davies, A.; English, P.; Friedman, E.; mcKeown, H.; Rao, M.; Sethi, S.; Strain, W.

Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patient\u2019s immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn-around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15-20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers using SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and viral antigen \u2013 S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 \u03BCL of samples for each channel.

However, assuming that population immunity will build up through the epidemic, it is likely to rebound once these measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a second or multiple repeated lockdowns. In this report, we present results of epidemiological modelling that has helped inform policy making in France. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France, and examined the potential impact of post-quarantine measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and shielding of the population the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on the disease\u0027s cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is effective in containing the viral spread, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, regardless of its duration. Both social distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing the overwhelming of ICUs and a second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower cumulative incidence, mortality, and maintaining an adequate number of ICU beds to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if these measures were not applied by most people or not maintained for a sufficiently long period, as herd immunity progressively establishes in the less vulnerable population.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoertel, N.; Blachier, M.; Blanco, C.; Olfson, M.; Massetti, M.; Sanchez Rico, M.; Limosin, F.; Leleu, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d6a0719cdddbb890c27224d8fe21539b2d0a518.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20086264v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["epidemic","mortality","vulnerable population","population immunity","shielding of vulnerable people","potential impact of post-quarantine measures","severe COVID","nationwide implementation of barrier measures","social distancing","mask","France","rebound","lower cumulative incidence","disease\u0027s cumulative incidence","little impact","variation of model parameter values","herd immunity","stochastic agent-based microsimulation model","ICU-bed occupancy","adequate number of ICU beds","infection","better outcomes","threat","outcome estimates","present results of epidemiological modelling","viral spread","report","long period","policy","overwhelming of ICUs","multiple repeated lockdowns","European countries","duration","Benefits"],"language":"en"},

There is an intense discussion and uncertainty which factors and sanctions can reduce infection rates. The overall aim is to prevent an overload of the medical system. Even within one country, there is frequently a strong local variability in both -- political sanctions as well as other local factors -- which may influence infection rates. The main focus of study is analysis and interpretation of recent temporal developments (infection rates). We present a statistical framework designed to identify local factors which reduce infection rates. The approach is robust with respect to the number of undetected infection cases. We apply the framework to spatio-temporal infection data from Germany. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) infection rates are in average significantly decreasing in Germany; (2) there is a high spatial variability of these rates, and (3) both, early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities has led to strong recent decays in infection rates, suggesting that psychological effects (such as awareness of danger) lead to behaviour changes that reduce infection rates. However, the full potential of the presented method cannot yet be exploited, since more precise spatio-temporal data, such as local cell phone-based mobility data, are not yet available. In the nearest future, the presented framework could be applied to data from other countries at any state of infection, even during the exponential phase of the growth of infection rates.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mercker, Moritz; Betzin, Uwe; Wilken, Dennis","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2902f45cc1baa7a32d5462fc274a3a50e328352.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["growth of infection rates","state of infection","spatio-temporal infection data","high local infection densities","local factors","number of undetected infection cases","strong local variability","precise spatio-temporal data","presented framework","local cell phone-based mobility data","interpretation of recent temporal developments","strong recent decays","recent COVID","statistical framework","Germany","high spatial variability","political sanctions","presented method","analysis","infections","behaviour changes","awareness of danger","pandemic","respect","lead","psychological effects","exponential phase","overload","main focus of study","uncertainty","intense discussion","early emergence","world-wide concern","nearest future","countries","average","overall aim","medical system","approach","potential","country"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A total of 419 patients were enrolled including 19 confirmed cases and 400 patients from fever clinics. Their serial serum samples collected during the hospitalization were menstruated for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using gold immunochromatographic assay and chemiluminescence immunoassay. We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of antibody detection. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress and false positive factors for antibody testing were also analyzed. Results: The positive rate of IgG detection was 91.67% and 83.33% using two CLIA, respectively. However, the IgM positive rate was dramatically declined might due to the lack of blood samples at early stages of the disease. The chemiluminescence immunoassay had a favorable but narrow linear range. Our work showed increased IgG values in serums from virus-negative patients and four negative samples were IgG weak-positive after thermal incubation. Our data showed the specificity of viral N\u002BS proteins was higher than single antigen. Unlike generally thought that IgM appeared earlier than IgG, there is no certain chronological order of IgM and IgG seroconversion in COVID-19 patients. It was difficult to detect antibodies in asymptomatic patients suggesting that their low viral loads were not enough to cause immune response. Analysis of common interferent in three IgG false-positive patients, such as rheumatoid factor, proved that false positives were not caused by these interfering substances and antigenic cross-reaction. Conclusions: Viral serological test is an effective means for SARS-CoV-2 infect detection using both chemiluminescence immunoassay and gold immunochromatographic assay.

They are often receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics; they have multiple entry points for pathogens; and their immune system is impaired by blood circuit interaction. These factors are thought to predispose them to fungal infections. We thus aimed to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis of fungal infections in adults on ECMO. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, which compiles data on ECMO use from hundreds of international centers. We included all adult patients from 2006 to 2016 on any mode of ECMO with either a diagnosis of fungal infection or a positive fungal culture. RESULTS: Our study comprised 2129 adult patients (10.8%) with fungal colonization or infection. Aspergillus involvement (colonization or infection) was present in 272 patients (1.4%), of whom 35.7% survived to hospital discharge. There were 245 patients (1.2%) with Candida invasive bloodstream infection, with 35.9% survival. Risk factors for Aspergillus involvement included solid organ transplant (OR 1.83; p = 0.008), respiratory support (OR 2.75; p \u003C 0.001), and influenza infection (OR 2.48; p \u003C 0.001). Risk factors for candidemia included sepsis (OR 1.60; p = 0.005) and renal replacement therapy (OR 1.55; p = 0.007). In multivariable analysis, Aspergillus involvement (OR 0.40; p \u003C 0.001) and candidemia (OR 0.47; p \u003C 0.001) were both independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Aspergillus involvement and Candida invasive bloodstream infection were not higher in patients on ECMO than what has been reported in the general intensive care population. Both were independently associated with a reduced survival. Aspergillus involvement was strongly associated with ECMO for respiratory support and influenza.

Immunocompromised hosts (ICH) with respiratory illnesses often undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the yield and concordance of NP and BAL FARP testing when performed on the same patient concurrently. METHODS: From February to December 2016, 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) were enrolled. NP swabs and BAL samples were sent for FARP testing. RESULTS: The yield of the BAL FARP among ICH and non-ICH was 24% (24/100) and 8% (2/25), respectively. The yield of positive NP swabs in ICH was 27% (27/100) versus 4% (1/25) in non-ICH. The majority of patients (89%; 111/125) had concordant results between NP and BAL specimens. Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. CONCLUSION: The FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.","publish_time":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azadeh, Natalya; Sakata, Kenneth K.; Saeed, Ali; Mullon, John J.; Grys, Thomas E.; Limper, Andrew H.; Binnicker, Matthew J.","journal":"Can Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1697f41650571796c51a52e8f5412d293f620c79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5907482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5907482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.","NP","BAL FARP","BAL","FARP","NP FARP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NP FARP","ICH patients","positive BAL FARP","BAL FARP testing","non-ICH","BAL samples","BAL specimens","concordance of NP","yield of positive NP swabs","incremental yield","majority of patients","respiratory illnesses","respiratory viruses","pathogen","FilmArray Respiratory Panel","single reaction","concordant results","high concordance","polymerase chain reaction","technique","multiplex","PCR","bacterial targets","bronchoscopy","bronchoalveolar lavage","BioFire Diagnostics","Immunocompromised hosts","BACKGROUND","prospective study","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The mucin MUC5B is an important component of the innate immune response and expression levels are associated with the MUC5B promoter polymorphism, rs35705950. The high expressing T-allele of rs35705950 is an accepted risk allele for a non-infectious aging lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, given the theory of trade-offs in aging lung disease and the importance of high expression for an adequate immune response, we hypothesize that the T-allele is protective against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We collected demographics, radiology, survival data and MUC5B rs35705950 allele status for 108 patients requiring hospitalisation for COVID-19 at St Antonius Hospital in The Netherlands. For comparison of allele frequencies and allele carriership with a white control cohort, the patient cohort was divided in a white (n=83) and non-white cohort. Results The patients had a median age of 66 years and consisted predominantly of males (74%) and 23 patients (21%) died. The T-allele frequencies of rs35705950 in white patients was 0.04 which was significantly lower than the T-allele frequency of 0.10 in white controls (p= 0.02). Moreover, comparison of the number of carriers and non-carriers of the T allele showed that only 8.4% of patients carried the T-allele versus 18% of controls (p=0.029; OR= 0.41, CI=0.19-0.94). Conclusions The MUC5B rs35705950 promoter polymorphism associates with COVID-19. The risk allele (T) for IPF is protective against the development of severe COVID-19 disease. This is a further example of a trade-off between optimal expression levels in the respiratory system which associates with aging diseases. However, these results require further investigation.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Moorsel, C. H. M.; van der Vis, J. J.; Benschop, C.; Ruven, H. J.

Object: Support for policymaking requires forecasting of the entire course and outcome of the outbreak including the date of collapse of medical facilities if a lockdown is not initiated. Moreover, the effects of a lockdown must be considered when choosing to initiate one. Method: Data of Tokyo patients with symptoms during January 14 \u2212 March 28, 2020 were used to formulate a susceptible\u2212infected\u2212recovered (SIR) model using three age classes and to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0). Based on the estimated R0, We inferred outbreak outcomes including the date of collapse of medical facilities if a lockdown were not enacted. Then we estimate the lockdown effects. Results: Results suggest R0 as 2.86, with a 95% confidence interval of [2.73, 2.97]. Collapse of medical facilities can be expected to occur on April 26 if no lockdown occurs. The total number of deaths can be expected to be half a million people. If a lockdown were enacted from April 6, and if more than 60% of trips outside the home were restricted voluntarily, then a collapse of medical facilities could be avoided. Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R0 was similar to that found from other studies conducted in China and Japan. Results demonstrate that a lockdown with reasonable cooperation of residents can avoid a collapse of medical facilities and save 0.25 million mortality cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurita, Junko; Sugawara, Tamie; Ohkusa, Yasushi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d156565e44bc5d6868c889b8199f52bacfc70514.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo","China","Japan"],"keyphrases":["Collapse of medical facilities","lockdown effects","date of collapse","estimated R0","Results","number of patients","Data of Tokyo patients","basic reproduction number","total number of deaths","outbreak outcomes","forecasting","SIR","policymaking","entire course","age classes","reasonable cooperation of residents","model","Conclusion","studies","Object","Support","Method","symptoms","Discussion","COVID","mortality cases","China","Japan","Background","confidence interval","trips","home","end","people"],"language":"en"},

Human-to-human transmissions, as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 3rd, public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data).

The prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic (different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.

Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates.

Here we estimate the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 and propose a dynamical model for the time course of infection number. With this model, we assessed the effects of different measures for infection risk control. The model is different from the previous ones as it models the population as heterogeneous, with subpopulations having different infection risks. Our analyses showed that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately: the total number of cases and peak number of cases are lower compared to the homogeneous case, the early-stage growth rate in the number of infection cases is little affected, and the decrease in the number of infections slows down during the epidemic late stage. The comparison of our model results with the available data for COVID-19 indicates that the anti-epidemic measures undertaken in China and the rest of the world managed to decrease the basic reproductive number but did not assure an accumulation of sufficient collective immunity. Thus, the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart, which necessitates a careful approach to lifting the quarantine measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerasimov, A.; Lebedev, G.; Lebedev, M.; Semenycheva, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc49552ce19a7c47d89afe7b98cc330c54da9d49.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20090688v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of infection cases","number of infections","selection of anti-epidemic measures","peak number of cases","total number of cases","epidemic late stage","basic reproductive number","time course of infection number","COVID","different infection risks","effects of different measures","model results","dynamical model","quarantine measures","previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome","infection risk control","decrease","lifting","previous ones","early-stage growth rate","SARS","subpopulations","China","homogeneous case","world","rigorous analysis","available data","accumulation of sufficient collective immunity","ongoing Coronavirus disease","careful approach","rest","heterogeneity","comparison","high likelihood","characteristics","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods: All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We collected conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships.

Methods: A score based on demographics and symptoms was developed in a cross-sectional study including patients attended in a dedicated COVID-19 screening unit. A backward stepwise logistic regression model was constructed and values for each variable were assigned according to their {beta} coefficient values in the final model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: A total of 464 patients were included: 98 (21.1%) COVID-19 and 366 (78.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. The score included variables independently associated with COVID-19 in the final model: age equal or above 60 years (2 points), fever (2), dyspnea (1), fatigue (1 point) and coryza (-1).

Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of \u2248 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. In addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. Our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Pai; Beeler, Payton; Chakrabarty, Rajan K","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a3e029af35ac20b59991b5f5adf1d15ff4ee8f9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Washington","New York"],"keyphrases":["epidemic progression","epidemic outbreak","epidemic dynamic model","state-wise epidemic peaks","national epidemic peak","community-level interventions","timely interventions","confirmed COVID","cases","arrival of state","states of Washington","United States","model predictions","rapid upsurge of COVID","daily counts of active","daily active count","arrival timeline","containment plans","US population","effectiveness of containment strategies","preparedness","large fraction","estalished network","liquid-asset","pressing need","transmissibility","Wholesale interstate traffic restriction","burden","limited available medical resources","optimal timing necessary","poverty populations","findings","New York","reduction","timeframe","addition","disease","days"],"language":"en"},

Background SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercoagulability and inflammation leading to venous thrombotic events (VTE). Although elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk, COVID-19 may also cause VTE in a broader patient population without these risks. Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress. Case description : Case report of a 29-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history or comorbidities, presenting with new onset seizures. Further questioning revealed a one-week history of headaches, low-grade fever, mild cough and shortness of breath, diagnosed as COVID-19. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis treated with full dose anticoagulation and antiepileptics. Conclusion Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein, David E.; Libman, Richard; Kirsch, Claudia; Arora, Rohan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6097bf37ebedd8b582e03dec6778343952335d3b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720304079; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720304079?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["manifestations of COVID","presenting feature of COVID","comorbidities","Neurologic complications","VTE","severe established cases of COVID","Case report","infection","highest risk","higher risk","systemic symptoms","Case description","elderly patients","venous thrombotic events","left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction","left transverse","radiographic features of venous infarct","mild cough","young individuals","week history of headaches","new onset seizures","significant past medical history","low-grade fever","sigmoid sinus thrombosis","encephalopathy","year-old woman","hypercoagulability","inflammation","shortness of breath","dose anticoagulation","Abstract Objective","broader patient population","strokes","Imaging","neuropathies","Background SARS-CoV","risks","respiratory distress","associated hypercoagulable state","Conclusion","antiepileptics","questioning"],"language":"en"},

However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition. Objective: The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases, which can also be adapted to analyze COVID19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Methods: Using previously published information on elective ambulatory or outpatient surgical procedures and publicly available data on COVID19 infections in the US and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state. Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 2445 preventable patient infections and at least 1557 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual. The majority of these infections are caused by transmission from HCW who became infected at work. Conclusion: Given the large numbers of COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling elective outpatient surgeries, our findings support the recommendations of the US Surgeon General, CDC, American College of Surgeons (ACS), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) to consider rescheduling or postponing elective surgeries until the COVID19 pandemic is under better control in the US.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yuemei; Cheng, Sheng-Ru","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef395bb81012eacc7628d0425be9a3a46a8ada9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037952","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","HCW","American College of Surgeons","Anesthesia Patient","Safety Foundation"],"locations":["Washington","WA"],"keyphrases":["elective surgeries","preventable COVID19 infections","elective outpatient surgeries","elective outpatient procedures","elective ambulatory","COVID19 transmission","COVID19 pandemic","preventable patient infections","large numbers of COVID19 infections","confirmed COVID19 cases","outpatient surgical procedures","US surgeon general","appropriate handling of elective surgical cases","recommendations","number of healthcare","preventable healthcare worker","ambulatory surgery cases","mathematical model","HCW","healthcare settings","transmission rate","controversy","results","Disease Control","number of suspected","WA state","health policy","public health","better control","Washington state","American College of Surgeons","American Society of Anesthesiologists","Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation","available data","ASA","ACS","Centers","CDC","positive impact","published information","quantitative analysis","Prevention","findings","Diamond Princess cruise ship","study","APSF","days","specialty societies","Objective","goal","Conclusion","Methods","Background","course","opposition","majority"],"language":"en"},

Abstract A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31st of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world. This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palacios Cruz, M.; Santos, E.; Vel\u00E1zquez Cervantes, M.

This pattern of race-ethnic disparities emerging throughout the United States raises the question of what social factors may influence spread of a highly transmissible novel coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to describe race-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19 in patients in our community in Orange County, California and understand the role of individual-level factors, neighborhood-level factors, and access to care on outcomes. Methods: This is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3/12/2020 and 4/22/2020. Note, California\u0027s shelter-in-place order began on 3/19/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded. Results: A total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p \u003C 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after California\u0027s shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p \u003C 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p \u003C 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study examines the race-ethnic disparities in Orange County, CA, and highlights vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Our descriptive case series illustrates that we also need to consider socioeconomic factors, which ultimately set the stage for biological and social disparities.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, D.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riccardo, Flavia; Ajelli, Marco; Andrianou, Xanthi; Bella, Antonino; Del Manso, Martina; Fabiani, Massimo; Bellino, Stefania; Boros, Stefano; Mateo Urdiales, Alberto; Marziano, Valentina; Rota, Maria Cristina; Filia, Antonietta; D\u0027Ancona, Fortunato (Paolo); Siddu, Andrea; Punzo, Ornella; Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Poletti, Piero; Stefanelli, Paola; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Ciervo, Alessandra; Di Benedetto, Corrado; Tallon, Marco; Piccioli, Andrea; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Merler, Stefano; Pezzotti, Patrizio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8d97f4fa91c3d970847aec94924658cf39f8450.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20056861","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","reported COVID","Italy","Lombardia","Italian regions","national case","northern regions","Overall Rt","country","days","Estimates of R0","high case-load","national level epidemic","RT-PCR","decreasing trend","Initial R0","net reproductive numbers","net reproduction number","epidemic doubling time","overall crude CFR","independent risk factors","age","worse outcomes","integrated surveillance system","importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures","rapid geographical spread","Male sex","older males","comorbidities","signal of ongoing transmission of SARS","clustering onset similar","associated deaths","Wuhan","China","years","declaration","Lazio","health care workers","data","autonomous provinces","Veneto","Emilia-Romagna","descriptive epidemiological summary","large diversities","people","Methods","outbreak","Interpretation","infections","Findings","pandemic","Toscana","Background"],"language":"en"},

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. Methods Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. Results The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period. Conclusions We are still at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and scientific evidence is still scarce and incomplete, so these ABORL-CCF recommendations for otorhinolaryngologists may be updated based on new knowledge and the pattern of the new coronavirus spread.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavinsky, Joel; Kosugi, Eduardo Macoto; Baptistella, Eduardo; Roithman, Renato; Dolci, Eduardo; Ribeiro, Thais Knoll; Rossini, Bruno; Romano, Fabrizio Ricci; Maunsell, Rebecca Christina Kathleen; Mitre, Edson Ibrahim; Imamura, Rui; Hachya, Adriana; Chone, Carlos Takahiro; Watanabe, Luciana Miwa Nita; Fornazieri, Marco Aur\u00E9lio; Lessa, Marcus Miranda; Sant\u2019Anna, Geraldo Druck","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17aaf13eb9bff6f34689caf4fbbb8b41a9a47f84.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1808869420300379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869420300379","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","new coronavirus","rapid spread","new knowledge","ABORL-CCF recommendations","general aspects of COVID","use of personal protective equipment","otorhinolaryngological care","management of sinonasal","main recommendations of national","pandemic period","novel coronavirus","Otorhinolaryngologists","patients","routine ENT care","scientific evidence","patient assistance","main objective","international scientific societies","endoscopic exam routines","use of telemedicine resources","decisions","government agencies","Cervical-Facial Surgery","elective surgeries","Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology","otological","pediatric evaluations","consequences","postponing appointments","exams","class councils","result","pattern","central role","population","health professionals","contamination","great impact","beginning","behaviors","view","areas of otolaryngology","Abstract Introduction","situation","Methods","medical community","topics","Conclusions","guidance"],"language":"en"},

The major disadvantage of this technique is that mechanical disturbances to the electrodes are in the same frequency and magnitude range as the desired signal. In this work we propose an approach and a realized measurement system to combine EMG and bioimpedance measurements for higher reliabilities of muscle contraction detections. Methods: We propose the development of a modular four-channel measurement system, whereat each channel is capable of acquiring EMG, the bioimpedance magnitude and phase, simultaneously. The modules are synchronized by an additional interface board, which communicates with a PC. A graphical user interface enables to control the bioimpedance excitation current in a range from 100 {\\mu}A to 1 mA in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 333 kHz. Results: A system characterization demonstrated that bioimpedance magnitude changes of less than 250 ppm and phase changes below 0.05{\\deg} can be detected reliably. Measurements from a subject have shown the timing relationship between EMG and bioimpedance signals as well as their robustness against mechanical disturbances. A measurement of five exemplary hand gestures has demonstrated the increase of usable information for detecting muscle contractions. Conclusion: Bioimpedance measurements of muscles provide useful information about contractions. Furthermore, the usage of a known high-frequency excitation current enables a reliable differentiation between the actual information and disturbances. Significance: By combining EMG and bioimpedance measurements, muscle contractions can be detected much more reliably. This setup can be adopted to prostheses and many other human-computer interfaces.","publish_time":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kusche, Roman; Ryschka, Martin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee7e84470a75bc95997471913270778b56e19b9a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10137v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EMG measurements","Bioimpedance measurements of muscles","bioimpedance signals","bioimpedance magnitude changes","Muscle contractions","bioimpedance excitation current","frequency range","magnitude range","channel measurement system","mechanical disturbances","capable of acquiring EMG","realized measurement system","system characterization","useful information","actual information","phase changes","kHz","known high-frequency excitation current","increase of usable information","higher reliabilities of muscle contraction detections","additional interface board","graphical user interface","reliable differentiation","timing relationship","exemplary hand gestures","technique","approach","ppm","robustness","desired signal","prostheses","development","usage","subject","electrodes","Conclusion","human-computer interfaces","major disadvantage","modules","Results","deg","Objective","Significance","setup","PC","Methods","work"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. RESULTS: Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without. CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Xiaoqin; Guo, Zhongmin; Duan, Chaohui; chen, Zeliang; Wang, Guoling; Lu, Yi; Li, Mengfeng; Lu, Jiahai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3c2e2839498c613ee95739dce7052109750362c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","Anti SARS-CoV IgG","presence of SARS","IgG antibodies","virus-specific IgG","lower IgG titers","recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS","non-infected healthcare workers","long term persistence of IgG","years","clustered infected cases","virus neutralization","future infection","time of infection","ongoing worldwide outbreak","nCoV","Serum samples","limited information","valuable information","special population of patients","long-term prospective cohort study","prevention","important roles","humoral immune responses","severe acute respiratory syndrome","hospital","protection","METHODS","China","ELISA","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","corticosteroids","Guangzhou","CONCLUSIONS","high level","diagnostic antigen","sera","betacoronavirus","year follow-up","slower rate"],"language":"en"},

While the medical community understands the mode of viral transmission, less is known about how long viral shedding occurs once viral symptoms have resolved. Objective: To determine how long the SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable following self-reporting of viral symptom resolution. Design: A cohort of 86 previously SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were re-tested for proof of viral recovery by nasal swab and nucleic acid amplification less than 28 days after self-reported symptom resolution. Setting: A tertiary care center in a mid-size city utilizing a drive-through SAR-CoV-2 testing center. Participants: 86 previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals less than 28 days after self-reported resolution of symptoms evaluated as potential donors for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Intervention: Participants underwent nasopharyngeal sampling and subsequent nucleic acid amplification for SARS-CoV-2 genes. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretions detected by rtPCR. Results: 11/86 (13%) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 subjects were still positive at a median of 19 days (range 12-24 days) after symptom resolution. Older patients were more likely to be test-positive, and older positive patients had lower rtPCR CT values. Test-positive patients were not significantly different from test-negative patients with respect to days since symptom recovery. Conclusions and Resolution: These results underscore the necessity of testing COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors less than 28 days after symptom resolution and suggests that COVID-19 positive patients may need to remain in quarantine beyond the recommended two weeks following \u0022recovery.\u0022","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hartman, W.

However, it is urgent to need the rapid and accurate detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based and nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Method: We retrospectively and observationally studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time RT-PCR detection for COVID-19 patients. Results: Of 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no significant difference of gender and age among three subgroups. Overall, the positive ratio in IgM antibody test was higher than in RT-PCR detection. In RT-PCR detection, the positive ratio was 65.91%, 71.15%, and 67.57% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas, the positive ratio of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.55%/93.18%, 82.69%/100%, and 72.97%/97.30% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively.

A significant portion of patients are presenting with delirium and neuropsychiatric sequelae of the disease. Unique exam findings and responses to treatment have been identified. We seek to provide pharmacologic and treatment recommendations specific to delirium in patients with COVID-19. Methods We performed a literature search reviewing the neuropsychiatric complications and treatments in prior coronavirus epidemics including middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses as well as the emerging literature regarding COVID-19. We also convened a work group of consultation-liaison psychiatrists actively managing COVID-19 patients in our hospital. Finally, we synthesized these findings to provide preliminary pharmacologic recommendations for treating delirium in these patients. Results Delirium is frequently found in patients who test positive for COVID-19, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. There appears to be a higher rate of agitation, myoclonus, abulia, and alogia. No data are currently available on the treatment of delirium in COVID-19 patients. Extrapolating from general delirium treatment, MERS/SARS case reports, and our experience, preliminary recommendations for pharmacologic management have been assembled. Conclusions COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Low potency neuroleptics and alpha-2 adrenergic agents may be especially useful in this setting. Further research into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 will be key in developing more targeted treatment guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baller, Erica B.; Hogan, Charlotte S.; Fusunyan, Mark A.; Ivkovic, Ana; Luccarelli, James W.; Madva, Elizabeth; Nisavic, Mladen; Praschan, Nathaniel; Quijije, Nadia V.; Beach, Scott R.; Smith, Felicia A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61eb1162055581d9051c76928327e366fdd4861a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033318220301535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318220301535?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of delirium","pathophysiology of COVID","Conclusions COVID","general delirium treatment","Results Delirium","treatment recommendations specific","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","preliminary pharmacologic recommendations","significant portion of patients","preliminary recommendations","neuropsychiatric symptoms","targeted treatment guidelines","absence of respiratory symptoms","middle eastern respiratory syndrome","MERS","pandemic of coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","neuropsychiatric complications","pharmacologic management","neuropsychiatric sequelae","prior coronavirus epidemics","SARS case reports","literature search","emerging literature","Unique exam findings","treatments","experience","coronaviruses","liaison psychiatrists","myoclonus","alpha","adrenergic agents","work group of consultation","abulia","Low potency neuroleptics","Abstract Background","responses","key","higher rate of agitation","biggest health threats","generation","alogia","Methods","data","research","hospital","setting"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk. Methods We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. Results We estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50\u002B years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (\u003E1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%). Conclusion Based on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clark, Andrew; Jit, Mark; Warren-Gash, Charlotte; Guthrie, Bruce; Wang, Harry HX; Mercer, Stewart W; Sanderson, Colin; McKee, Martin; Troeger, Christopher; Ong, Kanyin I; Checchi, Francesco; Perel, Pablo; Joseph, Sarah; Gibbs, Hamish P; Banerjee, Amitava; Eggo, Rosalind M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9432cf9d2e9dd9bde3fa9d3ef07dde254a739069.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20064774v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations","GBD","UK"],"locations":["Africa","Europe"],"keyphrases":["increased risk of severe COVID","increased risk ranges","cardiovascular disease","underlying health conditions","number of individuals","highest risk groups","different underlying conditions","Global Burden of Disease","chronic respiratory disease","prevalence of multimorbidity","Chronic kidney disease","prevalence data","older individuals","list of underlying conditions relevant","prevalent conditions","mapping conditions","high prevalence of diabetes","high prevalence of HIV","GBD","global population","Island countries","high share","African countries","year age groups","health systems","United Nations population","Europe","years","large multimorbidity studies","public health agencies","current guidelines","times higher","appropriate adjustment factors","risks","CVD","study","CKD","CRD","AIDS","targeted shielding policies","sex","effects","robust analyses","UK","clustering","country","females","cases","design of possible strategies","urgent need","thresholds","Conclusion","illness","pandemic","Methods","vs"],"language":"en"},

It is critical we understand the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions to choose a safe exit strategy. Many current models are not suitable for assessing exit strategies because they do not account for epidemic resurgence when social distancing ends prematurely (e.g., statistical curve fits) nor permit scenario exploration in specific locations. We developed an SEIR-type mechanistic epidemiological model of COVID-19 dynamics to explore temporally variable non-pharmaceutical interventions. We provide an interactive tool and code to estimate the transmission parameter, {beta}, and the effective reproduction number, Reff. We fit the model to Santa Clara County, California, where an early epidemic start date and early shelter-in-place orders could provide a model for other regions. As of April 22, 2020, we estimate an Reff of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 - 1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 - 283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Childs, M.

However, there are many unknowns about its epidemiology. Purpose: To synthesize the number of deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases, incubation period, as well as time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, ICU admission, recovery and death of COVID-19. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 through to March 11, 2020 without language restrictions as well as bibliographies of relevant articles. Study Selection: Quantitative studies that recruited people living with or died due to COVID-19. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Conflicts were resolved through discussion with a senior author. Data Synthesis: Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03). Limitations: Studies are observational and findings are mainly based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and so may be biased toward more severe cases. Conclusion: We found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 is longer than other respiratory viral infections including MERS and SARS; however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone might be too conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khalili, Malahat; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Nasiri, Naser; Javadi, Sara; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Sharifi, Hamid","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a2cf4eeb236cbaa2885c9940554afc57cb4c9d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Google Scholar"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CI","onset of COVID","death of COVID","confirmed COVID","diagnosis of COVID","Pooled probability of COVID","onset of symptoms","Pooled mean incubation period","Quantitative studies","Pooled mean number of days","Data Synthesis","Data Extraction","Data Sources","ICU admission","recovery","non-duplicate studies","days of mandatory quarantine","extreme cases","related death","severe cases","medical visit","number of deaths","clinical visit","SARS","MEDLINE","Embase","current policy","corona virus disease","understanding","respiratory viral infections","MERS","findings","independent reviewers","time","Study Selection","discussion","bibliographies of relevant articles","Google Scholar","patient","clinics","Limitations","people","language restrictions","senior author","periods","hospitals","Background","unknowns","epidemiology","Conflicts","Purpose","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The surface S (spike) protein and the highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely considered as promising candidates for vaccines.

In this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients were strongly correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.

Abstract Introduction It is known that infants with viral respiratory infections severe enough to require hospital admission have a high risk of developing recurrent wheezing. Few data have been published on unselected populations. The main aim of this study was to analyse symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections during the first year of life in a cohort of infants, recruited at birth, and the development of recurrent wheezing. Patients and methods A total of 302 newborns were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken when the patients had a respiratory infection, as well as in the visits for vaccination at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. RT-nested PCR assays were performed to detect 16 viruses. Results A total of 1,293 samples were analysed (1,005 healthy controls and 288 respiratory infections). Samples taken during routine check-ups were positive in 30.8% of cases, while those with respiratory infection were positive in 77.8%, P \u003C.001 (OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.4-3.8). A total of 239 (79%) infants had at least 1 positive respiratory viral infection detected. The most frequent virus (71%) was rhinovirus (RV). Recurrent wheezing was found in 27 (11%) children during their first year of life (1.2 episodes, SD 2.9). Recurrent wheezing was present in 58.3% of patients admitted to hospital during their first viral infection, vs. 8.6% of infants when the first infection was mild or who had asymptomatic viral detection, P \u003C.001 (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.05-4.5). Conclusions In our series, severe respiratory infections leading to hospitalisation in the first months of life are risk factors for developing wheezing, but not in the case of mild RV infections.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvo, Cristina; Aguado, Isabel; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Ruiz-Chercoles, Esther; D\u00EDaz-Martinez, Eloisa; Alba\u00F1il, Rosa Mar\u00EDa; Campelo, Olga; Olivas, Antonio; Mu\u00F1\u00F3z-Gonzalez, Luisa; Pozo, Francisco; Fernandez-Arroyo, Rosa; Fernandez-Rinc\u00F3n, Adelaida; Calderon, Ana; Casas, Inmaculada","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57187437fad015cfa48ce55168ac6e60c9f687a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S169540331630248X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S169540331630248X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pacientes"],"organizations":["Un","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive respiratory viral infection","viral respiratory infections severe","asymptomatic respiratory viral infections","severe respiratory infections","infecciones respiratorias leves","infecciones respiratorias virales graves en los primeros meses","vida en una cohorte","muestras tomadas en los controles","forma peri\u00F3dica en los controles","salud y","total","infecciones respiratorias virales sintom\u00E1ticas y asintom\u00E1ticas","development of recurrent wheezing","riesgo para desarrollar sibilancias recurrentes","se detectaron sibilancias recurrentes durante su primer a\u00F1o","Conclusiones En nuestra serie","Se estudiaron","asymptomatic viral detection","Patients","los ni\u00F1os cuando presentaron una infecci\u00F3n respiratoria y","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n Las infecciones respiratorias virales que requieren hospitalizaci\u00F3n parecen conferir riesgo","los lactantes cuya primera infecci\u00F3n respiratoria requiri\u00F3 hospitalizaci\u00F3n desarrollaron sibilancias","case of mild RV infections","virus respiratorios mediante reacci\u00F3n en cadena","Pacientes y m\u00E9todos Se incluyeron","menos una detecci\u00F3n viral positiva durante","vida supusieron","mayor riesgo","year of life","cohort of infants","months of life","los ni\u00F1os cuya primera infecci\u00F3n fue leve o asintom\u00E1tica","Resultados Se analizaron","pero existen pocos datos publicados en poblaciones","reci\u00E9n nacidos","Se recogi\u00F3 aspirado nasofar\u00EDngeo","frente","lactantes tuvieron","frequent virus","samples","salud fueron positivas","high risk","hospital admission","risk factors","virus m\u00E1s frecuentemente identificado","Nuestro objetivo principal fue analizar si","RT-nested PCR assays","suponen","seleccionadas por tener factores","diferente gravedad","polimerasa","repetici\u00F3n","hospitalisation","study","birth","mismo","healthy controls","series","routine check-ups","episodes","methods","Conclusions","ocurri\u00F3","cases","data","unselected populations","main aim","nasopharyngeal aspirate","SD","newborns","Abstract Introduction","children","rhinovirus","rinovirus","visits","vaccination","viruses","episodios","lC"],"language":"en"},

Setting 81 countries, between March 24 and April 10, 2020. Participants 714 maternal and newborn healthcare providers. Main outcome measures Preparedness for and response to COVID-19, experiences of health workers providing care to women and newborns, and adaptations to 17 outpatient and inpatient care processes during the pandemic. Results Only one third of respondents received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, only 47% of participants in LMICs, and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing, and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based. Conclusions Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19.

The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change.

The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions. A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude \u03C1 will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude \u03C1, and of the resulting effective reproduction number RE. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities f (infection fatality risk) and \u03C1 (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of f lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing f, and/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular f, should be highly prioritized.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for con- trolling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by Rc), is less than unity. This equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable, for a special case of the model where quarantined-susceptible individuals do not acquire COVID-19 infection during quarantine, when Rc is less than unity. The epidemiological consequence of this theoretical result is that, the community-wide implementation of control interventions that can bring (and maintain) Rc to a value less than unity will lead to the effective control (or elimination) of COVID-19 in the community. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on baseline levels of interventions) are 105, 100 for New York state and 164, 000 for the entire US by the end of the pandemic. These numbers dramatically decreased by 80% and 64%, respectively, if adherence to strict social-distancing measures is improved and maintained until the end of May or June. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distance measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy \u2265 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ngonghala, Calistus N; Iboi, Enahoro; Eikenberry, Steffen; Scotch, Matthew; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Bonds, Matthew H; Gumel, Abba B","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/551e4b2872e4dc170676066fe6e064352805cbe4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066480","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["burden of COVID","pandemic burden","masks coverage","strict social-distancing measures","surgical masks","use of low efficacy masks","anti-COVID","strict social-distancing strategy","low efficacy cloth masks","masks-based intervention","strict social-distance measures","use of efficacious face-masks","adherence level of social","significant reduction of COVID","distancing protocols","burden similar","important role social-distancing plays","timely implementation of social","elimination","US state of New York","estimated efficacy","use of face","entire US","new mathematical model","Rc","residents of New York state","effective control","community transmission","devastating public health impact","intervention strategies","coverage level","community-wide implementation of control interventions","aforementioned control","baseline levels of interventions","population-level impact","improved levels","mitigation strategies","study","end","non-pharmaceutical interventions","transmission dynamics","early termination","effective vaccine","dramatic reduction","epidemiological consequence","theoretical result","disease-free equilibrium","certain epidemiological threshold","cumulative mortality","isolation","data relevant","relaxation","contact-tracing","numerous states","quarantined-susceptible individuals","worst-case scenario projections","antivirals","special case","world","catastrophic outcome","onset","respect","wave","decreases","reproduction number","future trajectory","absence","timing","infection","duration","Rigorous analysis","Simulations","novel Coronavirus","value","compliance","numbers"],"language":"en"},

The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. This data has triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study\u0027s data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original papers claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The original data; 2) Data including patients who deteriorated; 3) Data including patients who deteriorated with exclusion of untested patients in the comparison group; 4) Data that includes patients who deteriorated with the assumption that untested patients were negative. To ask if HCQ monotherapy is effective, we performed an A/B test for a model which assumes a positive effect, compared to a model of no effect. We find that the statistical evidence is highly sensitive to these data variants. Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients\u0027 consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ monotherapy group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hulme, Oliver J; Wagenmakers, Eric-Jan; Damkier, Per; Madelung, Christopher Fugl; Siebner, Hartwig Roman; Helweg-Larsen, Jannik; Gronau, Quentin; Benfield, Thomas Lars; Madsen, Kristoffer H","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c879280f8b43c5c855740694dc10657bda781bc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048777","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gautret"],"organizations":["HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original data","data variants","BF","exclusion of untested patients","study\u0027s data integrity","statistical evidence","positive effect model","anecdotal evidence","original papers","HCQ monotherapy group","moderate evidence","anecdotal negative evidence","potential clinical efficacy of HCQ","statistical analyses","statistical uncertainty","treatment of severe COVID","effects of hydroxychloroquine","clinical outcomes","dual treatment","main claims","effects of different assumptions","azithromycin","clinical decision-making","test outcomes","fact","viral load measurements","Randomised controlled trials","greater weight","greater certainty","comparison group","significant virus","B test","upper respiratory tract of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","different care centres","non-randomised open-label case series","enhanced virus reduction","patients\u0027 consent","multiple reversals","results","evidential support","SARS-CoV","confounding variables","colleagues","robustness","candidates","experimental design","subject","substantive changes","drugs","tests","Bayesian statistics","Gautret","treatments","speculation","authors","questions"],"language":"en"},

As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients\u0027 last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients\u0027 PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%). Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xun; Wang, Luwen; Yan, Shaonan; Yang, Fan; Xiang, Longkui; Zhu, Jiling; Shen, Bo; Gong, Zuojiong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c94f582610453b6c1389c3a5d6ad57bcf0ba033.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","SAA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["death of patients","severe patients","dyed patients","ill patients of COVID","death of COVID","cases of COVID","heart diseases","kidney diseases","SAA levels","CRP","LDH levels","common organ damage","levels of lymphocytes","infectious disease","underlying diseases","clinical characteristics of death cases","clinical records","patients\u0027 PCT","indicators of disease progression","neutrophil counts","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","D-Dimer","pneumonia","China","cTnI","test of neutrophils","hypertension","lymphocyte counts","liver","diabetes","Multiple organ dysfunction","laboratory findings","important role","mean age","rising of neutrophils","decline of lymphocytes","electronic medical records","important risk factors","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","radiologic assessments","computed tomography","chest X-ray","white blood cell","dead","examination","novel coronavirus","years","COPD","average course","Methods","lungs","SARS-CoV","Bacterial infections","Hubei Province","Interpretation","Malnutrition","days","experienced clinicians","data","Summary Background","study","respiratory failure","percentages","total","cerebral infarction","malignant tumors","acute pancreatitis","mortality"],"language":"en"},

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre on March 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern Madrid. During March 2020 highly active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was experienced in Madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by March 29th. Methods Since the beginning of the epidemics the Occupational Health and Safety Service (OHSS) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the Microbiology Laboratory by automatized specific PCR methods that was operative from February 25th as part of the preparedness. Results From a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 %) were tested during the period 1-29 March 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). The first HCW infected was confirmed on March 9th. A total of 791 HCW and personnel were confirmed to be infected by March 29th, representing 38% of those tested and 11,6 % of all the hospital workers. The proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between HCW and those patients attending at the Emergency Department (ER) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR detection between HCW from high risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. The curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and HCW during March 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. Discussion The recommendation from our OHSS did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of HCW and non-sanitary personnel was tested in March 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in Madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 % of the hospital employees. Most of the COVID-19 cases among the hospital HCW and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3%) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. No fatalities occurred during the study period. Although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of HCW and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. Furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (March 2020) between patients attending the ER and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. This experience is similar to the communicated from Wuhan verified by the WHO Joint Mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the Netherlands, where most of the infections of HCW were related to household or community contacts. Significance Since the collective of hospital HCW are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for SARS-CoV-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. There appears to be a close connection between HCW infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. Although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. Exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 % is a minimum estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. This is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. This has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment, treatment and recovery.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Folgueira, Maria Dolores; Munoz-Ruiperez, Carmen; Alonso-Lopez, Miguel Angel; Delgado, Rafael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20055723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Occupational Health and Safety Service","HCW","ICU","WHO Joint Mission"],"locations":["Germany","Canary Islands","southern Madrid","Madrid"],"keyphrases":["hospital personnel","collective of hospital HCW","patients","HCW infected","hospital employees","evolution of cases","hospital staff","Hospital Universitario","hospital workers","infections of HCW","high proportion of HCW","infection rates of HCW","accumulated cases","suspected cases","case of COVID","testing of asymptomatic cases","large public hospital","laboratory personnel","SARS-CoV","proportion of SARS","confirmed exposure","epidemics","time period","study period","non-sanitary personnel","rate of infection","areas of high exposure risk","imported case","southern Madrid","total samples","high risk areas","proportion of infected individuals","rapid period of expansion","OHSS","different groups of occupational exposure","significant differences","active circulation of SARS","molecular diagnosis of SARS","curves of evolution","epidemic dynamics","automatized specific PCR methods","presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection","Microbiology Laboratory","minor symptoms","close contact","Occupational Health","direct contact","specific centers","community contacts","positive PCR detection","expansive epidemic wave","Safety Service","Germany","home","recent experiences","oropharyngeal swabs","comparison","clerical","consulting","severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia","Wuhan","Joint Mission","Canary Islands","beds","Netherlands","beginning","household","Spain","probable transmission","self-isolation measures","hospitalization","inhabitants","mechanical ventilation","ICU","Octubre","Emergency Department","indicator","HCWs","accounting","Significance","Discussion","recommendation","phase","fatalities","Results","age range","parallel shape","Background","preparedness","community","HCW infection","additional risk factor of infection","hospital environment","evolutive wave of infection","actual number of cases","impact of SARS","similar proportions of positive cases","clear arguments","major factor of occupational risk","clear contrast","official figures","public health policies","containment","treatment","driving forces of transmission","areas","international levels","close connection","significant proportion of COVID","recovery","Madrid","minimum estimation","circulation","weeks","population","important implications","Exhaustive testing","reference","institution","workers"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of 2019-nCoV spike 1 protein (S1) and mediates viral entry into host cells. Despite the abundance of ACE2 in small intestine, few digestive symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of lectin-like intestinal defensin against 2019-nCoV, which may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Cheng; Wang, Shaobo; Li, Daixi; Zhao, Xia; Han, Songling; Wang, Tao; Zhao, Gaomei; Chen, Yin; Chen, Fang; Zhao, Jianqi; Wang, Liting; Sun, Wei; Huang, Yi; Su, Yongping; Wei, Dongqing; Zhao, Jinghong; Wang, Junping","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c8ac295acf684a385eb45d0b37710affa3a9e85.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.013490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV S1 binding","nCoV spike","nCoV infection","bound ACE2","abundance of ACE2","intestinal epithelial cells","intestinal Paneth cells","ligand-binding domain of ACE2","intestinal defensin","cloak of HD5","host cells","remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5","innate defense function of lectin","small intestine","treatment","HDs","digestive symptoms","high affinity","viral entry","nM","human defensins","novel coronavirus","new insights","prevention","HD6","subsequent recruitment","protein","molecular dynamic simulation","burgeoning epidemic","findings","interactions","patients","receptor","enzyme","global concern","Angiotensin","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Design: cohort study and self-controlled cohort crossover study Setting: routinely collected administrative and healthcare data with individual-level linkage between several national registries in Sweden. Participants: older persons (\u003E65 years) living in the community whose spouse died in 2013-2014, individually matched with controls. Main outcome measures: death from any cause (primary outcome), acute cardiovascular events, pneumonia, hip fracture, and intentional self-harm (secondary outcomes). In the cohort study, incidence rate ratios were estimated with conditional fixed-effect Poisson regression models adjusted for potential confounders. In the self-controlled cohort crossover study, relative incidence ratios were estimated over the 12 months before and after spousal loss with unadjusted conditional fixed-effect Poisson regression including a bereavement-by-time interaction. Results: 42 918 bereaved older spouses were included and matched to an equal number of married controls (mean age 78.9 [SD 7.2] years, 68% women). During the first year of follow-up, the risk of death from any cause was 1.66 (95% confidence interval 1.53 to 1.80) times higher for bereaved cases than for married controls, and bereaved cases survived on average 4.2 days shorter than married controls. Bereaved cases also experienced an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events (incidence rate ratio 1.34, 1.24 to 1.44), hip fracture (1.48, 1.30 to 1.68), pneumonia (1.14, 1.04 to 1.25), and self-harm (3.49, 2.11 to 5.76). These associations were strongly time-dependent, increasing sharply immediately after spousal loss and weakening as time elapsed. In the self-controlled cohort crossover study, the relative incidence ratios increased for all four secondary outcomes, starting already during the 6-month period preceding spousal loss. Conclusion: Among older persons, the association between spousal bereavement and the risk of negative health outcomes and mortality is most likely causal. Our finding that the risk of adverse health consequences increases already during the 6 months prior to spousal loss indicates that palliative care services have an important role to play in providing timely bereavement care to spouses and other family caregivers.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morin, Lucas; Wastesson, Jonas W; Fors, Stefan; Agahi, Neda; Johnell, Kristina","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d600d07469f8268d91c9790b6fa39607b6a5f89b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067645","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["cohort study","spousal bereavement","risk of death","risk of negative health outcomes","bereaved cases","self-controlled cohort crossover study Setting","bereaved older spouses","relative incidence ratios","incidence rate ratios","secondary outcomes","older persons","increased risk of acute cardiovascular events","month period preceding spousal loss","risk of adverse health consequences","older people","timely bereavement care","equal number of married controls","hip fracture","cause","months","years","pneumonia","time-dependent","time elapsed","time interaction","conditional fixed-effect Poisson regression models","unadjusted conditional fixed-effect Poisson regression","intentional self-harm","primary outcome","palliative care services","Main outcome measures","individual-level linkage","mean age","mortality","average","healthcare data","important role","days shorter","times higher","national registries","potential confounders","SD","Design","Sweden","confidence interval","finding","Results","family caregivers","year of follow-up","community","associations","Participants","Conclusion","Objective","women"],"language":"en"},

Further, existing protocols are designed for testing the fit and performance N95 respirators and tight-fitting facemasks rather than the relatively more loose-fitting surgical mask style most cloth masks follow. In this study tools and methods typically used to assess tight-fitting facemasks were modified to assess the efficacy of community-produced fabric and commercially-produced surgical masks in terms of protecting the wearer from airborne particles that may be carrying virus. Two TSI PortaCount (model 8028) instruments were operated concurrently to collect particle counts (particles/cm^3) in size range 0.02 to \u003E1 um from ambient air and air just inside the breathing zone of the mask (1 measurement per second, evaluation period of 1 minute per test). Percent particle removal was determined for ten home-made, fabric masks of different designs, with and without filter layers, as well as three commercially-produced surgical-type masks. N95 masks were used to validate the method, and a 3M model 1826 surgical mask was used as a baseline for comparison of other masks of this style. Home-made masks worn as designed always had lower particle removal rates than the 3M masks, achieving between 38% and 96% of this baseline. As has been previously observed by Cooper et al. (1983), adding a layer of nylon stocking over the masks minimized the flow of air around the edges of the masks and improved particle filtration efficiency for all masks, including all commercial products tested. Use of a nylon stocking overlayer brought the particle filtration efficiency for five of the ten fabric masks above the 3M surgical mask baseline. This rapid testing method (\u003C2 hours per mask design) provides a holistic evaluation of mask particle removal efficacy (material, design, and fit), and use of this method for testing a wider range of mask materials and designs will provide the public and health care providers with information needed to optimize health protection given resources at hand.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mueller, A.

Within the overlap, ORF2b lacks an AUG translational start codon and is therefore presumably translated by -1 ribosomal frameshifting as a transframe protein with ORF2a. This hypothesis was studied by introducing the putative frameshift region into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and testing for the occurrence of frameshifting in vivo by transient expression of GUS activity in potato protoplasts as well as in vitro by translation in the reticulocyte system. Both experimental approaches demonstrate that a -1 frameshift occurs at a frequency of approximately 1%. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the frameshift region and the involvement of the novel heptanucleotide motif UUUAAAU in conjunction with an adjacent stem-loop structure. Part of this stem-loop encodes a basic region in the ORF2b moiety of the transframe protein which was shown by binding experiments with PLRV RNA to represent a nucleic acid-binding domain.

The clinical appearance and histopathology of avridine-induced arthritis show great similarity to other arthritis models such as collagen-induced arthritis. In LEW and DA rats the avridine-induced arthritis is severe and long lasting. To investigate a possible genetic influence on the disease we compared LEW, DA and E3 rats, which are of different genetic origins, for their ability to develop arthritis after injection of a low dose of avridine (1.5 mg/rat). The E3 rat was shown to be resistant, whereas all of the DA rats developed arthritis. Recombinant inbred strains derived from DA and E3 parentals varied in susceptibility to avridine. Only strains sharing RT1av1 with DA developed arthritis, indicating a role for the MHC genes. The MHC association was further analysed in a series of Lewis congenic strains using the 1.5 mg avridine dose. All strains developed arthritis. LEW.1C and LEW.1W developed only acute arthritis, whereas LEW.1A, LEW, LEW.1D, LEW.1N and LEW.1F developed chronic arthritis. In particular, the LEW.1F rats developed a chronic severe arthritis of high incidence. The chronic arthritis showed an active, erosive joint inflammation several months after induction. Nude rats are resistant to avridine-induced arthritis, indicating a T cell dependence of the disease which supports the importance of MHC. However, non-MHC genes are also crucial to arthritis development. Recombinants between DA and E3, sharing RT1av1 with DA, showed either a lower incidence or a lower severity of disease than the DA rats. The E3 rat and the recombinants with RT1u were completely resistant, whereas LEW.1W, also RT1u, were highly susceptible.","publish_time":"1995-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vingsbo, C; Jonsson, R; Holmdahl, R","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1534209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["LEW","DA","MHC","LEW.1A","LEW.1D"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic arthritis","avridine-induced arthritis","arthritis models","acute arthritis","arthritis development","DA rats","collagen-induced arthritis","E3 rats","chronic severe arthritis of high incidence","avridine dose","rat strains","histopathology of avridine","F rats","Nude rats","low dose of avridine","E3 parentals","MHC association","importance of MHC","Recombinant inbred strains","non-MHC genes","lower severity of disease","lower incidence","RT1u","series of Lewis congenic strains","Recombinants","RT1av1","different genetic origins","possible genetic influence","erosive joint inflammation","great similarity","months","ability","injection","T cell dependence","induction","potent synthetic adjuvant","susceptibility","role","clinical appearance"],"language":"en"},

An antibody specific for DPAP B recognizes a 120-kD glycoprotein in yeast that behaves like an integral membrane protein in that it is not removed from membranes by high pH Na2CO3 treatment. Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence of DPAP B reveals a hydrophobic domain near the NH2 terminus that could potentially span a lipid bilayer. The in vitro enzymatic activity and apparent molecular weight of DPAP B are unaffected by the allelic state of PEP4, a gene essential for the proteolytic activation of a number of soluble vacuolar hydrolases. DPAP B is synthesized as a glycosylated precursor that is converted to the mature 120-kD species by carbohydrate addition. The precursor form of DPAP B accumulates in sec mutants (Novick, P., C. Field, and R. Schekman. 1980. Cell. 21:205-215) that are blocked at the ER (sec18) or Golgi apparatus (sec7), but not at secretory vesicles (sec1). Immunolocalization of DPAP B in wild-type or sec1 mutant cells shows that the protein resides in the vacuolar membrane. However, it is present in non-vacuolar compartments in sec18 and sec7 cells, confirming that the delivery of DPAP B is blocked in these mutants. Interestingly, DPAP B appears to stain the nuclear envelope in a sec18 mutant, which is consistent with the accumulation of DPAP B in the ER membrane at the restrictive temperature. These results suggest that soluble and membrane-bound vacuolar proteins use the same stages of the secretory pathway for their transport.","publish_time":"1989-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7a5f2d3cff5287f3c65c24cb77de1caf5872687.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

To examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly, we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes. Fusion of a cis-Golgi retention signal from a coronavirus E1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the Golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface, resulting in efficient transformation. All chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly. Derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence, using antibodies that distinguish between the extracellular PDGF-related domain and the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. Colocalization of sis-E1-G with Golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early Golgi complex. The sis-E1 constructs, targeted to the early Golgi complex, exhibited no proteolytic processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-E1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing. Treatment with suramin, a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-E1 constructs described here. Our results demonstrate that autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and PDGF receptors within the early Golgi complex do not result in functional signal transduction. Another v-sis fusion protein was constructed by attaching the transmembrane domain and COOH-terminus of TGN38, a protein that localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This construct was primarily retained intracellularly, although some of the fusion protein reached the surface. Deletion of the COOH-terminal region of the TGN38 retention signal abrogated the TGN-localization, as evidenced by very prominent cell surface localization, and resulted in increased transforming activity. The behavior of the sis-TGN38 derivatives is discussed within the context of the properties of TGN38 itself, which is known to recycle from the cell surface to the TGN.","publish_time":"1994-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0813fe3f70fb9a52ec5944b43bdd953a08cc49a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDGF","Golgi","TGN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["v-sis protein","v-sis fusion protein","Colocalization of sis","v-sis oncoprotein","sis-TGN38 derivatives","mutant sis-E1 constructs","early Golgi complex","mutant forms of sis","E1-G","Golgi markers","fusion proteins","cis-Golgi retention signal","TGN38 retention signal","prominent cell surface localization","receptor interactions","trans-Golgi network","TGN-localization","coronavirus E1 glycoprotein","receptor-ligand interactions","PDGF receptors","properties of TGN38","location of autocrine interactions","VSV-G cytoplasmic tail","functional signal transduction","chimeric proteins","extracellular PDGF-related domain","examination of subcellular localization","normal proteolytic processing","transmembrane domain","COOH-terminus","transforming ability","COOH-terminal region","increased transforming activity","glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus","targeting","polyanionic compound","double-label immunofluorescence","antibodies","transformed phenotype","context","specific intracellular membranes","mutations","Treatment","suramin","NIH3T3 cells","Deletion","efficient transformation","behavior","results"],"language":"en"},

This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans- Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans- TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL- containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.","publish_time":"1994-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e14c267f2323c8a137e2698dcf29a87713898166.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120279/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NRK","KDEL","HeLa","TGN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGN marker","mammalian KDEL receptor","trans- TGN","HeLa cells","retrieval of KDEL","Golgi stack","intermediate compartment","ER localization","normal cells","exact compartment","mouse hepatitis virus","vaccinia virus","different compartments","multiple post-ER compartments","rough ER","significant shift","GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells","degrees C treatment","carboxyl-terminal sequence","trans- Golgi network","vesicular stomatitis virus","mouse spermatids","retrieval signal","sequence functions","related sequence","excellent marker","vesicles","physiological conditions","stress conditions","thawed cryosections of different tissues","carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp","subcellular localization","membrane proteins","small amounts","exocytotic pathway","infection","immunogold","lumenal","budding profiles","Glu-Leu","structures distal","rat pancreas","antibody","NRK","MHV","distribution","buds","type","beta-COP","Vero","affinity","rab1","results"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino- 1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms. Further, ceramide accumulation reveals this cycle by upsetting the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic and/ or disrupting retention by altering bilayer dynamics.","publish_time":"1997-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maceyka, Michael; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f39b51bbd9ece044b1af4f83b6ff05053810e7d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2132625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2132625/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV M","IBV M."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["localization of IBV","proper localization","Golgi complex","effects of PDMP","ceramide accumulation","concentration of PDMP","Golgi markers","conversion of ceramide","cellular ceramide","inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis","cis-Golgi network","PDMP-induced alterations","PDMP-treated cells","Golgi stack proteins","steady-state distribution of IBV","site of sphingolipid synthesis","ongoing synthesis","membrane lipids","upstream inhibitors","protein transmembrane domains","Short-term treatment","infectious bronchitis virus","avian coronavirus","specific interactions","retention","retrograde traffic","balance of anterograde","cycle","information","perturbation of sphingolipids","threo","glycoprotein","glucosylceramide","morpholino","phenyl","decanoylamino","bilayer dynamics","Pretreatment","sphingomyelin","increase","ERGIC","propanol","retrieval mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2.

By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic \u03B2 cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6\u2013phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by \u223C90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in \u03B2 cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595\u2013608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrin-coated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide\u2013sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997. Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261\u20131271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR\u2013ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.","publish_time":"1998-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klumperman, Judith; Kuliawat, Regina; Griffith, Janice M.; Geuze, Hans J.; Arvan, Peter","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccfba5ba6e11eff35a72dead3fac7f7daebda11d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2148452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2148452/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

The eye contains a variety of cells expressing vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs), and their receptors, located in the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process, and the retina. VNs are important activators of adenylate cyclase, deriving cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Impairment of VN function would arguably impede cAMP production and impede utilization of ATP.

Methods: Retrospective study of critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) at ICU. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes were collected using a case report form. Results: Critical illness occurred in 61 patients admitted to an ICU with confirmed (n=45) or probable and suspected 2009 influenza A(H1N1). Patients were young (mean, 41.5 years), were female (54%). Fifty-six patients, required mechanical ventilation (14 invasive, 27 noninvasive, 15 both) during the course of ICU. On admission, mean APACHE II score was 18.7\u00B16.3 and median PaO(2)/FIO(2) was 127.9\u00B170.4. 31 patients (50.8%) was die.

Quantitative disorders (hyposmia, anosmia) are distinguished from qualitative disorders (parosmia, phantosmia).

In ENT patients olfactory disorders caused by sinonasal diseases are the most common ones, followed by postviral disorders. Therapy consists of topical and systemic steroids, whereas systemic application seems to be of greater value. It is very difficult to predict the improvement of olfactory function using surgery, moreover, the long term - success in surgery is questionable. Isolated taste disorders are rare and in most often caused by underlying diseases or side effects of medications. A meticulous history is necessary and helps to choose effective treatment. In selected cases zinc might be useful.","publish_time":"2005-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Welge-L\u00FCssen, Antje","journal":"GMS Curr Top Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ea88246c467b56b00c2a792dbf3120299a624c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3201003.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ENT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["qualitative disorders","Quantitative disorders","postviral disorders","incidence of olfactory disorders","ENT patients olfactory disorders","Isolated taste disorders","surgery","underlying diseases","improvement of olfactory function","therapy","sinonasal diseases","systemic application","systemic steroids","underlying pathophysiology","common ones","anosmia","long term - success","selected cases zinc","effects of medications","parosmia","phantosmia","hyposmia","greater value","meticulous history","effective treatment","etiology","quality of life"],"language":"en"},

The effects of integrative TCM/WM treatment have not been fully quantified. OBJECTIVES: To systematically asses the treatment effects of integrated TCM with WM versus WM alone in patients with SARS, incorporating data from recently published studies. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted, using published randomized and nonrandomized controlled clinical studies that compared the treatment effects of integrative TCM/WM with WM alone from 2002 to 2006. The outcome measurements included mortality rate, cure rate, resolution of pulmonary infiltrate, use of corticosteroid, and time to defervescence. The effect sizes were presented as risk ratio (RR), rate difference (RD), and weighted mean difference (WMD). The pooled effect sizes were calculated by both fixed-effects and random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 1,678 patients with a diagnosis of SARS were identified, including 866 patients from 16 randomized controlled studies and 812 patients from 8 nonrandomized controlled studies. There were no differences detected in mortality rate or cure rate between treatments. Compared with patients receiving WM treatment alone, patients receiving integrative treatment were more likely to have complete or partial resolution of pulmonary infiltrate (RD=0.18, 95%CI; 0.07 to 0.30), lower average daily dosage (mg) of corticosteroid (WMD=-60.27, 95% CI; -70.58 to -49.96), higher CD4\u002B counts (cells/uL) (WMD=167.96, 95% CI; 109.68 to 226.24), and shorter time to defervescence (days) (WMD= -1.06, 95%CI;-1.60 to -0.53). CONCLUSIONS: The experience of integrative TCM/WM in the treatment of SARS is encouraging. The use of TCM as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of SARS should be further investigated.","publish_time":"2007-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yan; Guo, Jeff J.; Healy, Daniel P; Zhan, Siyan","journal":"Pharm Pract (Granada)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/756dbc931627ce595e70224e084e8cb89d38287c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4155143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","TCM","TCM/WM","WM","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WM treatment","treatment of SARS","patients","treatment effects of integrative TCM","treatment effects of integrated TCM","treatment efficacy of integrative treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine","experience of integrative TCM","use of TCM","WMD","cure rate","mortality rate","rate difference","published studies","nonrandomized controlled studies","diagnosis of SARS","nonrandomized controlled clinical studies","random-effects models","RD","Data","corticosteroid","defervescence","partial resolution of pulmonary infiltrate","pooled effect sizes","Western Medicine","shorter time","weighted mean difference","risk ratio","cells","RR","asses","adjunctive therapy","outcome measurements","counts","days","treatments","higher CD4","lower average daily dosage","meta-analysis","total","BACKGROUND","differences","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

However, clinical and epidemiological data are limited. METHODS: Four outpatient clinics and three hospitals submitted clinical data and respiratory specimens through a surveillance network for acute respiratory infection (ARI) during May 2013 through December 2016. Specimens were tested using multi-target nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for 19\u201322 respiratory pathogens, including influenza C. RESULTS: Influenza C virus was detected among 59 of 10,202 (0.58%) hospitalized SARI cases and 11 of 2,282 (0.48%) outpatients. Most detections occurred from December to March, with 73% during the 2014\u20132015 season. Influenza C detections occurred among patients of all ages, with similar rates between inpatients and outpatients. The highest rate of detection occurred among children aged 6 to 24 months (1.2%). Among hospitalized cases, seven required intensive care. Medical co-morbidities were reported in 58% of hospitalized cases and all who required intensive care. At least one other respiratory pathogen was detected in 40 (66%) cases, most commonly rhinovirus/enterovirus (25%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (20%). The hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) gene was sequenced in 37 specimens, and both C/Kanagawa and C/Sao Paulo lineages were detected in inpatients and outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: We found seasonal circulation of influenza C with year-to-year variability. Detection was most frequent among young children, but occurred in all ages. Some cases positive for influenza C, particularly those with co-morbid conditions, had severe disease, suggesting a need for further study of the role of influenza C virus in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thielen, Beth K.; Friedlander, Hannah; Bistodeau, Sarah; Shu, Bo; Lynch, Brian; Martin, Karen; Bye, Erica; Como-Sabetti, Kathyrn; Boxrud, David; Strain, Anna K.; Chaves, Sandra S.; Steffens, Andrea; Fowlkes, Ashley L.; Lindstrom, Stephen; Lynfield, Ruth","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/826199b710b661d8c727eadc38f0b33fabcffe4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5862734.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/66/7/1092/24398190/cix931.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069373/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix931","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza C detections","respiratory specimens","role of influenza C virus","seasonal circulation of influenza C","respiratory pathogens","hospitalized cases","pathogenesis of respiratory disease","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory infection","mild respiratory tract disease","cases positive","SARI cases","outpatients","severe disease","inpatients","clinical data","required intensive care","young children","year variability","epidemiological data","co-morbid conditions","highest rate of detection","Medical co-morbidities","surveillance network","multi-target nucleic acid amplification tests","NAAT","hospitals","Kanagawa","RESULTS","Sao Paulo lineages","outpatient clinics","similar rates","fusion","HEF","need","Existing literature","study","hemagglutinin-esterase","BACKGROUND","RSV","enterovirus","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","rhinovirus","months"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to live poultry was believed to be the major route of infection. There are limited data on how the general public changes their practices regarding live poultry exposure in response to the early outbreak of this novel influenza and the frequency of population exposure to live poultry in different areas of China. METHODOLOGY: This study investigated population exposures to live birds from various sources during the outbreak of H7N9 in Guangzhou city, China in 2013 and compared them with those observed during the 2006 influenza A(H5N1) outbreak. Adults were telephone-interviewed using two-stage sampling, stratified by three residential areas of Guangzhou: urban areas and two semi-rural areas in one of which (Zengcheng) A(H7N9) virus was detected in a chicken from wet markets. Logistic regression models were built to describe practices protecting against avian influenza, weighted by age and gender, and then compare these practices across residential areas in 2013 with those from a comparable 2006 survey. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 1196 respondents, 45% visited wet markets at least daily and 22.0% reported buying live birds from wet markets at least weekly in April-May, 2013, after the H7N9 epidemic was officially declared in late March 2013. Of those buying live birds, 32.3% reported touching birds when buying and 13.7% would slaughter the poultry at home. Although only 10.1% of the respondents reported raising backyard birds, 92.1% of those who did so had physical contact with the birds they raised. Zengcheng respondents were less likely to report buying live birds from wet markets, but more likely to buy from other sources when compared to urban respondents. Compared with the 2006 survey, the prevalence of buying live birds from wet markets, touching when buying and slaughtering birds at home had substantially declined in the 2013 survey. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Although population exposures to live poultry were substantially fewer in 2013 compared to 2006, wet markets and backyard poultry remained the two major sources of live bird exposures for the public in Guangzhou in 2013. Zengcheng residents seemed to have reduced buying live birds from wet markets but not from other sources in response to the detection of H7N9 virus in wet markets.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Qiuyan; Yuan, Jun; Lau, Eric H.

A literature search for studies involving the seven isolated tanshinone hits showed that at present, none have been identified as coronaviral protease inhibitors. We have identified that all of the isolated tanshinones are good inhibitors of both cysteine proteases. However, their activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure and targeting enzymes. All isolated compounds (1\u20137) act as time dependent inhibitors of PLpro, but no improved inhibition was observed following preincubation with the 3CLpro. In a detail kinetic mechanism study, all of the tanshinones except rosmariquinone (7) were identified as noncompetitive enzyme isomerization inhibitors. However, rosmariquinone (7) showed a different kinetic mechanism through mixed-type simple reversible slow-binding inhibition. Furthermore, tanshinone I (5) exhibited the most potent nanomolar level inhibitory activity toward deubiquitinating (IC50 =0.7\u03BCM). Additionally, the inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other proteases including chymotrysin, papain, and HIV protease.

Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the types of aminopeptidase activities in human nasal mucosa. Methods: Human nasal mucosa was homogenized (n = 12), and cytoplasmic (S2) and membrane-rich (P2) fractions were obtained. Several aminopeptidase (Ap) activities were defined by (1) substrate specificity with leucine-enkephalin (leu-Ap) and alanine-nitroanilide (ala-Ap), (2) inhibitor studies with puromycin and bestatin, (3) enzyme activity histochemistry (zymography), (4) immunohistochemistry, and (5) gel electrophoresis. Human volunteers had methacholine, histamine, and allergen nasal provocations to determine the mechanisms controlling nasal aminopeptidase secretion in vivo. Results: P2 was the largest reservoir of puromycin-resistant aminopeptidase activity (630 pmol leu-enk/min/mg protein). S2 contained 32 pmol leu-enk/min/mg activity, with 80% representing puromycin-resistant activity and 20% puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PS-Ap). Ala-Ap was detected in both P2 and S2 fractions and was localized by zymography to epithelial and gland cells. Anti\u2013rat brain\u2013soluble PS-Ap IgG detected immunoreactive material in epithelium, glands, and endothelium. In nasal provocation studies, leu-AP correlated with glandular exocytosis but not vascular leak. Conclusions: The predominant aminopeptidase in human nasal epithelial and submucosal gland cells was membrane-bound puromycin-resistant aminopeptidase. A novel soluble puromycin-resistant aminopeptidase and lower amounts of soluble PS-Ap were also detected.

For coronaviruses, this critical step is governed by the virally-encoded spike (S) protein, a class I viral fusion protein that has several unique features. Coronavirus entry is unusual in that it is often biphasic in nature, and can occur at or near the cell surface or in late endosomes. Recent advances in structural, biochemical and molecular biology of the coronavirus S protein has shed light on the intricacies of coronavirus entry, in particular the molecular triggers of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, characterization of the coronavirus fusion peptide (FP), the segment of the fusion protein that inserts to a target lipid bilayer during membrane fusion, has revealed its particular attributes which imparts some of the unusual properties of the S protein, such as Ca2\u002B-dependency. These unusual characteristics can explain at least in part the biphasic nature of coronavirus entry. In this review, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as model virus, we give an overview of advances in research on the coronavirus fusion peptide with an emphasis on its role and properties within the biological context of host cell entry.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Millet, Jean Kaoru; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03b9bd26d49d3aa3b2d7669ad876b676cfd481c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112017.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29275820/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217304208; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217304208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus S protein","coronavirus fusion peptide","viral fusion protein","intricacies of coronavirus entry","biphasic nature of coronavirus entry","molecular triggers of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion","viral entry","unusual properties","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","biological context of host cell entry","host cell membranes","cell surface","unusual characteristics","molecular biology","lipid envelope","particular attributes","overview of advances","Recent advances","target lipid bilayer","SARS-CoV","light","enveloped viruses","role","research","emphasis","class","model virus","review","Abstract","segment","FP","unique features","late endosomes","Ca2","encoded spike","characterization","coronaviruses","critical step","dependency"],"language":"en"},

However, it remains largely unknown why virions prefer cholesterol-rich heterogeneous membranes to uniformly fluid membranes for membrane fusion. Using giant plasma membrane vesicles containing cholesterol-rich ordered and cholesterol-poor fluid lipid domains, we demonstrate that the HIV receptor CD4 is substantially sequestered into ordered domains, whereas the co-receptor CCR5 localizes preferentially at ordered/disordered domain boundaries. We also show that HIV does not fuse from within ordered regions of the plasma membrane but rather at their boundaries. Ordered/disordered lipid domain coexistence is not required for HIV attachment but is a prerequisite for successful fusion.

We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS. METHODS: We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data. RESULTS: With our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R(0) to be 0\u00B769 (95% CI 0\u00B750\u20130\u00B792); by contrast, the R(0) for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0\u00B780 (0\u00B754\u20131\u00B713). Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R(0) of 0\u00B760 (0\u00B742\u20130\u00B780). Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R(0) would exceed 1\u2014ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

GBS among Saudis has been seldom investigated, which leaves both clinicians and researchers with scarcity in knowledge. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence and clinical prognosis of GBS among pediatrics admitted with acute paralysis at a large healthcare facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed patients\u2019 medical records between 2005 and 2015. Eligible cases were children (\u003C14 years old) admitted to the hospital complaining of acute paralysis and later diagnosed with one form or variant of GBS. Pearson\u2019s chi-square, Fisher\u2019s exact test, and binary logistic regression were employed to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The prevalence of GBS was 49%. The male-to-female ratio was 1.45:1. The mean \u00B1 standard deviation age was 7\u00B13.7 years. There were 34 (69.4%) cases with progression to maximum paralysis in \u22642 weeks, while 15 (30.6%) cases occurred beyond 2 weeks. Males (n=24, 82.8%) were more likely to endure progression to maximum paralysis in \u22642 weeks after the disease onset, compared to females (n=10, 50%), P=0.014. All cases complaining of respiratory problems exhibited a progression to maximum paralysis in \u22642 weeks, compared to those with no respiratory problems, P=0.027. Residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset was highly associated with GBS patients of age 8\u201314 years (n=15, 65.2%), compared to younger patients (n=8, 30.8%), P=0.016. Patients admitted in colder seasons (n=14, 63.6%) were more likely to suffer residual paralysis too, compared to those in warmer seasons (n=9, 33.3%), P=0.035. GBS cases who complained of facial weakness (n=9, 75%) and ocular abnormalities (n=10, 71.4%) were also more likely to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset, P=0.025 and P=0.03, respectively. CONCLUSION: Male gender could be a determinant of rapid progression to maximum paralysis, while the older age group in pediatrics is expected to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset. GBS can be accounted as a rare disease, especially in pediatrics, so confirmed cases should be investigated comprehensively for research purposes.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asiri, Safiyyah; Altwaijri, Waleed A; Ba-Armah, Duaa; Al Rumayyan, Ahmed; Alrifai, Muhammad T; Salam, Mahmoud; Almutairi, Adel F","journal":"Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df638f8a7a456418b116ca93f6b20b9cd8c7f791.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6400135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880987/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s187994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson","Fisher"],"organizations":["GBS"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["maximum paralysis","Residual paralysis","acute paralysis","GBS cases","prevalence of GBS","GBS patients of age","variant of GBS","progressive acute form of paralysis","weeks","days post disease onset","Eligible cases","confirmed cases","clinical prognosis of GBS","pediatrics","rare disease","determinant of rapid progression","respiratory problems","years old","younger patients","older age group","standard deviation age","retrospective study","Male gender","colder seasons","warmer seasons","Fisher\u2019s exact test","large healthcare facility","binary logistic regression","Riyadh","Saudi Arabia","patients\u2019 medical records","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","Pearson\u2019s chi-square","children","hospital","facial weakness","immune-mediated process","clinicians","researchers","scarcity","knowledge","BACKGROUND","METHODS","mean","females","ocular abnormalities","female ratio","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","collected data","research purposes","Saudis"],"language":"en"},

We simulated cross infections due to respiratory diseases spread by large droplets using empirical data on contacts (ie, close-proximity interactions of \u22641m) in an ED to quantify risks due to contact and to examine factors with differential risks associated with them. DESIGN: Prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Health workers (HCWs) and patients. SETTING: A busy ED. METHODS: Data on contacts between participants were collected over 6 months by observing two 12-hour shifts per week using a radiofrequency identification proximity detection system. We simulated cross infection due to a novel agent across these contacts to determine risks associated with HCW role, chief complaint category, arrival mode, and ED disposition status. RESULTS: Cross-infection risk between HCWs was substantially greater than between patients or between patients and HCWs. Providers had the least risk, followed by nurses, and nonpatient care staff had the most risk. There were no differences by patient chief complaint category. We detected differential risk patterns by arrival mode and by HCW role. Although no differential risk was associated with ED disposition status, 0.1 infections were expected per shift among patients admitted to hospital. CONCLUSION: These simulations demonstrate that, on average, 11 patients who were infected in the ED will be admitted to the hospital over the course of an 8-week local influenza outbreak.

With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (\u003E95%) at 200 nM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 \u03BCM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.","publish_time":"2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shrestha, Aruna; Ojo, Kayode K.; Koston, Florian; Ruttkowski, B\u00E4rbel; Vidadala, Rama S.R.; Dorr, Carlie S.; Navaluna, Edelmar D.; Whitman, Grant R.; Barrett, Kayleigh F.; Barrett, Lynn K.; Hulverson, Matthew A.; Choi, Ryan; Michaels, Samantha A.; Maly, Dustin J.; Hemphill, Andrew; Van Voorhis, Wesley C.; Joachim, Anja","journal":"Int J Parasitol Drugs Drug Resist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/075c0ee81918f2e0158b9e1807c0a588f3e3949c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/46c3d464e9fb7f7ccffeae216e82fe33465074bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6453670.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959327/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211320719300454; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2019.03.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211320719300454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nM BKI","pharmacokinetics of BKI","plasma concentration of BKI","oral applications of BKI","toltrazuril-sensitive","available drug toltrazuril","toltrazuril-resistant","treated piglets","suckling piglets","suis strains","Cystoisospora suis CDPK1","constant drug accumulation","Wien","porcine cystoisosporosis","ease of drug handling","treatment frequencies","Five-day treatment","Holland","inhibited merozoite proliferation","exposure of infected cultures","cell culture","established animal infection model","negative effects","exposure of parasites","animal health","bumped kinase inhibitors","recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme","intestinal porcine epithelial cells","inhibiting host-cell invasion","calcium-dependent protein kinase","improved body weight gains","BKIs","suppressed oocyst excretion","surviving merozoites","thermal stabilization","efficacy","safety","leading diarrheal disease","apicomplexan species","parasite growth","substantial need","gene coding","structural alterations","novel therapeutics","pigs","future studies","days","\u03BCM","transmission electron microscopy","therapeutic alternative","use","comprehensive study","activity","IPEC","confirmation of resistance","BW"],"language":"en"},

Although a swine-origin H1N1 virus has emerged to become pandemic, its virulence for humans remains modest in comparison to that seen in zoonotic H5N1 disease. As human respiratory epithelium is the primary target cells for influenza viruses, elucidating the viral tropism and host innate immune responses of influenza H5N1 virus in human bronchial epithelium may help to understand the pathogenesis. Here we established primary culture of undifferentiated and well differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and infected with highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/3046/2004) and a seasonal influenza H1N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/54/1998), the viral replication kinetics and cytokine and chemokine responses were compared by qPCR and ELISA. We found that the in vitro culture of the well differentiated NHBE cells acquired the physiological properties of normal human bronchi tissue which express high level of \u03B12-6-linked sialic acid receptors and human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease, in contrast to the low expression in the non-differentiated NHBE cells. When compared to H1N1 virus, the H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a stronger type I interferon response in the undifferentiated NHBE cells. In contrast, in well differentiated cultures, H5N1 virus replication was less efficient and elicited a lower interferon-beta response in comparison with H1N1 virus. Our data suggest that the differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells has a major influence in cells\u0027 permissiveness to human H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses and the host innate immune responses. The reduced virus replication efficiency partially accounts for the lower interferon-beta responses in influenza H5N1 virus infected well differentiated NHBE cells. Since influenza infection in the bronchial epithelium will lead to tissue damage and associate with the epithelium regeneration, the data generated from the undifferentiated NHBE cultures may also be relevant to disease pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Renee W.

Objectives To separate the effects of RSV LRTI and an atopic diathesis on subsequent recurrent wheezing, we examined the protective effect of previous palivizumab administration against subsequent recurrent wheeze in infants with and without a family history of atopy. Methods A prospective multicenter, matched, double cohort study was conducted in 27 centers in Europe and Canada. The rates of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in premature infants \u003C36 weeks gestation who had received palivizumab in the first year of life were compared to those of gestational age\u2013matched controls. Results The relative protective effect of palivizumab on physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing through the ages of 2 to 5 years was 68% in those with no family history of asthma (odds ratio, 0.32; (95% CI, 0.14-0.75; N = 146 palivizumab-treated, 171 untreated) and 80% in those with no family history of atopy or food allergies (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59; N = 101 palivizumab-treated, 100 untreated). In contrast, there was no effect of palivizumab on subsequent recurrent wheezing in the 90 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies compared to 130 untreated infants with atopic families. Conclusion Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in nonatopic children decreases by 80% the relative risk of recurrent wheezing but does not have any effect in infants with an atopic family history.

This retrospective study examined the fecal tests records from 1111 dogs and 203 cats with diarrhea submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in the city of Medellin between January and May 2018. The detection of parasites was carried out by direct smears and simple flotation methods. Parasitic organisms were detected in feces from 464 (41.7%) dogs and 96 (47.3%) cats. In order of decreasing prevalence, the parasites detected in dogs were: Giardia intestinalis (13%), ancylostomids (12.6%), Entamoeba spp. (6.1%), coccidian oocysts (5.8%), Toxocara spp. (5.6%) and Dipylidium caninum (1.3%). In cats, the prevalence was: Giardia intestinalis (20%), coccidian oocysts (8.9%), Entamoeba spp. (7.9%), ancylostomids (6.4%), Toxocara spp. (2.5%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%). Age, but not gender, was a predisposing factor, as puppies and kittens had significantly higher infection rates that older age categories. The majority of Giardia intestinalis positive cases occurred in puppies (109/145, 75.2%) and kittens (19/36, 52.8%), making this parasite the most prevalent in amongst animals with diarrhea. Out of 117 positive infections in the adult dog population, ancylostomids accounted for 56 cases (47.9%) and was the most common parasite in this age group. In conclusion, although these results do not imply a cause and effect relationship, they are an estimate of the type of parasites that may be most commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs and cats. The lower diagnostic sensitivity of the traditional methods used here as compared to more contemporary techniques like fecal flotation with centrifugation and PCR, may have underestimated the actual prevalence and diminished the detection of co-infections. Future studies should aim to have diagnostic panels that also screen for other enteric pathogens, including bacterial and viral agents.","publish_time":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Arias, \u00C1nderson; Villar, David; L\u00F3pez-Osorio, Sara; Calle-V\u00E9lez, Daniela; Chaparro-Guti\u00E9rrez, Jenny Jovana","journal":"Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af19f14e780e9e8da5b0aab3854749a3608a4192.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104040.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100335; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939018302806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796191/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405939018302806","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Toxocara"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Medellin"],"keyphrases":["dogs","cats","ancylostomids","common cause of diarrhea","actual prevalence","detection of parasites","majority of Giardia intestinalis positive cases","fecal flotation","puppies","diagnostic laboratory","diagnostic panels","positive infections","common parasite","kittens","type of parasites","Parasitic agents","order of decreasing prevalence","age group","coccidian oocysts","Dipylidium caninum","Entamoeba","Toxocara","simple flotation methods","lower diagnostic sensitivity","older age categories","detection of co-infections","traditional methods","viral agents","Parasitic organisms","fecal tests records","higher infection rates","adult dog population","centrifugation","direct smears","enteric pathogens","retrospective study","estimate","PCR","contemporary techniques","control measures","effect relationship","city of Medellin","predisposing factor","animals","Future studies","feces","results","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

First, we identified bat species that need increased sampling effort for pathogen discovery. Our approach highlights pathogen investigation disparities among species within the same genus, such as Rhinolophus and Pteropus. Secondly, comparative analysis using independent contrasts method allowed the identification of likely factors explaining parasite and viral diversity of bats. Our results showed a key role of bat distribution shape, an index of the fragmentation of bat distribution, on parasite diversity, linked to a decrease for both viral and endoparasite species richness.

Recent in vitro studies show that the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses. Both the magnitude and breadth of the IFITM proteins\u0027 in vitro effects suggest that they are critical for intrinsic resistance to such viruses, including influenza viruses. Using a knockout mouse model, we now test this hypothesis directly and find that IFITM3 is essential for defending the host against influenza A virus in vivo. Mice lacking Ifitm3 display fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 \u0027Spanish\u0027 influenza. Similar increased viral replication is seen in vitro, with protection rescued by the re-introduction of Ifitm3. To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalized subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro. Together these data reveal that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in mouse and humans.","publish_time":"2012-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Everitt, Aaron R.; Clare, Simon; Pertel, Thomas; John, Sinu P.; Wash, Rachael S.; Smith, Sarah E.; Chin, Christopher R.; Feeley, Eric M.; Sims, Jennifer S.; Adams, David J.; Wise, Helen M.; Kane, Leanne; Goulding, David A.; Digard, Paul; Anttila, Verneri; Baillie, J.

AIM: To analyze differences among age groups in terms of triggering factors and seasonality and to identify those with higher risk of severe exacerbations. METHODS: We retrospectively revised the files of children admitted for acute asthma in 2016 in our Pediatric ED. RESULTS: Visits for acute asthma were 603/23197 (2.6%). 76% of the patients were \u003C6 years old and 24% \u22656. Infections were the main trigger of exacerbations in both groups; 33% of the school-aged children had a triggering allergic condition (versus 3% in \u003C6 years; p \u003C .01). 191 patients had a previous history of asthma; among them, 95 were \u22656 years, 67% of whom were not using any controller medication, showing a higher risk of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than those under long-term therapy (p \u003C .01).

To better understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates, in this study, the complete spike (S) and ORF3 genes of 17 PEDV variants in Zhejiang, China during 2014 to 2017, were characterized and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene and ORF3 gene of these 17 novel PEDV strains and PEDV reference strains indicated that all the PEDV strains fell into two groups designated G1 and G2. Notably, the strains identified in 2014\u20132015 were in G2, while the other five strains identified from 2016 to 2017 were in G1. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed that recently prevalent Chinese PEDV field strains shared higher identities with United States strains than with South Korean strains. Compared with classical vaccine strains, a series of deletions and frequently occurring mutations were observed in the receptor binding domains of our PEDV strains. Besides, we successfully isolated and reported the genetic characterization two novel PEDV strains, PEDV-LA1 and PEDV-LY4-98, found on the Chinese mainland, which had significant variations in the S gene. Meanwhile, the virulence of the new mutants may be changed, the PEDV-LY4-98 strain, which has multiple mutations in the signal peptide-encoding fragment of the S gene showed delayed cytopathic effects and smaller plaque size compared with strain PEDV-LA1, which lacks these mutations. Three unique amino acid substitutions (L7, G8, and V9) were identified in the SP-encoding fragment of the S1 N-terminal domain of the PEDV-LY4-98 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the previous PEDV strains. The animal experiment revealed that these two novel strains were high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Whether these amino acids substitutions and the N-glycosylation site substitutions influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of PEDV remains to be investigated. Meanwhile, amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes may have conferred the capacity for immune evasion in these PEDV field strains. This study improves our understanding of ongoing PEDV outbreaks in China, and it will guide further efforts to develop effective measures to control this virus.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Jing; Li, Qunjing; Shao, Chunyan; Ma, Yuanmei; He, Haijian; Jiang, Sheng; Zhou, Yingshan; Wu, Yuan; Ba, Shaobo; Shi, Lin; Fang, Weihuan; Wang, Xiaodu; Song, Houhui","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9055c4e8d4511d973e2246580fc1184557946012.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117340.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.05.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518300075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518300075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","G1"],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["novel PEDV strains","PEDV reference strains","previous PEDV strains","PEDV-LY4","PEDV variants","pathogenicity of PEDV","novel strains","prevalent Chinese PEDV field strains","strain PEDV-LA1","United States strains","South Korean strains","classical vaccine strains","understanding of ongoing PEDV outbreaks","genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates","S gene","S proteins","amino acids substitutions","unique amino acid substitutions","N-glycosylation site substitutions","fragment","study","China","multiple mutations","G1","G2","ORF3 genes","genetic characterization","significant variations","Chinese mainland","phylogenetic analyses","Phylogenetic analysis","significant economic losses","S1 N-terminal domain","higher identities","smaller plaque size","delayed cytopathic effects","L7","growing concerns","capacity","G8","neutralizing epitopes","antigenicity","immune evasion","pig-breeding industry","receptor binding domains","signal peptide","neonatal pigs","complete spike","series of deletions","molecular epidemiology","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea","Zhejiang","groups","effective measures","V9","new mutants","animal experiment","virulence","efforts","virus","Sequencing"],"language":"en"},

How far these aerosols spread and what level of contamination they cause in the dental surgery has become a growing concern as the number of patients with oro-nasal meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization has increased. The present study aimed to determine how far airborne bacteria spread during dental treatment, and the level of contamination. Fall out samples were collected on blood agar plates placed in six different sectors, 0.5\u20132m from the patient. Restorative dentistry fallout samples (N =72) were collected from rooms (N =6) where high-speed rotating instruments were used, and control samples (N =24) were collected from rooms (N =4) used for periodontal and orthodontic treatment where rotating and ultrasonic instruments were not used. The collection times were 1.5 and 3h. In addition, samples were taken from facial masks of personnel and from surfaces in the rooms before and after disinfection. After 48h of incubation at 37\u00B0C, colonies were counted and classified by Gram stain. The results showed significant contamination of the room at all distances sampled when high-speed instruments were used (mean 970 colony-forming units/m2/h). The bacterial density was found to be higher in the more remote sampling points. Gram-positive cocci, namely viridans streptococci and staphylococci, were the most common findings. The area that becomes contaminated during dental procedures is far larger than previously thought and practically encompasses the whole room. These results emphasize the need for developing new means for preventing microbial aerosols in dentistry and protection of all items stored temporarily on work surfaces. This is especially important when treating generally ill or immunocompromised patients at dental surgeries in hospital environments.","publish_time":"2006-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rautemaa, R.; Nordberg, A.; Wuolijoki-Saaristo, K.; Meurman, J.

Therefore, using a participatory action approach, nursing leaders from six sub-Saharan African countries collaborated to develop the essential nursing competencies related to HIV and AIDS.

Most calves experienced an increase in the specific IgM and IgG1 titres about 6\u201310 days after infection with BRSV. The IgM titre was transient showing positive titres for only 5\u201310 days, while specific IgG1 was present for a longer time. IgA was detected concomitantly with IgM but at a lower level. Production of IgG2 anti-BRSV antibodies was detected from 3 weeks after infection. In two closed herds, repeated blood samplings were performed on young stock to analyse maternal immunity. The passively transferred antibodies were mainly of the IgG1 isotype and the half-life of IgG1 to BRSV was estimated to be 26.6 days. One of the herds had an outbreak of enzootic pneumonia, diagnosed to be caused by BRSV. Furthermore, another herd with acute BRSV was followed by weekly blood samples in six calves; in both herds IgM and IgG1 was detected shortly after the appearance of clinical signs. Serum samples from 50 Danish dairy herds (453 samples) were tested for immunoglobulins of the isotypes IgG1, IgG2 and IgM. The presence of antibodies to BRSV was widespread and more than 54% of the samples had BRSV antibodies of both the IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes indicating a high herd prevalence to BRSV. Test samples from two herds out of 50 were free from all isotypes to BRSV.","publish_time":"2000-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uttenthal, \u00C5se; Larsen, Lars Erik; Philipsen, Jens Stege; Tj\u00F8rneh\u00F8j, Kirsten; Viuff, Birgitte; Nielsen, Knud Herby; Nielsen, Thomas Krogh","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dec3bae21563da31f703012a5a4920e0e854ae4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117174.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113500002613; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113500002613","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute BRSV","isotypes IgG1","specific IgG1","herds IgM","experimental BRSV infection","IgG1 titres","IgG1 isotype","half-life of IgG1","specific IgM","Production of IgG2 anti-BRSV antibodies","IgG2 isotypes","closed herds","calves","IgM titre","Serum samples","Test samples","days","weekly blood samples","different isotypes","presence of antibodies","transferred antibodies","Danish dairy herds","specific ELISAs","positive titres","repeated blood samplings","high herd prevalence","antibody levels","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","young stock","Abstract","increase","immunoglobulins","longer time","maternal immunity","outbreak of enzootic pneumonia","weeks","appearance of clinical signs","lower level","IgA"],"language":"en"},

In the recent past many infectious diseases of emerging and re-emerging nature have entered this subcontinent and affected a large number of populations. A few examples are Nipah, Avian influenza, Pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus and Chikungunya virus. These diseases have not only affected human and animal health but also economy of the country on a very large scale. During December 2010, National Institute of Virology, Pune detected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus specific IgG antibodies in livestock serum samples from Gujarat and Rajasthan states. Subsequently, during January 2011 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus was confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak, in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India. Retrospective investigation of suspected human samples confirmed that the virus was present in Gujarat state, earlier to this outbreak. This disease has a case fatality rate ranging from 5 to 80 %. Earlier presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies have been detected in animal sera from Jammu and Kashmir, the western border districts, southern regions and Maharashtra state of India. The evidences of virus activity and antibodies were observed during and after the outbreak in human beings, ticks and domestic animals (buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep) from Gujarat State of India. During the year 2012, this virus was again reported in human beings and animals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the four isolates of 2011, as well as the S segment from specimen of 2010 and 2012 were highly conserved and clustered together in the Asian/Middle East genotype IV. The S segment of South-Asia 2 type was closest to a Tajikistan strain TADJ/HU8966 of 1990. The present scenario in India suggests the need to look seriously into various important aspects of this zoonotic disease, which includes diagnosis, intervention, patient management, control of laboratory acquired and nosocomial infection, tick control, livestock survey and this, should be done in priority before it further spreads to other states. Being a high risk group pathogen, diagnosis is a major concern in India where only a few Biosafety level 3 laboratories exist and it needs to be addressed immediately before this disease becomes endemic in India.","publish_time":"2013-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yadav, Pragya D.; Raut, Chandrashekhar G.; Patil, Deepak Y.; D Majumdar, Triparna; Mourya, Devendra T.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci India Sect B Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbcf2cb3e6aeb73c83f874aa2acc888d2938b1bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100343.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226205/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40011-013-0197-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institute of Virology"],"locations":["India","Rajasthan","Ahmadabad","Gujarat","Jammu","Maharashtra","Asian/Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Gujarat State of India","Chikungunya virus","Maharashtra state of India","evidences of virus activity","human beings","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus specific IgG antibodies","nosocomial outbreak","emerging infectious diseases","infectious diseases of emerging","severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus","diagnosis","zoonotic disease","Retrospective investigation of suspected human samples","livestock serum samples","S segment of South","Earlier presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies","Pandemic influenza","Avian influenza","livestock survey","nosocomial infection","control of laboratory","tick control","domestic animals","animal sera","animal health","Rajasthan states","present scenario","large scale","large number of populations","southern regions","Pune","western border districts","Kashmir","buffalo","goat","ticks","sheep","Jammu","cattle","Asia","patient management","Nipah","need","major concern","re-emerging nature","intervention","hot spot","high risk group pathogen","Tajikistan strain TADJ","various important aspects","Middle East genotype IV","country","subcontinent","National Institute of Virology","economy","Ahmadabad","Biosafety level","HU8966","examples","case fatality rate","laboratories","spreads","specimen","Phylogenetic analysis","isolates","priority","year"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we will review the accumulating evidence detailing the immune biology of IFNL during viral infection, and the implications of this novel information on means to advance the development of therapies and vaccines against existing and emerging pathogens. IFNLs exert antiviral effects via induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNL3, IFNL4 and the IFNL receptor \u03B1-subunit genes have been strongly associated with IFN-\u03B1-based treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The clinical impact of these SNPs may be dependent on the status of viral infection (acute or chronic) and the potential to develop viral resistance. Another important function of IFNLs is macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, which prime helper T-cell activation and proliferation. It has been demonstrated that IFNL increase Th1- and reduce Th2-cytokines. Therefore, can such SNPs affect the IFNL signaling and thereby modulate the Th1/Th2 balance during infection? In turn, this may influence the subsequent priming of cytotoxic T cells versus antibody-secreting B cells, with implications for the breadth and durability of the host response.","publish_time":"2014-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Egli, Adrian; Santer, Deanna M; O\u0027Shea, Daire; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Houghton, Michael","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d887a0239eb93e1f9eed94d50126ba28157c4675.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4126180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038748/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2014.51","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFNL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SNPs","status of viral infection","IFN-\u03B1","immune biology of IFNL","IFNL receptor \u03B1-subunit genes","induction of IFN","implications","IFN-\u03BB","viral resistance","Th1","Th2-cytokines","family of innate cytokines","based treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection","stimulated genes","host response","Th2 balance","family of IFNs","prime helper T-cell activation","subsequent priming of cytotoxic T cells","dendritic cell polarization","important function of IFNLs","antibody-secreting B cells","macrophage","pivotal roles","vaccines","breadth","IFNL3","IFNL4","antiviral effects","Common single nucleotide polymorphisms","development of therapies","pathogen interactions","durability","proliferation","potential","interferons","emerging pathogens","accumulating evidence","novel information","clinical impact","Type","turn"],"language":"en"},

It is a critical resource for the food industry with wide uses. In most of the food preparation and processing operations, water is often taken for granted. Water is very commonly used in food production at various levels, apart from being used as an ingredient. Water quality and its impact on food products and various operations in food industries are often underestimated. Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of revenue, food safety, and product quality. This chapter deals with several aspects of water as applicable to the food production. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, requiring over 100 times more than that used for personal needs. The concept of water footprint is used to discern the importance of relative value in terms of water. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of a wisely chosen crop product with equivalent nutritional value. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water than for cereals and vegetables or fruits. Water is indispensible in cleaning and sanitization in food production, which is an integral part in processing operations in food production. In food storage and preservation, water plays a key role. The water activity of food helps a great deal in deciding shelf-life and food safety. The quality of water is the fundamental consideration in any food production process. The quality depends on the source of water and the actual application in food production. The pollution of water occurs at any stage in various ways. Physical, chemical, or biological agents cause significant health hazards in safe production of food. Contamination of water by several pathological microorganisms creates major challenges in food safety and threats to human and animal health. The majority of diseases which are transmitted through contaminated fresh water, are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Whenever water is used as an ingredient in food product, it must be free from undesirable taste, odor, color, and impurities, including pathogenic organisms that could jeopardize consumers\u2019 health and gravely affect product quality. The quality of water must adhere to the safe drinking water standard. Various techniques and methods of water treatments should be used to purify water as per the guidelines of government authorities to improve food safety. Soil has multiple roles in deciding water quality. Good quality soil has better ability to remove all types of contaminants of water, whereas deteriorated soil becomes a source of heavy metals, organic chemicals, and soil pathogens in water contamination. Use of genetically modified food is gaining much publicity recently. Even though a controversial topic, great care must be taken when genetically modified food is used. It is mandatory that one should review the basic principles of food safety before consuming any food.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhagwat, Vinod R.","journal":"Food Safety and Human Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30fb77bb67dd41ee831fc9ed1cffc80e5c41761b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150035.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128163337000096; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128163337000096","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Water quality","quality of water","water activity of food","source of water","Contamination of water","water contamination","mismanagement of water","terms of water","aspects of water","Abstract Water","pollution of water","safety of food production","modified food","food products","food industry","food industries","food preparation","food storage","safe production of food","food production process","concept of water footprint","methods of water treatments","contaminated fresh water","largest consumer of water","safe drinking water standard","basic principles of food safety","product quality","production of meat","Good quality soil","animal product","various operations","crop product","deteriorated soil","soil pathogens","animal health","processing operations","Various techniques","various levels","various ways","fundamental role","consumers\u2019 health","pathogenic microorganisms","times","ingredient","significant health hazards","fundamental consideration","major challenges","pathological microorganisms","great deal","great care","pathogenic organisms","key role","source of heavy metals","equivalent nutritional value","importance of relative value","threats","biological agents","organic chemicals","maintenance issues","loss of revenue","equipment operation","impact","better ability","odor","color","shelf-life","preservation","cleaning","sanitization","actual application","types of contaminants","guidelines of government authorities","undesirable taste","impurities","cereals","stage","multiple roles","critical resource","wide uses","controversial topic","vegetables","Agriculture","majority of diseases","fruits","chapter","underestimation","publicity","personal needs"],"language":"en"},

In pathology, present study mainly focused on the immune mechanism, but very few studies have concerned with the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DVH. To study the antioxidative and hepatoprotective effects of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative against DVH, we prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin) using the sodium trimetaphosphate\u2013sodium tripolyphosphate method. Ducklings were drunk with icariin and p-icariin after being challenged with duck hepatitis virus 1 (DHV-1). We recorded the number of dead ducklings, gross pathological changes in the liver, and changes in indices of oxidative stress and liver injury. The correlations between these indices were also analyzed. RESULTS: Exposure to DHV-1 induced significant oxidative damage in ducklings. Administration of icariin or p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury and significantly increased the survival rate, with better outcomes in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated with icariin. Icariin and p-icariin also attenuated the changes in oxidative stress and liver injury. We found positive correlations among indices of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and liver injury (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase), suggesting that DHV-1 causes significant oxidative damage, which is related to the extent of hepatic injury. CONCLUSIONS: Icariin and p-icariin improved the survival and attenuated oxidative stress and liver dysfunction induced by DHV-1.

We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in number of new stroke diagnoses in our region, and evaluate the proximate reasons for this change during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center in New Jersey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort was retrospectively analyzed for the number of stroke admissions, demographic features, and short-term outcomes 5 months prior to 3/1/2020 (pre-COVID-19), and in the 6 weeks that followed (COVID-19 period). The primary outcome was the number of new acute stroke diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 period, as well as the potential reasons for a decline in the number of new diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p\u003C0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p\u003C0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p\u003C0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09). There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The observations at our tertiary care corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siegler, J.E.; Heslin, M.E.; Thau, L.; Smith, A.; Jovin, T.G.","journal":"J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0af64e988f6196f001abaaa01a9dbfd910d638a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221408.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410808/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S105230572030361X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105230572030361X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Comprehensive Stroke Center"],"locations":["New Jersey"],"keyphrases":["number of new stroke diagnoses","number of new diagnoses","number of new acute stroke diagnoses","number of stroke admissions","New Jersey","fewer patients","falling rate of new ischemic stroke diagnoses","period","proportion of new LVOs","included patients","pre-COVID","number of daily transfers","monthly number of strokes","smaller proportion of patients","Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort","tertiary care center","anecdotal reports","multi-center studies","significant change","decline","day","SD","exploratory single-center analysis","fewer telestroke consultations","healthcare services","emergency services","proximate reasons","potential reasons","mean fall","high rate of cerebrovascular complications","demographic features","preliminary data warrant validation","SARS-CoV","large vessel occlusion","infection","referral centers","institution","METHODS","pandemic","region","short-term outcomes","months","observations","milder symptoms","primary outcome","evidence","private vehicle","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are proteases that remove ubiquitin modifications or cleave ubiquitin chains. Most DUBs are cysteine proteases, which makes them well suited for study by activity\u2010based probes. These DUB probes report on deubiquitinase activity by reacting covalently with the active site in an enzyme\u2010catalyzed manner. They have proven to be important tools to study DUB selectivity and proteolytic activity in different settings, to identify novel DUBs, and to characterize deubiquitinase inhibitors. Inspired by the efficacy of activity\u2010based probes for DUBs, several groups have recently reported probes for the ubiquitin conjugation machinery (E1, E2, and E3 enzymes). Many of these enzymes, while not proteases, also posses active site cysteine residues and can be targeted by covalent probes. In this review, we will discuss how features of the probe (cysteine\u2010reactive group, recognition element, and reporter tag) affect reactivity and suitability for certain experimental applications. We will also review the diverse applications of the current probes, and discuss the need for new probe types to study emerging aspects of ubiquitin biology.","publish_time":"2017-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hewings, David S.; Flygare, John A.; Bogyo, Matthew; Wertz, Ingrid E.","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40962e5e4a85deed6ddff9a1890545c531852228.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163952.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.14039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28196299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["based probes","ubiquitin modifications","ubiquitin chains","reported probes","current probes","covalent probes","cysteine proteases","deubiquitinase activity","DUB probes report","study","ubiquitin conjugation machinery","proteolytic activity","efficacy of activity","novel DUBs","emerging aspects of ubiquitin biology","review","posses active site cysteine residues","DUB selectivity","diverse applications","deubiquitinase inhibitors","E3 enzymes","new probe types","certain experimental applications","reversible post\u2010translational modification of proteins","different settings","reactivity","suitability","recognition element","E1","E2","protein degradation","reporter tag","reactive group","need","groups","localization","cellular processes","complex formation","important tools","catalyzed manner","features","Deubiquitinases"],"language":"en"},

Despite recent progress in analysing and modelling EBOV epidemiological data, a complete characterization of the spatio-temporal spread of Ebola cases remains a challenge. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the EBOV epidemic in Sierra Leone that uses individual virus genome sequences to inform population-level, spatial models. Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages of virus genomes, these spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV in Sierra Leone without the need for human mobility data. Consistent with other investigations, our results show that the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the epidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our phylodynamic analysis also revealed a change in model preference towards a spatial model with power-law characteristics in the latter portion of the epidemic, correlated with the timing of major intervention campaigns. More generally, we believe this framework, pairing molecular diagnostics with a dynamic model selection procedure, has the potential to be a powerful forecasting tool along with offering operationally relevant guidance for surveillance and sampling strategies during an epidemic.","publish_time":"2017-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gustafson, Kyle B.; Proctor, Joshua L.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4eb170db0dd666fc669649d0e6b15e513b6598d6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9403349de7bef7b3dfd86c83988cb24ade9a9ec9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5721162.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0583; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07866v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":["Sierra Leone"],"keyphrases":["EBOV epidemic","spread of EBOV","disease mobility of EBOV","spatial models","modelling EBOV epidemiological data","Sierra Leone","model preference","recent West African outbreak of Ebola virus","human mobility data","individual virus genome sequences","dynamic model selection procedure","phylogenetic linkages of virus genomes","recent progress","spatio-temporal spread of Ebola cases","complete characterization","potential","population-level","analysing","unique insight","need","relevant guidance","molecular diagnostics","surveillance","sampling strategies","change","power-law characteristics","beginning","novel perspective","powerful forecasting tool","results","middle portions","deployment of substantial global resources","timing of major intervention campaigns","size","challenge","phylodynamic analysis","distance","populations","investigations","framework"],"language":"en"},

We investigated changes in the prescription of psychotropic medications in the Danwon district of Ansan city (Ansan Danwon) compared to a control community before and after the Sewol Ferry disaster on April 16, 2014. Methods Data was collected from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. We analyzed the prescription rates of psychotropic medications including antidepressants, anxiolytics, and sedatives/hypnotics, and investigated whether the time-series pattern of monthly prescriptions per 100,000 people was different in Ansan Danwon compared to that in Cheonan city after the Sewol Ferry disaster through difference-in-differences regression analysis. Results Ansan Danwon showed a significantly greater increase (5.6%) in the prescription rate of antidepressants compared to Cheonan city following the Sewol Ferry disaster. There were no significant differences in changes in the prescription rates of anxiolytics or sedatives/hypnotics. In the secondary analysis, a significantly greater increase in the prescription rate of antipsychotics was observed in Ansan Danwon compared to a control community after the disaster. Limitations We could not exclude the possibility that other events influenced changes in the prescription rates of psychotropic medications during the study period.

Zika envelope domain III (ZE3) has been identified as a safe and effective vaccine candidate, however it is poorly immunogenic. We previously showed that plant-made recombinant immune complex (RIC) vaccines are a robust platform to improve the immunogenicity of weak antigens. In this study, we altered the antigen fusion site on the RIC platform to accommodate N-terminal fusion to the IgG heavy chain (N-RIC), and thus a wider range of antigens, with a resulting 40% improvement in RIC expression over the normal C-terminal fusion (C-RIC). Both types of RICs containing ZE3 were efficiently assembled in plants and purified to \u003E95% homogeneity with a simple one-step purification. Both ZE3 RICs strongly bound complement receptor C1q and elicited strong ZE3-specific antibody titers that correlated with ZIKV neutralization. When either N-RIC or C-RIC was codelivered with plant-produced hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLP) displaying ZE3, the combination elicited 5-fold greater antibody titers (\u003E1,000,000) and more strongly neutralized ZIKV than either RICs or VLPs alone, after only two doses without adjuvant. These findings demonstrate that antigens that require a free N-terminus for optimal antigen display can now be used with the RIC system, and that plant-made RICs and VLPs are highly effective vaccines targeting ZE3. Thus, the RIC platform can be more generally applied to a wider variety of antigens.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diamos, Andrew G.; Pardhe, Mary D.; Sun, Haiyan; Hunter, Joseph G.L.; Mor, Tsafrir; Meador, Lydia; Kilbourne, Jacquelyn; Chen, Qiang; Mason, Hugh S.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fc0f041190515780cb40d25a061fe8893b942c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102565.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.02.089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32173095/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20303376; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20303376","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-RIC","C-RIC","RIC platform","RIC expression","ZE3 RICs","RIC system","N-terminal fusion","effective vaccines","types of RICs","elicited strong ZE3-specific antibody titers","wider range of antigens","wider variety of antigens","normal C-terminal fusion","antigen fusion site","free N-terminus","VLPs","robust platform","ZIKV neutralization","neutralized ZIKV","immunogenicity of weak antigens","greater antibody titers","Abstract Zika virus","effective vaccine candidate","optimal antigen display","Zika envelope domain","bound complement receptor C1q","reemergence","IgG heavy chain","risks","HBc","hepatitis B core","recombinant immune complex","fetal development","significant health threat","improvement","combination","particles","homogeneity","simple one-step purification","pregnant women","doses","study","adjuvant","findings","plants"],"language":"en"},

This study was to determine whether the damage was correlated with expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in different organs, especially in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas, and to elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in SARS patients. The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 SARS patients who died, 385 hospitalized SARS patients who survived, and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia. A total of 39 SARS patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment were compared to 39 matched healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period. The pattern of SARS coronavirus receptor-ACE2 proteins in different human organs was also studied. Significant elevations in oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), but not in alanine transaminase were predictors for death. Abundant ACE2 immunostaining was found in lung, kidney, heart, and islets of pancreas, but not in hepatocytes. Twenty of the 39 followed-up patients were diabetic during hospitalization. After 3 years, only two of these patients had diabetes. Compared with their non-SARS siblings, these patients exhibited no significant differences in FPG, postprandial glucose (PPG), and insulin levels. The organ involvements of SARS correlated with organ expression of ACE2. The localization of ACE2 expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that SARS coronavirus enters islets using ACE2 as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Jin-Kui; Lin, Shan-Shan; Ji, Xiu-Juan; Guo, Li-Min","journal":"Acta Diabetol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b3317a36059a322aa1cbde37ad48513be38b6ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088164.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-009-0109-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19333547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized SARS patients","organ involvements of SARS","non-SARS siblings","non-SARS pneumonia","pattern of SARS coronavirus receptor-ACE2 proteins","organ expression of ACE2","localization of ACE2 expression","islets of pancreas","Abundant ACE2 immunostaining","acute diabetes","postprandial glucose","FPG","Multiple organ damage","damages islets","pathogenesis of glucose intolerance","different organs","previous diabetes","fasting plasma glucose","different human organs","Significant elevations","significant differences","endocrine tissues","matched healthy siblings","severe acute respiratory syndrome","lactate dehydrogenase","serum creatinine","creatine kinase MB isoenzyme","oxygen saturation","lung","PPG","survival","angiotensin","steroid treatment","kidney","heart","alanine transaminase","predictors","death","effect of clinical variables","year follow-up period","insulin levels","hospitalization","total","study","hepatocytes","years"],"language":"en"},

However, a leg-amputee has to take a series of training after wearing a limb prosthesis, and the training results determine whether a patient can use the limb prosthesis correctly in her/his daily life. Limb prosthesis vendors thus desire to offer the leg-amputee a complete and well-organized training process, but they often fail to do so owing to the factors such as the limited support of human resource and financial condition of the amputee. This work proposes a prosthesis training system that the amputees can borrow or buy from the limb prosthesis vendors and train themselves at home. Instant feedback messages provided by the prosthesis training system are used to correct their walking postures during the self-training process. An embedded chip is used as a core to establish a body area sensor network for the prosthesis training system. RFID readers and tags are employed to acquire the 3D positioning information of the amputee\u0027s limbs in this work to assist in diagnosing the amputee\u0027s walking problem.

This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis or affinity column- derived antibodies, both are sterilised and pathogen inactivated for substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody. This include for use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available. This would be a small step forward, while we are waiting to produce an effective, validated vaccine and witnessing increasing demands for testing and self-isolation which are the two most effective current strategies. In line with this concept, some methodological aspects of the use of the UVC sterilization of FFP/ cryoprecipitate-depleted FFP or immunoglobulins containing neutralizing antibodies for clinical use against COVID-19 are highlighted. The plasmapheresis procedure is, of course, particularly targeted to male donors, who consist of about 75 % of the COVID-19 population and who are able to undergo multiple double, or even triple plasmapheresis procedures. Moreover, as some of these donors have already been in an induced-hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and DVT, this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of DVT. Repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selected COVID-19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability. The recipients of such a derived FFP-product would benefit from the two to 3 doses of viral inactivated antibodies, which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage. So, this practice would be a double-edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seghatchian, J.; Lanza, F.","journal":"Transfus Apher Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2020.102792; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050220300811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417123/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050220300811?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UVC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical use","recovered COVID","ill COVID","use of citrate","Repeated targeted plasmapheresis","neutralizing antibodies","source of antibodies","plasma exchange of selected COVID","targeted strategy","doses of viral inactivated antibodies","affinity column- derived antibodies","triple plasmapheresis procedures","derived FFP-product","state of hypercoagulability","male donors","small step","recipients","cryoprecipitate-depleted FFP","UVC sterilization of FFP","validated vaccine","preventative measure","untoward clinical effects of DVT","viral antigens","induced-hypercoagulable state","effective current strategies","immunoglobulins","removal of high molecular weight viscous components","increasing demands","anticoagulants","low concentration","testing","populations","Coronavirus disease","thrombosis","patients","self-isolation","therapeutic measures","multiple double","positive individuals","potential risk of infection","present","double-edged sword","suggestions","methodological aspects","substitution therapy","Heroes","benefits","pathogen","early stage","brave volunteers","concept","need of antibody","concise manuscript","line","practice","health","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. Against mixed results, more research should be done on identifying comorbidities associated with mortality in geriatric patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Char","journal":"Mech Ageing Dev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ea38a354ad16d02d167502df6dad911c657a40c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353398/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637420300518?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0047637420300518","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elderly patients","deceased patients","surviving patients","threshold temperature","geriatric patients of different ages","lower maximum temperature of fever","lower baseline body temperature","clinical data of geriatric COVID","risk factors","key mortality risk factor","research","high risk of fatality","present study","different sources","present work","clinical features","minority","total Chinese population","provinces","severe pneumonia","discomfort","single-centre studies","comorbidities","regular basis","dyspnoea","chest pain","public domain","individuals","mixed results","surveillance"],"language":"en"},

It was recognized as a global health hazard. Methods 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded, and ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. Results Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P \u003C0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P \u003C0.05). Conclusions Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19.

Immunohistochemistry expression profiles in normal tissues and cancer tissues and TCGA survival analysis in renal and liver cancer were conducted. ACE2 was highly conserved in different species. In normal tissues, ACE2 expression distributions were organ-specific, mainly in the kidney, male testis and female breast, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. High level of expression in testis, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might not only attack the lungs, but also affect other organs, particularly the testes, thus it may severely damage male sexual development for younger male and lead to infertility in an adult male, if he contracted COVID-19. On the other side, high expression of ACE2 was correlated with increased survival rate in renal and liver cancer, indicating that ACE2 is a prognostic marker in both renal cancer and liver cancers. Thus, the ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and has a potential anti-tumor role in cancer.

During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7\u201310 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered.

Although laparoscopy can theoretically lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, there is no evidence available to confirm this is the case with COVID-19. The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefits of laparoscopic techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open.

Three of the compounds, which also had furan rings, inhibited the cleavage activity of HAV 3Cpro with K ics of 120\u2013240nM. HPLC-based assays revealed that the inhibitors were slowly hydrolyzed by both HAV 3Cpro and SARS 3CLpro, confirming the identity of the expected products.

Modeling studies indicated that the halopyridinyl moiety of the inhibitor fits tightly into the S1-binding pocket, consistent with the lack of tolerance of the inhibitors to modification in this portion of the molecule.

ViReMa initially attempts to align the 5\u2032 end of a read to the reference genome(s) with the Bowtie seed-based alignment. A new read segment is then made by either extracting any unaligned nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of the read or by trimming the first nucleotide from the read. This continues iteratively until all portions of the read are either mapped or trimmed. With multiple reference genomes, it is possible to detect virus-to-host or inter-virus recombination. ViReMa is also capable of detecting insertion and substitution events and multiple recombination junctions within a single read. By mapping the distribution of recombination events in the genome of flock house virus, we demonstrate that this information can be used to discover de novo functional motifs located in conserved regions of the viral genome.","publish_time":"2013-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Routh, Andrew; Johnson, John E.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e141a069b6f6aef31ddf1a2ae592933db0b4a031.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3902915.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24137010/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["read segments","single read","Viral-Recombination","ViReMa","new read segment","multiple recombination junctions","inter-virus recombination","distribution of recombination events","viral genomes","nucleotide-resolution detection of recombination junctions","multiple reference genomes","genome of flock house virus","end","mapping","substitution events","segments of pre-defined lengths","conserved regions","positions","insertion","Mapper","versatile platform","novo functional motifs","host","Bowtie seed-based alignment","generation sequencing data","algorithm","unaligned nucleotides","information","portions"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area\u226550%) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.

Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants. Rhinovirus (n = 67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 39) were the most frequently detected. Co-infection occurred in 48% (n = 45) of the infants. The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs. 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs. 97%). The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p \u003C 0.001). The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score \u226511). It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the nasal swab can be used, though the sensitivity is lower than the aspirate, in particular, for the detection of mild cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.","publish_time":"2010-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meerhoff, T.

The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

METHODOLOGY: Review of the anti\u2010infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP\u2010I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo\u2010pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). RESULTS: Antiseptics with broad\u2010spectrum anti\u2010infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence\u2010base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin\u2010resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large\u2010scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control.","publish_time":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanagalingam, J.; Feliciano, R.; Hah, J.

There are 23 NTDs that have been prioritized by the World Health Organization, which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people, costing these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The NTDs result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. Therefore, new therapeutics for NTDs are desperately needed. METHODS: We describe various high throughput screening and computational approaches that have been performed in recent years. We have collated the molecules identified in these studies and calculated molecular properties. RESULTS: Numerous global repurposing efforts have yielded some promising compounds for various neglected tropical diseases. These compounds when analyzed as one would expect appear drug-like. Several large datasets are also now in the public domain and this enables machine learning models to be constructed that then facilitate the discovery of new molecules for these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: In the space of a few years many groups have either performed experimental or computational repurposing high throughput screens against neglected diseases. These have identified compounds which in many cases are already approved drugs. Such approaches perhaps offer a more efficient way to develop treatments which are generally not a focus for global pharmaceutical companies because of the economics or the lack of a viable market. Other diseases could perhaps benefit from these repurposing approaches.

One striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed emission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration---not a bimodal one---with a correlation between repetition rate and width. Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks, where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars.

This work is concerned with nonparametric, closed-end testing procedures based on differences of empirical distribution functions that are designed to be particularly sensitive to changes in the comtemporary distribution of multivariate time series. The proposed detectors are adaptations of statistics used in a posteriori (offline) change-point testing and involve a weighting allowing to give more importance to recent observations. The resulting sequential change-point detection procedures are carried out by comparing the detectors to threshold functions estimated through resampling such that the probability of false alarm remains approximately constant over the monitoring period. A generic result on the asymptotic validity of such a way of estimating a threshold function is stated. As a corollary, the asymptotic validity of the studied sequential tests based on empirical distribution functions is proven when these are carried out using a dependent multiplier bootstrap for multivariate time series. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the good finite-sample properties of the resulting procedures. The application of the derived sequential tests is illustrated on financial data.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kojadinovic, Ivan; Verdier, Ghislain","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7776ad1e1d15c70b9c8be0566d0b27f6bb600c09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12322v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resulting sequential change","aim of sequential change","resulting procedures","detection procedures","threshold functions","studied sequential tests","derived sequential tests","differences of empirical distribution functions","comtemporary distribution of multivariate time series","asymptotic validity","end testing procedures","monitored observations","proposed detectors","recent observations","certain probabilistic properties","probability of false alarm","good finite-sample properties","Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments","dependent multiplier bootstrap","resampling","adaptations of statistics","posteriori","changes","way","financial data","importance","generic result","application","monitoring period","weighting","corollary","work"],"language":"en"},

The health and economic consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic provide a poignant case. Here we point out that since they are based on differential equations, the most widely used models of epidemic spread are plagued by an approximation that is not justified in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the example of data from New York City, we show that currently used models significantly underestimate the initial basic reproduction number ($R_0$). The correct description, based on integral equations, can be implemented in most of the reported models and it much more accurately accounts for the dynamics of the epidemic after sharp changes in $R_0$ due to restrictive public congregation measures. It also provides a novel way to determine the incubation period, and most importantly, as we demonstrate for several countries, this method allows an accurate monitoring of $R_0$ and thus a fine-tuning of any restrictive measures. Integral equation based models do not only provide the conceptually correct description, they also have more predictive power than differential equation based models, therefore we do not see any reason for using the latter.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fodor, Z.; Katz, S.

As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3$\\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising. Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity of COVID-19, were revealed.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Zhenyu; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Zhong, Zheng; Shi, Feng; Liu, Jun; Shen, Dinggang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9ad10ebac0e5012f278c715ccbc9c87deebe0aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11988v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of COVID","severity-related features","automatic severity assessment","manual severity assessment","RF model","resulting assessment model","lung volume","confirmed COVID","resulting importance of quantitative features","volume of ground","infection volume","chest CT images","right lung","left lung","ground glass opacity","GGO","regions","ratio","promising results","true negative rate","true positive rate","Chest computed tomography","machine learning method","number of affected patients","labor-intensive task","receiver","characteristic curve","area","years","accuracy","female","Background","cross validation","Materials","respect","important tool","correlation","potential","AUC","Purpose","random forest","Conclusion","delayed treatment","performance"],"language":"en"},

Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end, this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld\u0027s largest real-world masked face dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95% accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry.

In this setting, the virus\u0027 basic reproductive number R_0, which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each primary case, takes on a significant importance in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic. Yet, in most models, R_0 is assumed to be a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations -- thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable. Considering its expected value thus leads to biased or loose results in the reported predictive scenarios, especially as these are tailored to a given country or region. The goal of this paper is the examination of the impact of the reproductive number R\u0027s variability on important output metrics, and the percolation of this variability in projected scenarios so as to provide uncertainty quantification. In this perspective, instead of considering a single R_0, we consider a distribution of reproductive numbers R and devise a simple Bayesian hierarchical model that builds upon current methods for estimating the R to integrate its heterogeneity. We then simulate the spread of the epidemic, and the impact of different social distancing strategies using a probabilistic framework that models hospital occupancy. This shows the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results. We emphasize that our goal is not to replace benchmark methods for estimating the basic reproductive numbers, but rather to discuss the importance of the impact of R\u0027s heterogeneity on uncertainty quantification for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donnat, Claire; Holmes, Susan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46e427f7a44ad943d76fb4e922bab5f0475e8268.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05272v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["basic reproductive number R","reproductive number R\u0027s variability","distribution of reproductive numbers R","single R","impact of R\u0027s heterogeneity","basic reproductive numbers","added variability","inherent variability","strong impact","current methods","uncertainty quantification","current COVID","reproduction number","global pandemic","virus","reported results","goal","models","average number of secondary cases","reported predictive scenarios","impact of different social distancing strategies","loose results","projected scenarios","benchmark methods","significant importance","varying population densities","probabilistic framework","important output metrics","transmission process","percolation","simple Bayesian hierarchical model","temporal factors","demographics","primary case","outbreak clusters","leading experts","populations","examination","universal constant","potential scope","risks","hospital occupancy","evolution","epidemic","paper","setting","expected value","given country","region","disease","policies","perspective","spread"],"language":"en"},

In this regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the sequences of actions.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miralles-Pechu\u0027an, Luis; Jim\u0027enez, Fernando; Ponce, Hiram; Mart\u0027inez-Villasenor, Lourdes","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2045c7b4eb7bab2e258c15586796e69e302b9117.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07656v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["right actions","best sequences of actions governments","economy","negative effects","drastic measures","different approaches governments","self-isolation","virus COVID","Deep Q-Learning","methodology","pandemic","future effects","Genetic Algorithms","population","right decisions","relaxed restrictions","optimal approach","serious damage","risk","objectives","SEIR epidemiological model","evolution","meter distance","valid tool","confinement","high percentage","hospitals","reward system","meeting","infectious diseases","time","case","public health","critical patients","people","paper","conducted experiments","order","senses","regard","countries"],"language":"en"},

Huge number of studies tried to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417 and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2.

In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, predictive mathematical models can help exploring of both COVID-19 transmission and control. In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission that incorporate lock-down effect and variability in transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily COVID-19 notified cases from three states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Telangana) and overall India, we assess the effect of current 21 days lock-down in terms of reduction cases and deaths. Lock-down effect is studied with different lock-down success rate. Our result suggest that 21 days lock-down will have no impact in Maharashtra and overall India. Furthermore, the presence of a higher percentage of COVID-19 super-spreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However, for Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that lock-down will reduce a significant number of cases and deaths. in these two locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a comfort zone. Comparing estimated parameter samples for the mentioned four locations, we find a correlation between effect of lockdown and percentage of symptomatic infected in a region. Our result suggests that a higher percentage of symptomatic infected in a region leads to a large number of reduction in notified cases and deaths due to different lock-down scenario.

We studied Calculus II classes for STEM majors using different testing modes. Three sections with 324 students employed: Paper-and-pencil testing, computer-based testing, and both. Computer tests gave immediate feedback, allowed multiple submissions, and pooling. Paper-and-pencil tests required work and explanation allowing inspection of high cognitive demand tasks. Each test mode used the strength of its method. Students were given the same lecture by the same instructor on the same day and the same homework assignments and due dates. The design is quasi-experimental, but students were not aware of the testing mode at registration. Two basic questions examined were: (1) Do paper-and-pencil and computer-based tests measure knowledge and skill in STEM Calculus II in a consistent manner? (2) How does the knowledge and skill gained by students in a fully computer-based Calculus II class compare to students in a class requiring pencil-and-paper tests and hence some paper-and-pencil work. These results indicate that computer-based tests are as consistent with paper-and-pencil tests as computer-based tests are with themselves. Results are also consistent with classes using paper-and-pencil tests having slightly better outcomes than fully computer-based classes using only computer assessments.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smolinsky, Lawrence; Marx, Brian D.; Olafsson, Gestur; Ma, Yanxia A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c5cda001c747ac1a3864b621e6ceeaac154e4f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05462v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Computer tests","pencil tests","paper tests","Computer-based testing","computer-based classes","computer-based Calculus","pencil testing","students","computer-based tests measure knowledge","computer assessments","pencil work","STEM Calculus","different testing modes","skill","consistent manner","results","STEM majors","test mode","explanation","expanding use of technology","inspection of high cognitive demand tasks","better outcomes","advantages","immediate feedback","multiple submissions","teachers","day","homework assignments","strength","design","registration","instructor","dates","pooling","method","lecture","sections","basic questions"],"language":"en"},

We show that humans have always been exposed to nanoparticles and dust from natural sources and human activities, the recent development of industry and combustion-based engine transportation profoundly increasing anthropogenic nanoparticulate pollution. The key to understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles is that their minute size, smaller than cells and cellular organelles, allows them to penetrate these basic biological structures, disrupting their normal function. Among diseases associated with nanoparticles are asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson\u0060s and Alzheimer\u0060s diseases), Crohn\u0060s disease, colon cancer. Nanoparticles that enter the circulatory system are related to occurrence of arteriosclerosis, and blood clots, arrhythmia, heart diseases, and ultimately cardiac death. We show that possible adverse effects of nanoparticles on human health depend on individual factors such as genetics and existing disease, as well as exposure, and nanoparticle chemistry, size, shape, and agglomeration state. The faster we will understand their causes and mechanisms, the more likely we are to find cures for diseases associated with nanoparticle exposure.

During usability testing we discovered that users of the crowdscience game Quantum Dreams tended to answer questions in game terms, even when directed explicitly to give science explanations.We then examined these competing frames of understanding through a mixed correlational and grounded theory analysis.

Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region, followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehsani, Sepehr","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9410aca958ca0a1bb38bae507331a0018309ce6b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12191v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepcidin protein","coronavirus spike protein","viral spike protein","spike glycoprotein","humans","ectodomain","report","coronavirus research field","vaccine potential","cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail","research focus","systemic iron regulation","potential route of investigation","key regulator of iron metabolism","binding capacity","cytokine","interplay of local","evolutionary connection","inflammatory processes","host cell surface receptors","respiratory infections","use","established literature","distant sequence similarity","attention","SARS-CoV","question of possible homology","preliminary observation","transmembrane region","COVID","implication","scenarios","study","vertebrates"],"language":"en"},

Recently it has been noticed that the viral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and cell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates. They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 mu2 subunit as well as I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2 and integrin beta3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit autophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a conserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by beta integrins for ligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2 share common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility that it might be possible to develop host-directed therapies to dampen the efficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence conservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless, SLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to be functional.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u0027esz\u0027aros, B\u0027alint; S\u0027amano-S\u0027anchez, Hugo; Alvarado-Valverde, Jes\u0027us; vCalyvseva, Jelena; Mart\u0027inez-P\u0027erez, Elizabeth; Alves, Renato; Kumar, Manjeet; Rippmann, Friedrich; Chemes, Luc\u0027ia B.; Laboratory, Toby J.

A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Additionally, we define a method that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boetto, Erik; Fantini, Maria Pia; Gangemi, Aldo; Golinelli, Davide; Greco, Manfredi; Nuzzolese, Andrea Giovanni; Presutti, Valentina; Rallo, Flavia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c837018d332088b3b45f0b6189d1df3cb53064d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06179v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Wuhan City"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","impact indicators","COVID","knowledge graph","different indicators","aforementioned indicators","coronavirus disease","literature review","scientific papers","cause","sample","new type of coronavirus","tight time-window","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus","early stages","time-windows","extent altmetrics","use-case","relevant research outcomes","potential impactful research","early scholarly communication","number of scientific works","multi-dimensional impact indicator","traditional citation count","citations","citational acts","cases of pneumonia","social media","China Country Office","unknown etiology","moderate correlation","rigorous eligibility criteria","World Health Organization","common intended meaning","day","data analysis process","Wuhan City","em quasi-","news","frameworkds","method","blogs","toos"],"language":"en"}]}

Here, we investigated the effects of CTSL on SIgA responses and invariant chain (Ii) degradations in the co-cultured swine dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells system in vitro. When the cells system were transfected with vector CTSL-GFP or incubated with recombinant CTSL (rCTSL) before they were infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hp), SIgA significantly increased and Ii chain was degraded into smaller intermediates, while SIgA decreased when CTSL was knockdown or inhibited with E64. To confirm the SIgA responses promoted by CTSL contribute to the resistance to mycoplasma pneumonia, pigs injected with rCTSL before they were challenged with M.hp, showed milder clinical symptoms and histopathological damage of lungs, less mycoplasma burden together with higher secretion of SIgA, percentages of CD4(\u002B) T cells and level of MHC II molecules comparing with the group without rCTSL. Collectively, these results suggested that rCTSL could provide effective protection for piglets against mycoplasma pneumonia by enhancing M.hp-specific mucosal immune responses through its role in antigen presentation by processing the invariant chain.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ning; Gao, Peng; Yin, Bao; Li, Jiahe; Wu, Tong; Kuang, Yu; Wu, Wenxue; Li, Jinxiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd59245a431a62e93a213ec343f168d77dcfc199.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6464228.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mycoplasma"],"organizations":["CTSL","MHC II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIgA responses","recombinant CTSL","effects of CTSL","rCTSL","mycoplasma pneumonia","cellular immune responses","mycoplasma burden","mycoplasma infection","regulatory functions of CTSL","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","vector CTSL-GFP","hp-specific mucosal immune responses","T cells","invariant chain","B cells system","higher secretion of SIgA","co-cultured swine dendritic cells","DCs","histopathological damage of lungs","degradations","role","mice","milder clinical symptoms","effective protection","antigen presentation","percentages of CD4","molecules","piglets","level of MHC","pigs","resistance","smaller intermediates","group","leishmaniasis","results","E64","Cathepsin"],"language":"en"},

With major advances in genetic sequencing and biomedical research, much research into monoclonal antibodies now focuses on identifying new targets for development and maximising their efficacy for use in clinical practice. However, a balance has to be struck with regards to reducing numbers of side-effects and overall economic cost, which arguably somewhat blighted their early clinical and commercial successes.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal episodes in German households with children attending day care and to compare results of prospective and retrospective data collection. METHODS: We conducted a 4 months prospective cohort study in the winter period 2014/2015 and recruited parents of children aged 0\u20136 years in 75 day care centers in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany. For all household members, we collected information on episodes of ARI and AGI. We applied prospective data collection in one study arm and retrospective data collection with a reporting period of 2 months in the other. Poisson regression was used to model monthly incidence rates for both study arms. RESULTS: In total, 100 households (including 404 persons) participated in the retrospective group and 77 households (282 persons) in the prospective group. Incidence estimates for ARI (retrospective group: 0.52 per person month, prospective group: 0.47) were higher than for AGI (retrospective group: 0.14, prospective group: 0.13). The adjusted incidence estimates were similar in both study arms for ARI (incidence rate ratio for retrospective versus prospective data collection: 1.11 [confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.99; 1.24], p = 0.42) as well as for AGI (1.10 [CI 95% 0.89; 1.37], p = 0.27). CONCLUSION: If there is no need to collect biomaterials or data on severity of the diseases, incidence of infections in the household setting over a short time period (2 months) can be assessed retrospectively.

Two routes of mDEF201 administration were used, nasal sinus (5-\u00B5l) and pulmonary (50-\u00B5l), to compare differences in efficacy, since the preferred treatment of humans would be in a relatively small volume delivered intranasally. Lower respiratory infections (LRI), upper respiratory infections (URI), and systemic infections were induced by 50-\u00B5l intranasal, 10-\u00B5l intranasal, and 100-\u00B5l intraperitoneal virus challenges, respectively. mDEF201 treatments were given prophylactically either 24 h (short term) or 56d (long-term) prior to virus challenge. Single nasal sinus treatments of 10(6) and 10(7) PFU/mouse of mDEF201 protected all mice from vaccinia-induced LRI mortality (comparable to published studies with pulmonary delivered mDEF201). Systemic vaccinia infections responded significantly better to nasal sinus delivered mDEF201 than to pulmonary treatments. Cowpox LRI infections responded to 10(7) mDEF201 treatments, but a 10(6) dose was only weakly protective. Cowpox URI infections were equally treatable by nasal sinus and pulmonary delivered mDEF201 at 10(7) PFU/mouse. Dose-responsive prophylaxis with mDEF201, given one time only 56 d prior to initiating a vaccinia virus LRI infection, was 100% protective from 10(5) to 10(7) PFU/mouse. Improvements in lung hemorrhage score and lung weight were evident, as were decreases in liver, lung, and spleen virus titers. Thus, mDEF201 was able to treat different vaccinia and cowpox virus infections using both nasal sinus and pulmonary treatment regimens, supporting its development for humans.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smee, Donald F.; Wong, Min-Hui; Hurst, Brett L.; Ennis, Jane; Turner, Jeffrey D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/235451b60cac00666f0e69e9d196d090da8609a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3706414.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23874722/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse of mDEF201","mDEF201 treatments","pulmonary delivered mDEF201","cowpox virus infections","systemic infections","Systemic vaccinia infections","Cowpox LRI infections","Cowpox URI infections","virus respiratory","pulmonary treatments","upper respiratory infections","vaccinia virus LRI infection","Lower respiratory infections","routes of mDEF201 administration","Single nasal sinus treatments","\u00B5l intranasal","\u00B5l intraperitoneal virus challenges","different vaccinia","vaccinia-induced LRI mortality","PFU","pulmonary treatment regimens","spleen virus titers","lethal cowpox","lung weight","mice","efficacy","mouse interferon alpha","protective","lung hemorrhage score","preferred treatment of humans","WR strain","Brighton strain","Dose-responsive prophylaxis","studies","vector","Improvements","development","subtype","short term","adenovirus","differences","time","small volume"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To determine if the pathogens adenovirus (ADV), coronavirus (CoV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), enterovirus (EV), influenza A-D (IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), and porcine rotaviruses A and C (RVA and RVC), are aerosolized at the animal-interface, and if humans working in these environments are carrying these viruses in their nasal airways. STUDY: This cross-sectional study took place in Sarawak, Malaysia among 11 pig farms, 2 abattoirs, and 3 animal markets in June and July of 2017. Pig feces, pig oral secretions, bioaerosols, and worker nasal wash samples were collected and analyzed via rPCR and rRT-PCR for respiratory and diarrheal viruses. RESULTS: In all, 55 pig fecal, 49 pig oral or water, 45 bioaerosol, and 78 worker nasal wash samples were collected across 16 sites. PCV2 was detected in 21 pig fecal, 43 pig oral or water, 3 bioaerosol, and 4 worker nasal wash samples. In addition, one or more bioaerosol or pig samples were positive for EV, IAV, and RVC, and one or more worker samples were positive for ADV, CoV, IBV, and IDV. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that nucleic acids from a number of targeted viruses were present in pig oral secretions and pig fecal samples, and that several viruses were detected in bioaerosol samples or in the nasal passages of humans with occupational exposure to pigs. These results demonstrate the need for future research in strengthening viral surveillance at the human-animal interface, specifically through expanded bioaerosol sampling efforts and a seroepidemiological study of individuals with exposure to pigs in this region for PCV2 infection.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borkenhagen, Laura K.; Mallinson, Kerry A.; Tsao, Rick W.; Ha, Siaw-Jing; Lim, Wei-Honn; Toh, Teck-Hock; Anderson, Benjamin D.; Fieldhouse, Jane K.; Philo, Sarah E.; Chong, Kuek-Sen; Lindsley, William G.; Ramirez, Alejandro; Lowe, James F.; Coleman, Kristen K.; Gray, Gregory C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9271f0b0a1dc37e0a0fa6edf79da42f98bb87026.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6063427.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052648/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADV","IDV"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["pig samples","pig fecal samples","bioaerosol samples","worker samples","pig farms","Pig feces","pig oral secretions","worker nasal wash samples","diarrheal viruses","emerging viruses","nasal airways","nasal passages of humans","cross-sectional study","animal-interface","number of targeted viruses","human-animal interface","expanded bioaerosol sampling efforts","seroepidemiological study of individuals","pigs","EV","ADV","IBV","IAV","water","animal markets","IDV","PCV2 infection","RVC","RESULTS","occupational exposure","porcine rotaviruses","porcine circovirus","dense human population of Southeast Asia","bioaerosols","large livestock operations","coronavirus","viral surveillance","Sarawak","future research","enterovirus","encephalomyocarditis virus","EMCV","nucleic acids","place","ICV","Malaysia","rRT-PCR","hot-spot","need","RVA","influenza","rPCR","region","abattoirs","pathogens adenovirus","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","environments","sites","OBJECTIVES","addition"],"language":"en"},

The positions of the hosts are randomly generated in a rectangular habitat. Encounters between any pair of individuals are according to a Poisson process with a mean rate that declines exponentially as the distance between them increases. The contact rate allows the mean rates to be set at a certain number of encounters per day on average. The relevant state variables for each individual at any time are given by the solution of a pair of coupled differential equations for the viral load and the quantity of general immune system effectors which reduce the viral load. The parameters describing within-host viral-immune system dynamics are generated randomly to reflect variability across a population. Transmission is assumed to depend on the viral loads in donors and occurs with a probability p trans . The initial conditions are such that one randomly chosen individual carries a randomly chosen amount of the virus, whereas the rest of the population is uninfected. Simulations reveal local or whole-population responses. Whole-population disease spread may be in the form of isolated or multiple occurrences, the latter often being approximately periodic. The mechanisms of this oscillatory behaviour are analyzed in terms of several parameters and the distribution of critical points in the host dynamical systems. Increased contact rate, increased probability of transmission and decreased threshold for viral transmission, decreased immune strength and increased viral growth rate all increase the probability of multiple outbreaks and the distribution of the critical points also plays a role.","publish_time":"2007-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuckwell, Henry C.; Toubiana, Laurent","journal":"Biosystems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115796.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264706002929; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264706002929","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral transmission","viral disease","viral loads","increased viral growth rate","increased probability of transmission","host viral-immune system dynamics","Increased contact rate","population disease spread","population responses","immune strength","distribution of critical points","probability of multiple outbreaks","parameters","probability p trans","quantity of general immune system effectors","decreased threshold","multiple occurrences","mean rates","pair of individuals","distributed hosts","individual carries","host dynamical systems","certain number of encounters","new mathematical model","type models","differential equations","spatio-temporal structure of epidemics","classical SIR","susceptible-infective","day","terms","form of isolated","Poisson process","donors","relevant state variables","oscillatory behaviour","order","time","average","solution","rest","mechanisms","Abstract","role","Simulations","variability","rectangular habitat","initial conditions","virus","positions","distance"],"language":"en"},

This study was designed to assess the beneficial effects of post-treatment of oroxylin A (OroA), a flavonoid, in ameliorating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and fatality. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) to induce ALI, and OroA was given (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. Twenty four hrs after LPS challenge, biochemical changes in the blood and lung tissues, and morphological/histological alterations in the lung associated with inflammation and injury were examined. Therapeutic effect of OroA was assessed by measuring the survival rate in endotoxemic mice. KEY RESULTS: LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) significantly altered WBC counts, elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and nitric oxide (NO), increased pulmonary edema, thickened alveolar septa, and decreased survival rate. These changes were ameliorated by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. This post-treatment also significantly attenuated LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) and the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in lung tissues. Furthermore, post-treatment with OroA (60 mg/kg, ip) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge in mice significantly increased survival rate.

Consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to obtain cDNA, then cloned and sequenced a highly conserved 922 nucleotide region in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the polymerase (pol) gene from eight coronaviruses. These sequences were compared with published sequences for three additional coronaviruses. In this comparison, it was found that nucleotide substitution frequencies (per 100 nucleotides) varied from 46.40 to 50.13 when viruses were compared among the traditional coronavirus groups and, with one exception (the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E), varied from 2.54 to 15.89 when compared within these groups. (The substitution frequency for 229E, as compared to other members of the same group, varied from 35.37 to 35.72.) Phylogenetic analysis of these pol gene sequences resulted in groupings which correspond closely with the previously described groupings, including recent data which places the two avian coronaviruses\u2014infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens and turkey coronavirus (TCV)\u2014in the same group [Guy, J.S., Barnes, H.J., Smith L.G., Breslin, J., 1997.

Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the keyword \u201Cvirome\u201D. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the 2019-nCoV sequence (F. Wu et al. 2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3; P.

(Viruses 11:11, 2019, http://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979). Our observations are relevant to discussions of the derivation of 2019-nCoV and illustrate the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid sequences.

The induction of RNAi relies on small silencing RNAs, which affect specific messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. Two types of small RNA molecules, i.e. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are central to RNAi. Drug discovery studies and novel treatments of siRNAs are currently targeting a wide range of diseases, including various viral infections and cancers. Lung diseases in general are attractive targets for siRNA therapeutics because of their lethality and prevalence. In addition, the lung is anatomically accessible to therapeutic agents via the intrapulmonary route. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs play an important role in lung abnormalities, such as inflammation and oncogenesis. Therefore, miRNAs are being targeted for therapeutic purposes. In this review, we present strategies for RNAi delivery and discuss the current state-of-the-art RNAi-based therapeutics for various lung diseases.","publish_time":"2013-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujita, Yu; Takeshita, Fumitaka; Kuwano, Kazuyoshi; Ochiya, Takahiro","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a11a6e99c61da77f540fa28b3ab843761537711.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3816685.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24275949/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph6020223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various lung diseases","RNAi delivery","induction of RNAi","miRNAs","lung abnormalities","small silencing RNAs","small interfering RNAs","current state-of-the-art RNAi-based therapeutics","types of small RNA molecules","therapeutic agents","development of therapeutic gene silencing","RNA interference","therapeutic purposes","specific messenger RNA","wide range of diseases","siRNA therapeutics","important role","important method","gene functions","novel treatments of siRNAs","various viral infections","attractive targets","general","microRNAs","Drug discovery studies","lethality","mRNA","degradation","present strategies","intrapulmonary route","eukaryotes","cancers","prevalence","inflammation","review","oncogenesis","addition"],"language":"en"},

Aim: To evaluate the association between IgE sensitization and viral infection in wheezing children. Methods: This is an observational study in hospitalized wheezing children (n = 247; median age 1.6 ; interquartile range 1.1, 2.9). Eighteen respiratory viral infections were studied using all available methods. A specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization for common food and aeroallergens and other atopy\u2010related variables including total IgE, blood and nasal eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, eczema and atopic eczema, parental allergy and asthma, number of wheezing episodes, positive asthma predictive index or asthma and use of inhaled corticosteroid were correlated with specific viral etiology. Results: Atopy was closely associated with sole rhinovirus etiology (n = 58) but not with sole respiratory syncytial virus, sole enterovirus, sole human bocavirus, sole other virus, mixed viral, or virus negative etiology. The number of sensitizations was particularly associated with sole rhinovirus etiology (odds ratio 4.59; 95% confidence interval 1.78, 11.8; adjusted to age and sex), followed by aeroallergen sensitization (respectively; 4.18; 2.00, 8.72), total IgE level (2.06; 1.32, 3.21), food allergen sensitization (2.02; 1.08, 3.78), and nasal eosinophil count (1.52; 1.08, 2.13). Conclusions: According to our data, allergic sensitization is positively linked to rhinovirus\u2010, but not other virus\u2010, associated wheezing and calls attention for studies to test rhinovirus\u2010associated wheezing as a part of asthma risk indices.","publish_time":"2010-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jartti, T.; Kuusipalo, H.; Vuorinen, T.; S\u00F6derlund\u2010Venermo, M.; Allander, T.; Waris, M.; Hartiala, J.; Ruuskanen, O.","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34d76251fabe1274619a0c8a7b7ac818d4353e64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168081.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2010.01059.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20977499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Jartti T, Kuusipalo H, Vuorinen T","IgE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated wheezing","sole rhinovirus etiology","IgE sensitization","Allergic sensitization","specific viral etiology","sole enterovirus","sole respiratory syncytial virus","induced wheezing","aeroallergen sensitization","hospitalized wheezing children","virus negative etiology","number of wheezing episodes","atopy","viral wheeze","food allergen sensitization","sole human bocavirus","respiratory viral infections","total IgE level","Vuorinen T","Allander T","Jartti T","asthma risk indices","Data","positive asthma predictive index","atopic eczema","nasal eosinophils","parental allergy","common food","median age","number of sensitizations","available methods","specific immunoglobulin E","Pediatr Allergy Immunol","nasal eosinophil count","S\u00F6derlund","blood","studies","nitric oxide","Hartiala J","Waris","Kuusipalo H","Venermo","related variables","link","aeroallergens","S Background","observational study","odds ratio","calls attention","Sons","Ruuskanen","inhaled corticosteroid","association","John Wiley","confidence interval","interquartile range","sex","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

Hotel performance measures are revenue (revenue per available room and occupancy rate), profitability (return on assets and return on equity) and stock performance. The crises were the earthquake on September 21, 1999 (the 9/21 earthquake), the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the US (the 9/11 terrorist attacks) and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on April 22, 2003 (the SARS outbreak). This study makes four major contributions. First, test results confirm that international tourism development (ITD), proxied by the growth of total inbound tourist arrivals, has a more direct influence on hotel sales and profitability than it does on hotel stock performance. Second, this study identifies that the absence of a strong tie between ITD and hotel stock returns that was found in previous studies is due to the time-varying discount rate caused by investors\u2019 changing expectations for the prospect of future cash flows from holding hotel stocks. Third, this study finds new evidence that while the poor performance of hotel stocks caused by the 9/21 earthquake and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was attributed to the loss of hotel sales revenue, the adverse effect of the SARS outbreak on hotel stock returns is attributed not only to decreased hotel sales revenue but also to the increased discount rate. Lastly, this study is the first to investigate whether the response of hotel stock returns to ITD depends on the state of economy and concludes that the response of hotel stock performance to ITD in business cycle contraction is statistically different from that in business cycle expansion. Further, although the influence of ITD on hotel stock performance is still irrelevant during expansion periods, ITD can significantly enhance hotel stock returns during contraction periods.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ming-Hsiang","journal":"International Journal of Hospitality Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/499a22b77b22d909cf7aede4965dde1227b4aa69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115807.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431910000782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287854/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431910000782; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2010.06.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ITD"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["response of hotel performance","response of hotel stock performance","Hotel performance measures","response of hotel stock returns","poor performance of hotel stocks","loss of hotel sales revenue","study","influence of ITD","terrorist attacks","earthquake","SARS outbreak","international tourism development","profitability","occupancy rate","business cycle contraction","business cycle expansion","contraction periods","increased discount rate","expansion periods","time-varying discount rate","direct influence","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","adverse effect","expectations","available room","prospect of future cash flows","crisis events","strong tie","investors\u2019","growth of total inbound tourist arrivals","panel regression tests","Taiwan","test results","absence","new evidence","equity","previous studies","assets","state of economy","major contributions","crises"],"language":"en"},

In response, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics remains a clinical priority. To accomplish this, it is necessary to evaluate neutralizing antibodies and screen for MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. METHODS: In this study, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV in the Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 backbone. We then established a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay to detect neutralizing antibodies and anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the generated MERS-CoV pseudovirus allows for single-cycle infection of a variety of cells expressing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the confirmed receptor for MERS-CoV. Consistent with the results from a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay, the antisera of mice vaccinated with a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 377\u2013662) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG exhibited neutralizing antibody response against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Furthermore, one small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) and the 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the established MERS-CoV inhibition assay is a safe and convenient pseudovirus-based alternative to BSL-3 live-virus restrictions and can be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors, as well as evaluate vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Guangyu; Du, Lanying; Ma, Cuiqing; Li, Ye; Li, Lin; Poon, Vincent KM; Wang, Lili; Yu, Fei; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14c6dff031b3bcf8a7ea8486965b1dd888cf46a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765664.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23978242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["live MERS-CoV","pathogenic MERS-CoV","MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection","generated MERS-CoV pseudovirus","infection of MERS","protein of MERS","MERS-CoV S fused","established MERS-CoV inhibition assay","anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors","pseudovirus-based inhibition assay","neutralizing antibodies","RESULTS","convenient pseudovirus-based alternative","neutralizing antibody response","novel human coronavirus","screen","small molecule HIV entry inhibitor","Fc of human IgG","human serum albumin","single-cycle infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","recombinant protein","confirmed receptor","receptor-binding domain","live-virus restrictions","gp41","BSL","variety of cells","therapeutics","development of effective vaccines","SARS","emergence","antisera of mice","ADS-J1","hydroxyphthalic anhydride","HP-HSA","full-length spike","dipeptidyl peptidase","luciferase","DPP4","RBD","residues","Env-defective","clinical priority","BACKGROUND","Evidence","backbone","disease","study","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU\u2019s immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs.","publish_time":"2019-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scholte, Florine E.

Immunohistochemical testing of biopsy specimens and postmortem examination are the standard diagnostic methods, although direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing to detect feline coronavirus in macrophages in effusion specimens has been reported to have 100% specificity and has been recommended as an antemortem confirmatory test. The aim of this study was to compare the results of DIF testing in antemortem feline effusions with postmortem results using field samples. Effusion specimens were collected antemortem from 17 cats and tested by DIF, followed by postmortem examination. Histopathological examination of specimens collected at postmortem confirmed FIP in 10/17 cases and ruled out FIP out in 7/17 cases. Antemortem DIF testing was positive in all 10 cases confirmed as FIP at postmortem examination. In the seven cats where FIP was ruled out at postmortem examination, DIF was negative in five cases and positive in the remaining two cases. The calculated sensitivity of DIF testing was 100% and the specificity was 71.4%. Duplicate effusion specimens from eight cats that were initially DIF positive were stored refrigerated (4\u00B0C) or at room temperature (22\u201325\u00B0C) and subjected to serial DIF testing to determine the duration of positive results.

The concept is based on the continuous emission of unipolar ions. The effect was evaluated through the real-time monitoring of the concentration and size distribution of fine and ultrafine aerosol particles. The measurements were conducted inside and outside of a respiratory mask that was face sealed on a breathing manikin. A commonly used Type N95 respirator and surgical mask were utilized for the tests. The manikin was placed in a 24.3-m3 indoor test chamber and exposed to polydisperse surrogate aerosols simulating viral and bacterial particles with respect to the aerodynamic size. The particle penetration through the mask was found to decrease by one-to-two orders of magnitude as a result of continuous unipolar ion emission in the chamber. The flux of air ions migrated to the breathing zone and imparted electrical charges of the same polarity to the aerosol particles and the respirator filter surface. This created an electrostatic shield along the external surface of the filter, thus enhancing the protection characteristics provided by the respirator. The above performance enhancement effect is crucial for minimizing the infectious risk in the cases when the conventional filtering-facepiece respirators are not able to provide an adequate protection against airborne viruses and bacteria.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uk Lee, Byung; Yermakov, Mikhail; Grinshpun, Sergey A.","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a39088175c69e831f80a3ef74149d595a2dc0d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287371/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850204000898; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2004.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850204000898","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial particles","ultrafine aerosol particles","respirator filter surface","ultrafine aerosols","continuous emission of unipolar ions","surgical mask","respiratory mask","breathing manikin","conventional filtering-facepiece respirators","used Type N95 respirator","size distribution of fine","performance enhancement effect","result of continuous unipolar ion emission","surrogate aerosols","bacterial agents","breathing zone","airborne viruses","aerodynamic size","adequate protection","external surface","protection characteristics","novel concept","flux of air ions","m3 indoor test chamber","imparted electrical charges","cases","concentration","polarity","respect","real-time monitoring","infectious risk","electrostatic shield","orders of magnitude","particle penetration","tests","measurements"],"language":"en"},

The core circadian molecular clock modulates the innate immune response by controlling rhythmic pathogen recognition by the innate immune system and daily variations in cytokine gene expression. However, the molecular link between circadian genes and the innate immune system has remained unclear. Here, we showed that mice lacking the clock gene Per1 (Period1) are more susceptible to LPS/d-galactosamine (LPS/GalN)-induced macrophage-dependent ALF compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Per1 deletion caused a remarkable increase in the number of Kupffer cells (KCs) in the liver, resulting in an elevation of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS treatment. Loss of Per1 had no effect on the proliferation or apoptosis of macrophages; however, it enhanced the recruitment of macrophages, which was associated with an increase in CC chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) expression levels in monocytes/macrophages. Deletion of Ccr2 rescued d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in Per1(\u2212/\u2212) mice. We demonstrated that the upregulation of Ccr2 expression by Per1 deletion could be reversed by the synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03B3) antagonist GW9662. Further analysis indicated that PER1 binds to PPAR-\u03B3 on the Ccr2 promoter and enhanced the inhibitory effect of PPAR-\u03B3 on Ccr2 expression. These results reveal that Per1 reduces hepatic macrophage recruitment through interaction with PPAR-\u03B3 and prevents an excessive innate immune response in endotoxin-induced liver injury.","publish_time":"2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, T; Wang, Z; Yang, P; Xia, L; Zhou, M; Wang, S; Du, Jie; Zhang, J","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f534cb2b4a2d3482affcb6d7a1dd23be34f9321.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4855679.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27054331/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2016.9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Per1 deletion","innate immune system","PPAR-\u03B3","Loss of Per1","hepatic innate immune response","LPS-induced liver injury","clock gene Per1","excessive innate immune response","upregulation of Ccr2 expression","LPS treatment","Ccr2 promoter","expression levels","mice","endotoxin-induced liver injury","Deletion of Ccr2 rescued d-GalN","recruitment of macrophages","inhibitory effect of PPAR","cytokine gene expression","induced macrophage-dependent ALF","hepatic macrophage recruitment","apoptosis of macrophages","core circadian molecular clock","severity of acute liver failure","circadian genes","d-galactosamine","remarkable increase","molecular link","CC chemokine receptor","levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines","synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma","rhythmic pathogen recognition","daily variations","interaction","wild-type","number of Kupffer cells","Period1","KCs","elevation","proliferation","monocytes","bacterial lipopolysaccharide","antagonist GW9662","WT","results","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Despite the apparently low transmissibility of the virus at this stage, research preparedness against another SARS-like pandemic is an important precautionary strategy.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Jasper F.W.; Li, Kenneth S.M.; To, Kelvin K.W.; Cheng, Vincent C.C.; Chen, Honglin; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e74846054350d79eb8dcc0e2f4f3dd7e0b444539.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112628.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2012.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072791/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445312002885; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445312002885","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["novel coronavirus","coronavirus OC43","group B SARS coronavirus","novel virus","human betacoronavirus","lesser bamboo bat","similar clinical presentation","animals","bat coronaviruses HKU4","genus betacoronavirus","group C species","c EMC","genome sequencing","Japanese Pipistrelle bat of Hong Kong","instance of interspecies jumping of betacoronavirus","Saudi patient","HCoV-EMC","HKU5","positive RT-PCR test","management of infection","pandemic","laboratory diagnosis","stage","isolation","Qatar","research preparedness","pneumonia","bovine source","emergence","paucity of published information","renal failure","important precautionary strategy","emerging infectious pathogens","civet","Summary Fouchier","low transmissibility"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to examine perceptions and behaviours of the general public during the early phase of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the Netherlands. METHODS: Two cross-sectional and one follow-up online survey (survey 1, 30 April-4 May; survey 2, 15-19 June; survey 3, 11-20 August 2009). Adults aged 18 years and above participating in a representative Internet panel were invited (survey 1, n = 456; survey 2, n = 478; follow-up survey 3, n = 934). Main outcome measures were 1) time trends in risk perception, feelings of anxiety, and behavioural responses (survey 1-3) and 2) factors associated with taking preventive measures and strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future (survey 3). RESULTS: Between May and August 2009, the level of knowledge regarding Influenza A (H1N1) increased, while perceived severity of the new flu, perceived self-efficacy, and intention to comply with preventive measures decreased. The perceived reliability of information from the government decreased from May to August (62% versus 45%). Feelings of anxiety decreased from May to June, and remained stable afterwards. From June to August 2009, perceived vulnerability increased and more respondents took preventive measures (14% versus 38%). Taking preventive measures was associated with no children in the household, high anxiety, high self-efficacy, more agreement with statements on avoidance, and paying much attention to media information regarding Influenza A (H1N1). Having a strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future was associated with higher age, high perceived severity, high anxiety, high perceived efficacy of measures, high self-efficacy, and finding governmental information to be reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing trends over time in perceived severity and anxiety are consistent with the reality: the clinical picture of influenza turned out to be mild in course of time. Although (inter)national health authorities initially overestimated the case fatality rate, the public stayed calm and remained to have a relatively high intention to comply with preventive measures.","publish_time":"2011-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bults, Marloes; Beaujean, Desir\u00E9e JMA; de Zwart, Onno; Kok, Gerjo; van Empelen, Pepijn; van Steenbergen, Jim E; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Voeten, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne ACM","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04b9001d61d666e065f28a9e628991f4d76d71bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3091536.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21199571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza A"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preventive measures","high perceived efficacy of measures","high anxiety","high perceived severity","high intention","follow-up survey","high self-efficacy","perceived vulnerability","follow-up online survey","perceived reliability of information","Main outcome measures","feelings of anxiety","H1N1","strong intention","time trends","behavioural responses","risk perception","course of time","governmental information","clinical picture of influenza","media information","future","Decreasing trends","general public","new flu","case fatality rate","case of emerging infectious diseases","higher age","Research","reality","agreement","household","children","early phase","perceptions","behaviours","national health authorities","attention","statements","respondents","representative Internet panel","study","avoidance","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","pandemic","level of knowledge","years","METHODS","Netherlands","factors","Adults","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Emerging and reemerging pathologies are still considered to be dangerous to humanity because of the unique nature of these diseases: it is the encounter between two living organisms that have coexisted for millions of years within the people on the same planet without being previously recognized. These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents. Several emerging or reemerging infectious agents are organisms that could be used in biological control. The differentiation of a natural epidemic from a bioterrorian event is based on several epidemiological indices as well as on the molecular characterization of the pathogen(s) involved. The role of pathologists is indeed very important. It is in this context that this chapter aims to discuss the various scientific advances, particularly molecular, in terms of diagnosis of these diseases; the new discoveries in the role of nanotechnologies and nanobiosensors; and also the implication of biomarkers, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), since it was reported that a single miRNA has the ultimate capacity to target multiple genes simultaneously. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen and occupy a major role in the host\u2013parasite interaction and pathogenesis. It is in this context that various molecular and nanomethods for the detection of emerging viruses and experimental validation of miRNAs during quelling viruses target transcripts will be discussed in this chapter.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hammou, Rahma Ait; Benhassou, Mustapha; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/253e1f73a3b18a13b56894ab4c611029ab1d5579.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149755.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012814966900007X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012814966900007X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious agents","diagnosis of infectious diseases","human host","detection of emerging viruses","quelling viruses","various scientific advances","major role","molecular characterization","role of nanotechnologies","particular pathogen","role of pathologists","chapter","experimental validation of miRNAs","viral infection context","terms of diagnosis","living organisms","reemerging pathologies","spectrum of human disease","nanomethods","ultimate capacity","bioterrorian event","parasite interaction","new discoveries","natural epidemic","parasites","unique nature","vaccination","transcripts","bacteria","people","humanity","single miRNA","multiple genes","millions of years","implication of biomarkers","epidemiological indices","addition","microRNAs","factors","nanobiosensors","fungi","ecological agent","pathogenesis","encounter","damage","Abstract","interplay","planet","threat","humans","differentiation","antibiotics","biological control"],"language":"en"},

The search strategy aimed at retrieving studies focusing on RSV prevalence, burden, risk factors, and the routine clinical practice in the prevention and management of RSV infections in Latin American countries. Only articles published between January 2011 and December 2017 were considered. Results Eighteen studies were included. Percentages of RSV detection varied highly across included studies for adult subjects with respiratory infections (0% to 77.9%), influenza-like illness (1.0% to 16.4%) and community-acquired pneumonia (1.3% to 13.5%). Considerable percentages of hospitalization were reported for RSV-infected adults with influenza-like illness (40.9% and 69.9%) and community-acquired pneumonia (91.7%). Conclusions Recent RSV data regarding adult populations in Latin America are scarce. RSV was documented as a cause of illness in adults and the elderly, being identified in patients with acute respiratory infections, influenza-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia.

Conducting high-throughput primary screens using libraries of small molecules, close to 1 million members in size, requires the generation of large numbers of cells which are easily acquired, reliably enriched, and reproducibly responsive to standard positive controls. These cells need to be similar in form and function to their counterparts in human disease. In vitro assays that can be mechanized by using robots can therefore save time and costs. In selecting in vivo models, consideration must be given to the species and strain of animal chosen, the appropriateness of the model to human disease, the extent of animal husbandry required during the in-life pharmacological assessment, the technical aspects of generating the model and harvesting the tissues for analyses, the cost of research tools in terms of time and money (demyelinating and remyelinating agents, amount of compound to be generated), and the length of time required for drug testing in the model. A consideration of the translational aspects of the in vivo model compared to those used in the clinic is also important.

To do this, the Ictus Madrid Multidisciplinary Group proposes a series of recommendations. Methods Non-systematic bibliographic review of the available publications with the terms \u201Cstroke\u201D and \u201CCOVID-19\u201D or \u201Ccoronavirus\u201D or \u201CSARS-CoV-2\u201D, as well as other already known for the authors. We provide a document of recommendations as a result of the consensus of the Ictus Madrid Multidisciplinary Group and its Neurology Committee. Results Our recommendations are structured on five lines: (1) coordinate to guarantee the access to hospital care for stroke patients, (2) recognise potentially COVID-19 infected stroke patients, (3) organise to ensure the protection of healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infections, (4) neuroimaging and other procedures potentially associated to risks for COVID-19 infection should be reduced and secured to avoid contagion, and (5) at home as soon as possible and supported follow-up to optimise hospital occupancy. The procedure is shown summarised under the acronym CORONA (COordinate, Recognise, Organise, Neuroimaging, At home). Conclusions These recommendations can support the organisation of healthcare services for acute stroke care and the optimisation of their resources, guaranteeing the protection of healthcare professionals.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodr\u00EDguez-Pardo, J.; Fuentes, B.; Alonso de Leci\u00F1ana, M.; Campollo, J.; Calleja Casta\u00F1o, P.; Carneado Ruiz, J.; Egido Herrero, J.; Garc\u00EDa Leal, R.; Gil N\u00FA\u00F1ez, A.; G\u00F3mez Cerezo, J.

However, pharmacists\u2019 duty of care at this interface has not been fully explored. This qualitative study aimed to explore key stakeholders\u2019 perceptions about the challenges and enablers to pharmacists\u2019 adopting a professional role in patient care associated with the concurrent use of herbal medicines (HMs). METHODS: Participants were recruited from the expert pool of the National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development using purposive sampling and snowballing. Participants targeted included government, academics and practicing pharmacists. An interview guide was developed following a literature review and face-to-face, audiotaped interviews conducted with key stakeholders. RESULTS: Fourteen semi-structured interviews with both practicing pharmacists and key stakeholder representatives were conducted in China in 2017. Thematic analysis identified 6 main themes which focused on how TCM was integrated with WM in China. Participants agreed that pharmacists should at least assume a role in drug safety associated with concurrent use of TCM and WM. However, barriers were identified within the government, education, pharmacy, pharmacist and research sectors, indicating a lack of coordinated strategies to improve this area of healthcare. A lack of clarity in defining the pharmacists\u2019 role in this area and a disconnect between current regulatory standards and education/training system were the prominent themes. Participants looked towards the government to facilitate actions in the development of policies that support pharmacy practice and practice guidelines, and the review of competency standards, and registration criteria as being the most important enablers. CONCLUSION: Guiding principles that outline standards for pharmacy practice regarding HMs in an integrated healthcare system are considered a priority, requiring a joint effort from the government, professional organizations and universities.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Dongning; Hu, Hao; Harnett, Joanna E.; Ung, Carolina Oi Lam","journal":"Eur J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/449e0bfff2346cc5c155a85d259dbc5bb425f27f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102831.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288883/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382019310947; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382019310947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development","TCM","WM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Participants","pharmacy practice","pharmacists\u2019 role","China","professional role","included government","concurrent use of TCM","integrated healthcare system","training system","practice guidelines","health system","education","HMs","review of competency standards","pharmacists\u2019 duty of care","area of healthcare","WM","Licensed Pharmacist Development","current regulatory standards","key stakeholders\u2019 perceptions","key stakeholder representatives","development of policies","research sectors","audiotaped interviews","Western medicine","concurrent use of herbal medicines","literature review","professional organizations","patient care","important enablers","main themes","prominent themes","lack of clarity","National Research Center","Traditional Chinese Medicine","semi-structured interviews","lack of coordinated strategies","purposive sampling","registration criteria","expert pool","priority","challenges","joint effort","Guiding principles","drug safety","snowballing","academics","qualitative study","Thematic analysis","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSION","interface","universities","actions","interview guide","barriers","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

It is extremely difficult to build a general assembler that is able to reconstruct the original sequence instead of many contigs. However, we believe that creating specific assemblers, for solving specific cases, will be much more fruitful than creating general assemblers. FINDINGS: In this paper, we present Arapan-S, a whole-genome assembly program dedicated to handling small genomes. It provides only one contig (along with the reverse complement of this contig) in many cases. Although genomes consist of a number of segments, the implemented algorithm can detect all the segments, as we demonstrate for Influenza Virus A. The Arapan-S program is based on the de Bruijn graph. We have implemented a very sophisticated and fast method to reconstruct the original sequence and neglect erroneous k-mers. The method explores the graph by using neither the shortest nor the longest path, but rather a specific and reliable path based on the coverage level or k-mers\u2019 lengths. Arapan-S uses short reads, and it was tested on raw data downloaded from the NCBI Trace Archive. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the accuracy of the assembly was very high; the result was checked against the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) database using the NCBI BLAST Sequence Similarity Search. The identity and the genome coverage was more than 99%. We also compared the efficiency of Arapan-S with other well-known assemblers. In dealing with small genomes, the accuracy of Arapan-S is significantly higher than the accuracy of other assemblers. The assembly process is very fast and requires only a few seconds. Arapan-S is available for free to the public. The binary files for Arapan-S are available through http://sourceforge.net/projects/dnascissor/files/.","publish_time":"2012-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahli, Mohammed; Shibuya, Tetsuo","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7398c3a708a291677e55854601f643ba41d79916.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3441218.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-5-243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22591859/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Virus A.

Human beings become infected through tick bites, by crushing infected ticks, after contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock. Clinical features commonly show a dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage, myalgia, and fever. The levels of liver enzymes, creatinine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase are raised, and bleeding markers are prolonged. Infection of the endothelium has a major pathogenic role. Besides direct infection of the endothelium, indirect damage by viral factors or virus-mediated host-derived soluble factors that cause endothelial activations and dysfunction are thought to occur. In diagnosis, enzyme-linked immunoassay and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR are used. Early diagnosis is critical for patient therapy and prevention of potential nosocomial infections. Supportive therapy is the most essential part of case management. Recent studies suggest that ribavirin is effective against CCHF, although definitive studies are not available. Health-care workers have a serious risk of infection, particularly during care of patients with haemorrhages from the nose, mouth, gums, vagina, and injection sites.

Sixty herds with a herd size of \u2265160 cows were visited once between December 2005 and March 2006. Thirty herds were known to have low mortality (LM) and 30 were known high mortality herds (HM). Upon the visit, data about housing and management was collected from interviews with personnel responsible for the calves. The herd status regarding the calves\u2019 passive transfer (total protein), levels of \u03B1-tocopherol, \u03B2-carotene and retinol, and excretion of faecal pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli F5, rota and corona virus) was evaluated based on targeted sampling of high risk calf groups; in each herd, blood and faecal samples were collected from calves 1\u20137 and 1\u201314 days old, respectively. Similarly, the herd status regarding clinical respiratory disease in calves and history of respiratory virus exposure was evaluated based on lung auscultations and blood samplings of calves 60\u201390 days old. The median calf mortality risk (in calves 1\u201390 days of age) among HM herds was 9% (Range: 6\u201324%) and among LM herds 1% (Range: 0\u20132%). LM and HM herds were compared using five logistic regression models, covering potential risk factors within different areas: \u201CDisease susceptibility\u201D, \u201CFactors affecting the gastrointestinal tract\u201D, \u201CFactors related to transmission of infectious disease\u201D, \u201CHygiene\u201D and \u201CLabour management\u201D. The percentage of calves, 1\u20137 days old, with inadequate serum concentrations of \u03B1-tocopherol and \u03B2-carotene were significantly higher in HM herds compared to LM herds and also associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR=1.02; p =0.023 and OR=1.05; p =0.0028, respectively). The variable \u201CAverage number of faecal pathogens in the sampled target group\u201D was significantly associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR=4.65; p =0.015), with a higher average in HM herds. The percentage of calves with diarrhoea treated with antibiotics was significantly higher in HM herds and was associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR=1.08; p =0.021). The median age at death of calves in the age interval 1\u201390 days that died during a one-year period was significantly lower among HM herds (13 days) than in LM herds (24 days) (p =0.0013) The results indicate that gastrointestinal disorders may be an important cause of calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds. Furthermore, our study provides additional indications that fat soluble vitamins might play an important role for calf health.","publish_time":"2011-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torsein, Maria; Lindberg, Ann; Sandgren, Charlotte Hall\u00E9n; Waller, Karin Persson; T\u00F6rnquist, Mats; Svensson, Catarina","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab77b7faa3d2ca4577c472c8bcdeecbfe6c0373d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132482.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587710003429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257214/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587710003429; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.12.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HM herds","LM herds","high mortality herds","large Swedish dairy herds","percentage of calves","days of age","days old","death of calves","herd status","higher odds","median calf mortality risk","higher average","herd size","day calf mortality","blood samplings of calves","important cause of calf mortality","potential risk factors","possible risk factors","calf health","low mortality","median age","targeted sampling of high risk calf groups","excretion of faecal pathogens","tocopherol","clinical respiratory disease","\u03B2-carotene","Average number of faecal pathogens","faecal samples","Disease susceptibility","study","age interval","Range","transmission of infectious disease","levels of \u03B1","important role","history of respiratory virus exposure","corona virus","gastrointestinal disorders","gastrointestinal tract","Labour management","inadequate serum concentrations of \u03B1","Escherichia coli F5","fat soluble vitamins","calves\u2019 passive transfer","total protein","Cryptosporidium","different areas","retinol","logistic regression models","lung auscultations","additional indications","rota","interviews","sampled target group","antibiotics","housing","Hygiene","variable","diarrhoea","personnel responsible","year period","visit","data","results","cows","aim"],"language":"en"},

Camel and bats have been identified as a potential source of virus for disease spread to human. Although, significant information related to MERS-CoV disease, spread, infection, epidemiology, clinical features have been published, A little information is available on the sequence diversity of Spike protein gene. The Spike protein gene plays a significant role in virus attachment to host cells. Recently, the information about recombinant MERS-CoV has been published. So, this work was designed to identify the emergence of any another recombinant virus in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In this study samples were collected from both human and camels and the Spike protein gene was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of MERS-CoV Spike protein gene were used to analyze the recombination, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship with selected sequences from Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 65.7% to 99.8% among all the samples collected from human and camels from various locations in the Kingdom. The lowest similarity (65.7%) was observed in samples from Madinah and Dammam. The phylogenetic relationship formed different clusters with multiple isolates from various locations. The sample collected from human in Jeddah hospital formed a closed cluster with human samples collected from Buraydah, while camel sample formed a closed cluster with Hufuf isolates. The phylogenetic tree by using Aminoacid sequences formed closed cluster with Dammam, Makkah and Duba isolates. The amino acid sequences variations were observed in 28/35 samples and two unique amino acid sequences variations were observed in all samples analyzed while total 19 nucleotides sequences variations were observed in the Spike protein gene. The minor recombination events were identified in eight different sequences at various hotspots in both human and camel samples using recombination detection programme. CONCLUSION: The generated information from this study is very valuable and it will be used to design and develop therapeutic compounds and vaccine to control the MERS-CoV disease spread in not only in the Kingdom but also globally.","publish_time":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sohrab, Sayed S.; Azhar, Esam I.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/575eb53a312d827a688f809be60e1eb0bc52d99d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831395/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119303454; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.11.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119303454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hufuf"],"locations":["Middle East","Jeddah","Saudi Arabia","Dammam"],"keyphrases":["human samples","camel samples","CoV Spike protein gene","MERS-CoV disease","different sequences","amino acid sequences of MERS","study samples","selected sequences","Aminoacid sequences","recombinant MERS-CoV","sequence diversity of Spike protein gene","nucleotides sequences variations","unique amino acid sequences variations","closed cluster","significant information","phylogenetic relationship","recombinant virus","various locations","little information","generated information","various hotspots","multiple isolates","virus attachment","phylogenetic tree","Dammam","camels","Saudi Arabia","Duba isolates","Hufuf isolates","Kingdom","recombination detection programme","potential source of virus","nucleotide sequence identity","minor recombination events","different clusters","genetic diversity","significant role","Jeddah hospital","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","BACKGROUND","infection","Makkah","Buraydah","epidemiology","vaccine","clinical features","cells","RESULTS","emergence","therapeutic compounds","CONCLUSION","bats","METHODS","Madinah","lowest similarity","work"],"language":"en"},

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was engineered to express porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) small protein domains, as a strategy to improve heterologous gene stability. After serial passage in tissue cultures, stable expression of small PRRSV protein antigenic domains was achieved. Therefore, size reduction of the heterologous genes inserted in CoV-derived vectors led to the stable expression of antigenic domains. Immunization of piglets with these TGEV vectors led to partial protection against a challenge with a virulent PRRSV strain, as immunized animals showed reduced clinical signs and lung damage.

Our objective was to evaluate the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears associated with term induction of labor. This section of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada contains the oral, poster, and video abstracts that were to be presented at the SOGC\u0027s 76th Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference (ACSC) to have been held from June 9 to 12, 2020, in Ottawa, Ontario, and included as part of the conference proceedings. Due to the global spread of COVID-19 and the increasing health and safety measures being put in place by all levels of government, the SOGC has cancelled the 2020 ACSC. As a result, abstract participants will instead be submitting their presentations with voice-over narration. The presentations will then be posted on the 2020 ACSC Abstract Program page of sogc.org. We invite you to visit this page in early June to participate in the 2020 Abstract Program and to learn about the exciting research being conducted and innovations emerging in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology. There will also be an opportunity to ask authors questions. I would like to thank the entire Abstract Program Committee, the reviewers, and the participants, without whom the ACSC Abstract Program would not be possible. Dr. Alain Gagnon Chair, Abstract Program Committee Methods We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using the United States\u0027 Nationwide Inpatient Sample to evaluate the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears in women who underwent IOL at term between 2005 and 2014. We included all term livebirths and excluded, preterm births, previous cesarean deliveries, multifetal gestations, and non-cephalic presentation. Women who underwent an IOL at term were identified using ICD-9 coding. Patient characteristics were compared between those women being induced at term with those who weren\u0027t, and logistic regression analysis were carried out to estimate the adjusted effect of IOL at term with risk of 3rd and 4th perineal tears. Results Among 5,982,945 eligible live births, 1,035,003 (17.3%) underwent an IOL at term, increasing from 15.7% to 18.5%. Women with an IOL were more likely to be older, Caucasian, and with comorbid illnesses. Compared with women who did not undergo an IOL, women in the IOL group had lower risk of cesarean deliveries, 0.89 (0.88\u20130.89), 2nd degree tears, 0.89 (0.89\u20130.90), 3rd degree tears, OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.79\u20130.82) and 4th degree tears, OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.82\u20130.87). Conclusions Induction of labor at term results in significantly lower risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears among all deliveries as well as among women with vaginal deliveries.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Wahaibi, Suhaila; Czuzoj-Shulman, Nicholas; Abenhaim, Haim","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2020.02.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1701216320301055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1701216320301055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alain Gagnon"],"organizations":["Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada","SOGC","sogc.org","Abstract Program Committee","ACSC Abstract Program"],"locations":["Ottawa"],"keyphrases":["women","degree tears","degree perineal tears","term results","term induction of labor","term livebirths","IOL group","ACSC Abstract Program page of","abstract participants","Abstract Program Committee Methods","entire Abstract Program Committee","adjusted effect of IOL","lower risk of cesarean deliveries","vaginal deliveries","previous cesarean deliveries","Conclusions Induction of labor","rate of induction","increasing health","presentations","preterm births","Journal of Obstetrics","Gynaecology Canada","field of obstetrics","Scientific Conference","conference proceedings","eligible live births","multifetal gestations","population","Alain Gagnon Chair","retrospective cohort study","poster","Nationwide Inpatient Sample","reviewers","non-cephalic presentation","place","Caucasian","innovations","SOGC\u0027s","safety measures","levels of government","video abstracts","Objectives","ICD","global spread of COVID","comorbid illnesses","exciting research","logistic regression analysis","opportunity","authors questions","voice-over narration","section","Patient characteristics","Ottawa","Ontario","coding","years"],"language":"en"},

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the identification of pteropid bats (flying-foxes) as the natural host of the virus, and it is timely to reflect on a pivotal meeting of an eclectic group of scientists in that process. They included animal and public health experts, environmental scientists, veterinary and horse industry representatives, and wildlife experts. The task was to review and prioritise wildlife surveillance seeking the origin of the previously unknown virus. The group determined that the likely reservoir must occur in disparate locations, and be capable of moving between locations, or exist in continuous, overlapping populations spanning multiple locations. Flying-foxes were considered to be a more probable source of the novel virus than birds. Within weeks, antibodies were detected in several species of flying-fox, and the virus was subsequently isolated. While the identification of the natural host of Hendra virus within 18 months of its description was remarkable in itself, a broader legacy followed. In the subsequent years, a suite of zoonotic viruses including Australian bat lyssavirus, Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola and Marburg viruses have been detected in bats. Bats are now the \u201Cgo to\u201D taxa for novel viruses. History has repeatedly demonstrated that knowledge begets knowledge. This simple notion of bringing a diverse group of people together in an environment of mutual respect reinforced this principle and proves that the sum is often so much more powerful than the parts.","publish_time":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Black, Peter; Douglas, Ian; Field, Hume","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3f8dab7ff123599384b8454a91dea037c2f27e9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e089ff4d29cdcec046fc0226a0db69058101ae6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5441360.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771415000038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771415000038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616459/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2015.07.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Brisbane","Hendra"],"keyphrases":["Nipah virus","unknown virus","natural host of Hendra virus","novel viruses","eclectic group of scientists","Marburg viruses","wildlife experts","disparate locations","multiple locations","identification of pteropid bats","foxes","species of flying","knowledge","suite of zoonotic viruses","diverse group of people","Brisbane suburb of Hendra","environmental scientists","wildlife surveillance","public health experts","Australian bat lyssavirus","human cases","SARS coronavirus","thoroughbred racing stable","horse industry representatives","Ebola","months","cluster of fatal equine","pivotal meeting","principle","environment of mutual respect","animal","anniversary","likely reservoir","origin","subsequent years","probable source","populations","simple notion","description","process","birds","antibodies","sum","broader legacy","taxa","parts","weeks","History","task"],"language":"en"},

A new concept, \u201CMultiprobe QPCR\u201D, which uses a balanced mixture of competing discrete non- or moderately degenerated nuclease degradable (TaqMan\u00AE) probes was employed. It provides a broadly targeted and rational single tube real-time reverse transcription PCR (\u201CNQPCR\u201D) for the generic detection and discovery of CoV. Degenerate primers, previously published, and the new probes, were from a conserved stretch of open reading frame 1b, encoding the replicase. This multiprobe design reduced the degree of probe degeneration, which otherwise decreases the sensitivity, and allowed a preliminary classification of the amplified sequence directly from the QPCR trace. The split probe strategy allowed detection of down to 10 viral nucleic acid equivalents of CoV from all known CoV groups. Evaluation was with reference CoV strains, synthetic targets, human respiratory samples and avian fecal samples. Infectious-Bronchitis-Virus (IBV)-related variants were found in 7 of 35 sample pools, from 100 wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Ducks may spread and harbour CoVs. NQPCR can detect a wide range of CoVs, as illustrated for humans and ducks.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muradrasoli, Shaman; Mohamed, Nahla; Horny\u00E1k, \u00C1kos; Fohlman, Jan; Olsen, Bj\u00F6rn; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Blomberg, Jonas","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08ec0c23dc71090d85a165e7f73e21b3bb8d92aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112901.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409001980; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409001980; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.04.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19406168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QPCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wide range of CoVs","discovery of CoV","harbour CoVs","reference CoV strains","known CoV groups","host range","NQPCR","generic detection","Detection methods","Multiprobe QPCR","humans","new probes","Ducks","viral nucleic acid equivalents of CoV","viral evolution","QPCR trace","multiprobe design","new concept","human respiratory samples","avian fecal samples","degree of probe degeneration","split probe strategy","synthetic targets","rational single tube real-time reverse transcription PCR","transmission","degenerated nuclease degradable","conserved stretch of open reading frame","wild mallards","IBV","amplified sequence","fatal disease","preliminary classification","TaqMan","maintenance","balanced mixture","sensitivity","Anas platyrhynchos","Infectious-Bronchitis","related variants","sample pools","animals","reservoirs","Evaluation","Abstract Coronaviruses","replicase","Degenerate primers"],"language":"en"},

HPV infection is a highly infectious disease; about 65% of partners of individuals with genital warts will develop genital condylomatosis. Only in 20-30% it regresses spontaneously and relapse rates range deeply (9-80%). Echinacea extracts possess antiviral and immunomodulator activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, using a formulation based on HPVADL18\u00AE (on dry extracts of 200 mg Echinacea Purpurea (EP) roots plus E. Angustifolia (EA)), on the posttreatment relapse incidence of genital condylomatosis. Materials and Methods. It is a prospective single-arm study. Patients with a satisfactory and positive vulvoscopy, colposcopy, or peniscopy for genital condylomatosis were divided into two random groups and subjected to destructive therapy with Co2 Laser. Group A (N=64) immediately after the laser therapy started a 4-month treatment with oral HPVADL18\u00AE; Group B (N=61) did not undergo any additional therapy. Patients were subjected to a follow-up after 1, 6, and 12 months. Differences in relapse incidence between the two groups during follow-up controls were evaluated by \u03C72-test; the groups were stratified by age, gender, and condylomatosis extension degree. Results and Discussion. Gender, age, and condyloma lesions\u0027 extension degree showed no statistically significant differences between the two trial groups. The relapse incidence differs statistically between the two studied groups and progressively decreases during the 12 months after treatment in both groups. Statistically significant reduction of relapse rates has been shown in Group A in patients over 25 years old. This difference is significant for both men and women. The relapse incidence is superior in case of extended condylomatosis. Conclusions. In conclusion, the presence of a latent infection causes condylomatosis relapse; in order to reduce the relapse risk an induction of a protective immune response seems to be essential to allow rapid viral clearance from genital areas surrounding lesion and treatment zones. Echinacea promotes this process. EP and EA dry root extracts seem to be a valid adjuvant therapy in reducing relapse incidence of lesions in patients treated for genital condylomatosis.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Rosa, Nicoletta; Giampaolino, Pierluigi; Lavitola, Giada; Morra, Ilaria; Formisano, Carmen; Nappi, Carmine; Bifulco, Giuseppe","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9493e8464b3aa6f684f6ea54438d763dd82ce23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6487159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111049/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/3548396","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Echinacea","EA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["condylomatosis relapse","posttreatment relapse incidence of genital condylomatosis","relapse incidence of lesions","Patients","significant reduction of relapse rates","condylomatosis extension degree","genital areas","genital warts","random groups","laser therapy","trial groups","studied groups","Echinacea extracts","case of extended condylomatosis","destructive therapy","additional therapy","dry extracts","significant differences","valid adjuvant therapy","age","EA dry root extracts","EP","month treatment","gender","Echinacea Purpurea","treatment zones","Group B","months","condyloma lesions\u0027 extension degree","oral HPVADL18","latent infection","HPV infection","follow-up controls","Co2 Laser","prospective single-arm study","colposcopy","rapid viral clearance","positive vulvoscopy","roots","peniscopy","protective immune response","induction","immunomodulator activities","presence","partners of individuals","order","infectious disease","\u03C72-test","Angustifolia","years old","women","efficacy","formulation","Results","Discussion","Materials","Methods","aim","process","Introduction","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the discovery that this naturally occurring antibiotic inhibits two human neutral aminopeptidases, the cell-surface alanine aminopeptidase and intracellular methionine aminopeptidase type 2. These metallo-containing exopeptidases participate in tumor cell expansion and motility and are targets for anticancer therapies. We show that the peptide portions of Actinomycin D and Actinomycin X(2) are not required for effective inhibition, but the loss of these regions changes the mechanism of interaction. Two structurally less complex Actinomycin D analogs containing the phenoxazone chromophores, Questiomycin A and Actinocin, appear to be competitive inhibitors of both aminopeptidases, with potencies similar to the non-competitive macrocyclic parent compound (K(i) in the micromolar range). The mode of action for all four compounds and both enzymes was demonstrated by molecular modeling and docking in the corresponding active sites. This knowledge gives new perspectives to Actinomycin D\u0027s action on tumors and suggests new avenues and molecules for medical applications.","publish_time":"2018-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"W\u0119glarz-Tomczak, Ewelina; Talma, Micha\u0142; Giurg, Miros\u0142aw; Westerhoff, Hans V.; Janowski, Robert; Mucha, Artur","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a03f649135d42858e9619d36c614d8faff51dafb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6047675.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.25532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30034623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Actinomycin D and Actinomycin X"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Actinomycin X","Actinomycin D\u0027s action","complex Actinomycin D analogs","peptide portions of Actinomycin D","potent transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D","cell-surface alanine aminopeptidase","new avenues","new perspectives","mode of action","tumor cell expansion","human neutral aminopeptidases","intracellular methionine aminopeptidase type","tumors","phenoxazone chromophores","potencies similar","Actinocin","motility","molecules","non-competitive macrocyclic parent compound","loss","Questiomycin","antibiotic","exopeptidases","medical applications","knowledge","molecular modeling","competitive inhibitors","regions","corresponding active sites","enzymes","compounds","mechanism of interaction","effective inhibition","anticancer therapies","metallo","cancers","micromolar range"],"language":"en"},

Another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals, such as receiving vaccination, taking antiviral drugs, and wearing face masks. These two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment, but little attention has been paid to their combined effectiveness. This article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, USA. Three control strategies are investigated, including: Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis (TAP), workplace/school closure, community travel restriction, as well as the combination of the three. All control strategies are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior, and the resulting effectiveness are compared. The simulation outcomes suggest that weaker control strategies could suffice to contain influenza epidemics, because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior, rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected. The preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for control strategies and avoid unnecessary socio-economic interruptions. This research adds a human behavioral dimension into the simulation of control strategies and offers new insights into disease containment. Health policy makers are recommended to review current control strategies and comprehend preventive behavior patterns of local populations before making decisions on influenza containment.","publish_time":"2011-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Liang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac0ed4e3ae92a0e194ea6808c289a0b6224ea054.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3197180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043275/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024706","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["simulation of control strategies","weaker control strategies","current control strategies","weaker strategies","individual preventive behavior","voluntary preventive behavior of individuals","influenza containment","preventive behavior patterns of local populations","influenza epidemics","influenza outbreaks","combined effectiveness","simulation outcomes","disease containment","resulting effectiveness","established simulation models","major type of practice","health agencies","antiviral drugs","Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis","Health policy makers","workplace","school closure","TAP","urbanized area of Buffalo","medical resources","new insights","community travel restriction","decisions","human behavioral dimension","unnecessary socio-economic interruptions","NY","effects","regard","little attention","USA","research","face masks","types of practices","vaccination","article","combination"],"language":"en"},

We previously synthesized a siRNA targeting the CVB3 protease 2A (siRNA/2A) gene and achieved reduction of CVB3 replication by 92% in vitro. However, like other drugs under development, CVB3 siRNA faces a major challenge of targeted delivery. In this study, we investigated a novel approach to deliver CVB3 siRNAs to a specific cell population (e.g. HeLa cells containing folate receptor) using receptor ligand (folate)-linked packaging RNA (pRNA) from bacterial phage phi29. pRNA monomers can spontaneously form dimers and multimers under optimal conditions by base-pairing between their stem loops. By covalently linking a fluorescence-tag to folate, we delivered the conjugate specifically to HeLa cells without the need of transfection. We further demonstrated that pRNA covalently conjugated to siRNA/2A achieved an equivalent antiviral effect to that of the siRNA/2A alone. Finally, the drug targeted delivery was further evaluated by using pRNA monomers or dimers, which carried both the siRNA/2A and folate ligand and demonstrated that both of them strongly inhibited CVB3 replication. These data indicate that pRNA as a siRNA carrier can specifically deliver the drug to target cells via its ligand and specific receptor interaction and inhibit virus replication effectively.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Huifang M.; Su, Yue; Guo, Songchuan; Yuan, Ji; Lim, Travis; Liu, Jing; Guo, Peixuan; Yang, Decheng","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fc964edc8caa954ef927084e340589d921b2061.json; document_parses/pdf_json/75b4753729660bd91c683672c7d54cf9881fd42d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3909712.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.07.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209003830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19616030/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209003830; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3909712?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxsackievirus B3"],"organizations":["HeLa"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["siRNA carrier","folate receptor","folate ligand","CVB3 siRNAs","CVB3 protease","pRNA monomers","reduction of CVB3 replication","inhibited CVB3 replication","receptor ligand","HeLa cells","specific receptor interaction","dimers","virus replication","drug targeted delivery","major challenge of targeted delivery","specific cell population","linked packaging RNA","base","multimers","optimal conditions","bacterial phage phi29","novel approach","development","gene","common pathogen of myocarditis","equivalent antiviral effect","need of transfection","conjugate","drugs","Coxsackievirus B3","stem loops","study","fluorescence-tag","data"],"language":"en"},

We performed a small-scale experiment to test the possibility of infectious virus carryover on the surface of different fabrics used in commercially available protective gowns. Application of a lentivirus vector that expresses green fluorescent protein allowed easy monitoring of infectious viral loads on fabrics. Results indicate that fabrics of level-3 surgical gowns serve better to reduce virus transmission compared to fabrics of chemical protective clothing with the same or higher barrier efficiency. Analysis of sliding angles provided indexes of fluid repellency, which were inversely related to virus carryover potentials.

These diseases arise from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors, which collaborate to cause increased susceptibility and severity. Many asthma susceptibility genes are linked to the immune system or encode enzymes like metalloproteases (e.g., ADAM-33) or serine proteases. The S9 family of serine proteases (prolyl oligopeptidases) is capable to process peptide bonds adjacent to proline, a kind of cleavage-resistant peptide bonds present in many growth factors, chemokines or cytokines that are important for asthma. Curiously, two serine proteases within the S9 family encoded by genes located on chromosome 2 appear to have a role in asthma: CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and DPP10. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about CD26 and to provide a structured overview of the numerous functions and implications that this versatile enzyme could have in this disease, especially after the detection of some secondary effects (e.g., viral nasopharyngitis) in type II diabetes mellitus patients (a subset with a certain risk of developing obesity-related asthma) upon CD26 inhibitory therapy.","publish_time":"2016-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieto-Fontarigo, Juan J.; Gonz\u00E1lez-Barcala, Francisco J.; San Jos\u00E9, Esther; Arias, Pilar; Nogueira, Montserrat; Salgado, Francisco J.","journal":"Clin Rev Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090975.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27561663/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-016-8578-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma susceptibility genes","S9 family of serine proteases","peptide bonds adjacent","certain risk of developing obesity-related asthma","CD26 inhibitory therapy","resistant peptide bonds present","growth factors","chronic inflammatory family of disorders","genetic factors","increased susceptibility","kind of cleavage","reversible bronchial obstruction","subset","prolyl oligopeptidases","viral nasopharyngitis","numerous functions","diabetes mellitus patients","expiratory airflow limitation","implications","type","chemokines","airways","proline","cytokines","dipeptidyl peptidase","versatile enzyme","increasing prevalence","immune system","structured overview","secondary effects","enzymes","metalloproteases","interaction","DPP4","ADAM","role","review","detection","current knowledge","chromosome","diseases","DPP10","severity","aim"],"language":"en"},

In addition to physical symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common following outbreaks of EID. METHODS The present study investigated the long-term mental health outcomes and related risk factors in survivors of MERS. A prospective nationwide cohort study was conducted 12 months after the MERS outbreak at multi-centers throughout Korea. PTSD and depression as the main mental health outcomes were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Korean version (IES-R-K) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) respectively. RESULTS 42.9% of survivors reported PTSD (IES-R-K \u2265 25) and 27.0% reported depression (PHQ-9 \u2265 10) at 12 months post-MERS. A multivariate analysis revealed that anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.76; 95%CI, 1.29-25.58; P = 0.021), and a greater recognition of stigma (aOR, 11.09, 95%CI, 2.28-53.90; P = 0.003) during the MERS-affected period were independent predictors of PTSD at 12 months after the MERS outbreak. Having a family member who died from MERS predicted the development of depression (aOR, 12.08, 95%CI, 1.47-99.19; P = 0.020). CONCLUSION This finding implies that psychosocial factors, particularly during the outbreak phase, influenced the mental health of patients over a long-term period. Mental health support among the infected subjects and efforts to reduce stigma may improve recovery from psychological distress in an EID outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Hye Yoon; Park, Wan Beom; Lee, So Hee; Kim, Jeong Lan; Lee, Jung Jae; Lee, Haewoo; Shin, Hyoung-Shik","journal":"BMC public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410603/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08726-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID","MERS","Patient Health Questionnaire-9","PTSD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS outbreak","survivors of MERS","months post-MERS","EID outbreak","Mental health support","mental health of patients","long-term mental health outcomes","main mental health outcomes","outbreak phase","aOR","development of depression","Patient Health Questionnaire","independent predictors of PTSD","long-term period","IES-R","PHQ","outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","common following outbreaks of EID","present study","prospective nationwide cohort study","psychosocial factors","Republic of Korea","related risk factors","greater recognition of stigma","representative occurrence of nationwide outbreaks of Emerging Infectious Diseases","posttraumatic stress disorder","anxiety","infected subjects","physical symptoms","Korean version","efforts","adjusted odds ratio","recovery","psychological distress","Impact of Event Scale","multi-centers","addition","EIDs","multivariate analysis","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","family member","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although the pathogenesis of HFRS is unclear, some reports have suggested that the abundant production of proinflammatory cytokines and uncontrolled inflammatory responses may contribute to the development of HFRS. CXCL10 is one of these cytokines and is found to be involved in the pathogenesis of many virus infectious diseases. However, the role of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of HFRS and the molecular regulation mechanism of CXCL10 in HTNV infection remain unknown. In this study, we report that CXCL10 expresses highly in the HFRS patients\u0027 sera and the elevated CXCL10 is positively correlated with the severity of HFRS. We find that HTNV, a single-strand RNA virus, can act as a double-strand RNA to activate the TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 signaling pathways. Through the downstream transcription factors of these pathways, NF-\u03BAB and IRF7, which bind directly to the CXCL10\u0027s promoter, the expression of CXCL10 is increased. Our results may help to better understand the role of CXCL10 in the development of HFRS and may provide some novel insights into the immune response of HTNV infection.","publish_time":"2014-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yusi; Liu, Bei; Ma, Ying; Yi, Jing; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhang, Yun; Xu, Zhuwei; Wang, Jiuping; Yang, Kun; Yang, Angang; Zhuang, Ran; Jin, Boquan","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1f90c0a862d8dc3485d61deb8c87c0b53b798b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3950924.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/697837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFRS","HTNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of HFRS","role of CXCL10","elevated CXCL10","expression of CXCL10","development of HFRS","severity of HFRS","HFRS patients\u0027 sera","molecular regulation mechanism of CXCL10","immune response of HTNV infection","single-strand RNA virus","pathways","Hantaan virus","double-strand RNA","virus infectious diseases","abundant production of proinflammatory cytokines","hemorrhagic fever","major agent","uncontrolled inflammatory responses","renal syndrome","novel insights","NF-\u03BAB","reports","s promoter","downstream transcription factors","RIG","IRF7","TLR3","MDA","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Among these, viruses are especially difficult to tackle due to the sudden transfer from animals to humans, high mutational rates, resistance to current treatments, and the intricacies of their molecular interactions with the host. As an example of these interactions, we describe a cell-based approach to monitor specific proteolytic events executed by either the viral-encoded protease or by host proteins on the virus. We then emphasize the significance of examining proteolysis within the subcellular compartment where cleavage occurs naturally. We show the power of stable expression, highlighting the usefulness of the cell-based multiplexed approach, which we have adapted to two independent assays previously developed to monitor (a) the activity of the HIV-1-encoded protease or (b) the cleavage of the HIV-1-encoded envelope protein by the host. Multiplexing was achieved by mixing cells each carrying a different assay or, alternatively, by engineering cells expressing two assays. Multiplexing relies on the robustness of the individual assays and their clear discrimination, further enhancing screening capabilities in an attempt to block proteolytic events required for viral infectivity and spread.","publish_time":"2016-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbadessa, Darin; Smurthwaite, Cameron A.; Reed, Connor W.; Wolkowicz, Roland","journal":"Biochem Insights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30cde71f98e1b4202ba43473e686ec4b5b23d42f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5034881.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4137/bci.s30379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27688710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multiplexing"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral-encoded protease","HIV","host proteins","cell-based approach","cleavage","individual assays","independent assays","Multiplexing","specific proteolytic events","encoded envelope protein","viral infectivity","multiplexed approach","engineering cells","molecular interactions","advances","humans","high mutational rates","human health","biomedical research","animals","resistance","current treatments","clear discrimination","screening capabilities","sudden transfer","Infectious diseases","drug discovery","proteolysis","usefulness","intricacies","attempt","subcellular compartment","robustness","power of stable expression","different assay","significance","viruses","example","activity"],"language":"en"},

For many, the guidance has led to new ways of working, most notably a shift towards working remotely. While eye care practitioners (ECPs) may continue to provide urgent or emergency eye care, in many cases the travel restrictions present a unique challenge by preventing conventional face-to-face examination. Telephone triage provides a useful starting point for establishing at-risk and emergency patients; but patient examination is central to contact lens patient care. The indeterminate period over which conventional practice will be suspended, and the risk that resumption of \u0027normal\u0027 practice could be impeded by a potential secondary peak in COVID-19 cases, hastens the need for practitioners to adapt their delivery of eyecare. Specifically, it is prudent to reflect upon supportive evidence for more comprehensive approaches to teleoptometry in contact lens practice. Smartphone based ocular imaging is an area which has seen considerable growth, particularly for imaging the posterior eye. Smartphone imaging of the anterior eye requires additional specialised instrumentation unlikely to be available to patients at home. Further, there is only limited evidence for self-administered image capture. In general, digital photographs, are useful for detection of gross anterior eye changes, but subtle changes are less discernible. For the assessment of visual acuity, many electronic test charts have been validated for use by practitioners. Research into self-administered visual acuity measures remains limited. The absence of a comprehensive evidence base for teleoptometry limits ECPs, particularly during this pandemic. Knowledge gaps ought to be addressed to facilitate development of optometry specific evidence-based guidance for telecare. In particular, advances in ocular self-imaging could help move this field forwards.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagra, Manbir; Vianya-Estopa, Marta; Wolffsohn, James S.","journal":"Cont Lens Anterior Eye","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79e654b51758bd4e7699ee142fc8cf13e624c703.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165279.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367048420300758?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367048420300758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eye care practitioners","emergency eye care","limited evidence","posterior eye","ocular imaging","Smartphone imaging","supportive evidence","conventional practice","comprehensive evidence base","lens patient care","ocular self-imaging","contact lens practice","detection of gross anterior eye changes","cases","emergency patients","patient examination","travel restrictions","COVID","pandemic","development of optometry specific evidence-based guidance","self-administered visual acuity measures","teleoptometry limits ECPs","assessment of visual acuity","conventional face-to-face examination","comprehensive approaches","subtle changes","useful starting point","government-imposed restrictions","self-administered image capture","new ways of working","additional specialised instrumentation unlikely","unique challenge","electronic test charts","social interactions","area","digital photographs","Telephone triage","potential secondary peak","advances","Research","telecare","resumption","indeterminate period","need","absence","considerable growth","delivery of eyecare","field forwards","risk","home","Knowledge gaps","shift"],"language":"en"},

Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being \u003C2000 km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fleming, Theodore H.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33ea9c98c7d8c301024203604335c77ebae7b606.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149675.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096338207644; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338207644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tropical bats","conservation of migratory bats","nonmigratory bats","beneficial aspects of migratory bats","migratory behavior of temperate","intercontinental migration","bat migration","maximum migration distances","genetic analyses","negative aspects","effective population sizes","stable isotope analyses","lower levels of population subdivision","special challenges","dispersal of pollen","tracking","banding","control of insect populations","short-distance migrators","seeds","broad areas","radio","current knowledge","hibernation","international efforts","satellite transmitters","variety of methods","close association","article","pathogens","birds","humans"],"language":"en"},

School absenteeism data have been employed as a component of influenza surveillance systems in some locations. Data timeliness and system acceptance remain as key determinants affecting the usefulness of a prospective surveillance system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic school absenteeism surveillance system using smart card\u2013based technology for influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance among a representative network of local primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. METHODS: We designed and implemented a surveillance system according to the Protocol for a Standardized information infrastructure for Pandemic and Emerging infectious disease Response (PROSPER). We employed an existing smart card\u2013based education and school administration platform for data capture, customized the user interface, and used additional back end systems built for other downstream surveillance steps. We invited local schools to participate and collected absenteeism data by the implemented system. We compared temporal trend of the absenteeism data with data from existing community sentinel and laboratory surveillance data. RESULTS: We designed and implemented an ILI surveillance system utilizing smart card\u2013based attendance tracking approach for data capture. We implemented the surveillance system in a total of 107 schools (including 66 primary schools and 41 secondary schools), covering a total of 75,052 children. The system successfully captured information on absences for 2 consecutive academic years (2012-2013 and 2013-2014). The absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community, with an upsurge in disease activity detected up to 1 to 2 weeks preceding other existing surveillance systems. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and implemented a novel smart card technology\u2013based school absenteeism surveillance system. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of building a large-scale surveillance system riding on a routinely adopted data collection approach and the use of simple system enhancement to minimize workload implication and enhance system acceptability. Data from this system have potential value in supplementing existing sentinel influenza surveillance for situational awareness of influenza activity in the community.","publish_time":"2017-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ip, Dennis KM; Lau, Eric HY; So, Hau Chi; Xiao, Jingyi; Lam, Chi Kin; Fang, Vicky J; Tam, Yat Hung; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5650675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986338/; https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.6810","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["ILI surveillance system","implemented system","prospective surveillance system","based school absenteeism surveillance system","laboratory surveillance data","electronic school absenteeism surveillance system","School absenteeism data","system acceptance","system acceptability","large-scale surveillance system riding","existing surveillance systems","data capture","Data timeliness","component of influenza surveillance systems","supplementing existing sentinel influenza surveillance","downstream surveillance steps","data collection approach","use of simple system enhancement","existing smart card","influenza virus","school settings","secondary schools","primary schools","local schools","based technology","existing community sentinel","School-aged children","ILI activity","novel smart card technology","school administration platform","based education","situational awareness of influenza activity","disease activity","based attendance tracking approach","end systems","feasibility","total","study","representative network of local primary","highest incidence of respiratory virus infections","Standardized information infrastructure","transmission of respiratory viruses","Emerging infectious disease Response","potential value","Pandemic","workload implication","key determinants","absences","major concern","usefulness","Protocol","illness","user interface","Hong Kong","consecutive academic years","temporal trend","BACKGROUND","upsurge","weeks","locations","OBJECTIVE","aim","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Infected individuals are able to travel to any country in the world within one day. In this study we combine these two insights to investigate the influence of climate change on pandemic spreading patterns of airborne infectious diseases, like influenza. Well-known recent examples for pandemics are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2002/2003) and H1N1 (Influenza A virus subtype, 2009), which have demonstrated the vulnerability of a strongly connected world. Methods Our study is based on a complex network approach including the following datasets: \u2013global air traffic data (from openflights.org) with information on airports, direct flight connections, and airplane types; \u2013global population grid [from Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), NASA]; \u2013WATCH-Forcing-Data-ERA-Interim (WFDEI) climate reanalysis data (1980\u20132015) and RCP6.0 climate projection data (2016\u20132040): temperature, specific humidity, surface air pressure, water vapour pressure. We use the dependency between water vapour pressure and influenza transmission rate to give every location around the globe a unique transmission rate time series from 1980 until 2040. Local disease development is simulated with a stochastic SEIR compartmental model. All individuals (including infectious ones) are able to migrate from location to location via air traffic to simulate global dissemination of the virus. Results Our results show which regions are most vulnerable to climate change in terms of influenza pandemics towards key target locations (defined by highest degree, highest population, highest betweenness centrality). Furthermore, we point out the influence of climate change on pandemics from 1980 until 2040. A significant trend in the pandemic rate of spreading can be seen on a global scale. Climate change causes an influenza pandemic to proceed 5 days slower (global average) in the year 2040 compared to the year 1980. This trend varies from country to country. For example, pandemics originating from Chad show an accelerated (6 days faster) spread. Conclusion The presented results focus on the effect that climate change has on spreading patterns of airborne infectious diseases. The change from 1980 until 2040 of important influencing variables like population distribution, varying air traffic, vaccine research, hygiene, and healthcare are neglected to separate the impact of climate change.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brenner, F.; Marwan, N.","journal":"Revue d\u0027\u00C9pid\u00E9miologie et de Sant\u00E9 Publique","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0398762018312136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0398762018312136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["openflights.org","Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center","NASA"],"locations":["Chad"],"keyphrases":["influence of climate change","impact of climate change","climate reanalysis data","climate projection data","global air traffic data","influenza transmission rate","terms of influenza pandemics","Introduction Airborne influenza virus transmission","highest population","global population grid","Socioeconomic Data","Data-ERA","global average","global dissemination","global scale","pandemic rate of spreading","country","surface air pressure","varying air traffic","patterns of airborne infectious diseases","water vapour pressure","population distribution","highest degree","infectious ones","virus subtype","presented results","study","year","world","unique transmission rate time series","highest betweenness centrality","days slower","significant trend","Infected individuals","following datasets","airplane types","severe acute respiratory syndrome","vaccine research","key target locations","direct flight connections","globe","Interim","WFDEI","Applications Center","specific humidity","important influencing variables","SARS","Well-known recent examples","information","SEDAC","hygiene","complex network approach","NASA","airports","healthcare","temperature","Chad","H1N1","stochastic SEIR compartmental model","dependency","effect","regions","Local disease development","WATCH","insights","RCP6","Conclusion","vulnerability","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Objectives Evaluate the relative performance of two commercial broad range systems for the detection of viral agents in clinical respiratory tract specimens from immunocompromised children. Study design A total of 176 patient samples were included in the analysis, representing only the first sample collected for each patient, and excluding failed reactions. Samples were de-identified and assayed in parallel using two different, broadly multiplexed PCR systems: ResPlex\u2122 II Panel v2.0 (ResPlex), Qiagen, Hilden, Germany and FilmArray\u00AE Respiratory Panel (FilmArray), Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT. Method comparison was based upon pair-wise concordance of results according to patient age, viral target and number of targets detected. Results The two systems showed an overall concordance, by patient, of 83.8% (p =0.0001). FilmArray detected at least one target in 68.8% of samples, while ResPlex detected at least one target in 56.8%. ResPlex failed to detect 20.7% of FilmArray positives, and FilmArray failed to detect 4% of ResPlex positives. The relative performance of each system (including which system detected a higher number of positive samples) varied when stratified by target viral pathogen. Conclusions Broadly multiplexed PCR is an effective means of detecting large numbers of clinically relevant respiratory viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayden, Randall T.; Gu, Zhengming; Rodriguez, Alicia; Tanioka, Lisa; Ying, Claire; Morgenstern, Markus; Bankowski, Matthew J.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36a6f516a94c3479fa3edf849a77e380812038f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108354.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653211005531; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653211005531; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.12.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Idaho Technology Inc.","ResPlex"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["viral target","patient samples","FilmArray positives","ResPlex positives","Respiratory Panel","relevant respiratory viral pathogens","multiplexed PCR systems","detection of viral respiratory tract infections","detection of viral agents","patient age","commercial systems capable","clinical respiratory tract specimens","commercial broad range systems","development of PCR","relative performance","higher number of positive samples","failed reactions","Panel v2","pair-wise concordance of results","number of targets","overall concordance","wide variety of pathogens","Idaho Technology","large numbers","Salt Lake City","Method comparison","effective means","immunocompromised children","Germany","Hilden","Abstract Background","Qiagen","Conclusions","total","analysis","Study","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and provided 24,782 weaned pups for use in 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (82%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs. paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam\u2019s strain explained more than the sire\u2019s strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam\u2019s strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background, and that litter size is largely determined by dam\u2019s strain rather than sire\u2019s strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains.","publish_time":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shorter, John R.; Maurizio, Paul L.; Bell, Timothy A.; Shaw, Ginger D.; Miller, Darla R.; Gooch, Terry J.; Spence, Jason S.; McMillan, Leonard; Valdar, William; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdf021cfe745daed338cce7eaa5e548581477ff4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6505174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30877080/; https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expected litter size","sire\u2019s strain effects","strain-specific effects","average litter size","dam\u2019s strain effects account","parental effects","paternal strain","phenotypic variance of litter size","epistatic effects","additive effects","strains WSB","founder strains","strains C57BL","surviving CC strains","explained variance","EiJ","parental sex","mean","weaned pups","Dams","overall contribution of parent","Collaborative Cross","substantial contribution","understanding of factors","reproductive ability","Reproductive success","sex ratio distortion","detectable effect of seasonality","extinct lines","Bayesian","NOD","CAST","failures","truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model","use","PhJ","PWK","genetic background","ShiLtJ","environmental sources","different published experiments","litters","heterosis","strong evidence","breeding successes","origin","mammals","total variation","diallel-mating scheme","month period","analysis","epistasis accounting","results"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. Methods Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. Results Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p = 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. Conclusion Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH.

Although it is a novel concept and may have some limitations, CTC may be a very cost-effective and resource-saving strategy in managing massive cases of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Peong Gang; Kim, Chang Hyup; Heo, Yoon; Kim, Tae Suk; Park, Chan Woo; Kim, Choong-Hyo","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae675f651ca9b8cdfbb1d98a702fc5b39e33d7e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131899.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242347/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e140","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Community Treatment Center","CTC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed patients","Korea","initial management of patients","largest CTC","limited hospital resources","confirmed cases","weeks","massive cases of COVID","novel institution","medical resources","novel concept","strategy","purpose","patient number","Community Treatment Center","cohort isolation","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","results","limitations","symptom aggravation","emerging infectious diseases","home","worldwide pandemic","total","complication"],"language":"en"},

Here, we study for the first time the immunogenicity profile of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine (vaccinia Tiantan, VTT strain) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) through mucosal vaccination, which is noninvasive and has a critical implication for massive vaccination programs. Four different routes of vaccination were tested in parallel including intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), oral (i.o.), and subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculations in mice. We found that one time vaccination with an optimal dose of VTT was able to induce anti-VTT Nabs via each of the four routes. Higher levels of antiviral Nabs, however, were induced via the i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the i.m. and s.c. routes. Moreover, the i.n. and i.o. vaccinations also induced higher sustained levels of Nabs overtime, which conferred better protections against homologous or alternating mucosal routes of viral challenges six months post vaccination. The VTT-induced immunity via all four routes, however, was partially effective against the intramuscular viral challenge. Our data have implications for understanding the potential application of mucosal smallpox vaccination and for developing VTT-based vaccines to overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity.","publish_time":"2011-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Bin; Yu, Wenbo; Huang, Xiaoxing; Wang, Haibo; Liu, Li; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"J Biomed Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c59d9e3c66ccee9b1e671f475954e581af7a320.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3134386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21765641/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/970424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal vaccination","time vaccination","different routes of vaccination","VTT-induced immunity","VTT strain","anti-VTT","potential application of mucosal smallpox vaccination","mucosal routes of viral challenges","VTT-based vaccines","months post vaccination","massive vaccination programs","optimal dose of VTT","inoculations","causative agent of smallpox","intramuscular viral challenge","higher sustained levels","Higher levels of antiviral","replication-competent smallpox vaccine","immunogenicity profiles of existing vaccines","preexisting antivaccinia immunity","variola virus","vaccinia Tiantan","overtime","critical implication","better protections","neutralizing antibodies","possible bioterrorism threat","implications","vaccinations","data","mice"],"language":"en"},

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables the unbiased detection of all potential pathogens in a clinical sample, including variants and even unknown pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, there is a need for sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections, with single tube DNA and RNA sample-pre-treatment and potential for automated pan-pathogen detection was studied. Materials and Methods The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis was designed and optimized including the optimal concentration of the spike-in internal controls equine arteritis virus (EAV) and phocine-herpes virus-1 (PhHV-1).The whole genome of PhHV-1 was sequenced and added to the NCBI database. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using a selection of 25 respiratory samples with in total 29 positive and 346 negative PCR results, previously sent to the lab for routine diagnostics. Results The results demonstrated that our protocol using Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencing with 10 million reads showed high repeatability. The NCBI RefSeq database as opposed to the NCBI nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of virus classification. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value, demonstrating the semi-quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. The results as obtained by mNGS appeared condordant with PCR based diagnostics in 25 out of the 29 (86%) respiratory viruses positive by PCR and in 315 of 346 (91%) PCR-negative results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, and cytomegalovirus. Conclusions Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol was comparable with PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. All potential viral pathogens were detected in one single test, while it simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses.","publish_time":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Boheemen, Sander; van Rijn-Klink, Anneloes L.; Pappas, Nikos; Carbo, Ellen C.; Vorderman, Ruben H.P.; van \u0060t Hof, Peter J.; Mei, Hailiang; Claas, Eric C.J.; Kroes, Aloys C.M.; de Vries, Jutte J.C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92eaf4a156d3f39cc820260dadba37f1af280dc5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/492835","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral diagnostics","PCR target viral pathogens","potential viral pathogens","negative PCR results","PCR-negative results","in-house mNGS protocol","sequencing protocol","potential pathogens","routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections","detected viruses","respiratory viruses positive","DNA viruses","NCBI database","unknown pathogens","semi-quantitative nature of viral detection","respiratory samples","unbiased detection","PCR cycle threshold value","Introduction Viruses","simultaneous detection of RNA","NCBI nucleotide database","NCBI RefSeq database","generation sequencing","main cause of respiratory tract infections","enhanced specificity of virus classification","automated pan-pathogen detection","single tube DNA","routine diagnostic workflow","phocine-herpes virus","RNA sample-pre-treatment","analytical specificity","clinical sample","single test","genome of PhHV","internal controls equine arteritis virus","EAV","influenza C","spike","read counts","KI polyomavirus","Methods","need","variants","bioinformatics analysis","performance","condordant","Conclusions Sensitivity","detailed information","Illumina Nextseq","cytomegalovirus","Materials","Metagenomic","selection","lab","optimal concentration","correlation","study","high repeatability"],"language":"en"},

This study demonstrated that the sero-type 3 reovirus strain Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) could transiently activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 cells at earlier time points of infection. The blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased viral RNA synthesis and yield. The role of the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt in regulating reovirus replication was further analyzed. We found that during reovirus infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2) was increased and the expression of p53 was reduced. In addition, the blockage of PI3K/Akt by Ly294002 or knockdown of Akt by siRNA reduced the level of p-MDM2 and increased the level of p53. Both indicated that the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated. Pre-treatment with Nutlin, which can destroy MDM2 and p53 cross-talk and increase the expression of p53 RNA and protein, dose-dependently enhanced reovirus replication. Additionally, the overexpression of p53 alone also supported reovirus replication, and knockdown of p53 significantly inhibited viral replication. This study demonstrates that PI3K/Akt/p53 activated by mammalian reovirus can serve as a pathway for inhibiting virus replication/infection, yet the precise mechanism of this process remains under further investigation.","publish_time":"2015-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaozhan; Wu, Hongxia; Liu, Chunguo; Tian, Jin; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6095a04fde33482975d02a46069943568b11ebe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106092.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134815002403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26066464/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134815002403","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p53 of PI3K","level of p53","Akt pathway","knockdown of p53","knockdown of Akt","p53 cross","overexpression of p53","Akt activation","blockage of PI3K","reovirus infection","viral replication","enhanced reovirus replication","expression of p53 RNA","p-MDM2","mammalian reovirus","level of phosphorylated MDM2","downstream effectors MDM2","modulating virus replication","inhibiting virus replication","viral RNA synthesis","Viral infections","study","earlier time points of infection","central role","A549 cells","protein","dose","Masked Palm Civet","Ly294002","China","sero-type","siRNA","host","pathways","phosphatidylinositol","yield","kinase","precise mechanism","process","MPC","Nutlin","addition","Pre-treatment","investigation"],"language":"en"},

This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc \u03B3 receptor (Fc\u03B3R). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-Fc\u03B3R monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine Fc\u03B3R. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the Fc\u03B3R mediates this activity.

In contrast, non-fatal suicidal behaviour declines with age and more closely resembles suicide than in younger age groups. There are difficulties in the detection and determination of pathological suicidal ideation in older people. Multiple factors increase suicide risk ranging from distal early and mid-life issues such as child abuse, parental death, substance misuse and traumatic life experiences to proximal precipitants in late life such as social isolation and health-related concerns. Clinical depression is the most frequently identified proximal mental health concern and in many cases is a first episode of major depression. Recent studies have identified changes on neuroimaging and neurocognitive factors that might distinguish suicidal from non-suicidal depression in older people. Strategies for suicide prevention need to be \u2018whole of life\u2019 and, as no single prevention strategy is likely to be successful alone, a multi-faceted, multi-layered approach is required. This should include optimal detection and management of depression and of high risk individuals as available evidence indicates that this can reduce suicidal behaviour.

Furthermore, the ability of PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to detect enteroviruses and rhinoviruses in respiratory samples has not been well evaluated. We sought to use PCR/ESI-MS to comprehensively investigate the viral epidemiology of adult RTIs, including testing for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs from 267 adults with acute RTIs (212 upper RTIs and 55 lower RTIs) who visited a local clinic or the outpatient or emergency departments of a medical center in Taiwan between October 2012 and June 2013 were tested for respiratory viruses by both virus isolation and PCR/ESI-MS. Throat swabs from 15 patients with bacterial infections and 27 individuals without active infections were included as control samples. Respiratory viruses were found in 23.6%, 47.2%, and 47.9% of the 267 cases by virus isolation, PCR/ESI-MS, and both methods, respectively. When both methods were used, the influenza A virus (24.3%) and rhinoviruses (9.4%) were the most frequently identified viruses, whereas human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), enteroviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses were identified in small proportions of cases (\u003C5% of cases for each type of virus). Coinfection was observed in 4.1% of cases. In the control group, only 1 (2.4%) sample tested positive for a respiratory virus by PCR/ESI-MS. Patients who were undergoing steroid treatment, had an active malignancy, or suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were at risk for rhinovirus, hMPV, or parainfluenza infections, respectively. Overall, immunocompromised patients, patients with COPD, and patients receiving dialysis were at risk for noninfluenza respiratory virus infection. Rhinoviruses (12.7%), influenza A virus (10.9%), and parainfluenza viruses (7.3%) were the most common viruses involved in the 55 cases of lower RTIs. The factors of parainfluenza infection, old age, and immunosuppression were independently associated with lower RTIs. In conclusion, PCR/ESI-MS improved the diagnostic yield for viral RTIs. Non-influenza respiratory virus infections were associated with patients with comorbidities and with lower RTIs. Additional studies that delineate the clinical need for including non-influenza respiratory viruses in the diagnostic work-up in these populations are warranted.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shih, Hsin-I; Wang, Hsuan-Chen; Su, Ih-Jen; Hsu, Hsiang-Chin; Wang, Jen-Ren; Sun, Hsiao Fang Sunny; Chou, Chien-Hsuan; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsieh, Ming-I; Wu, Chi-Jung","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef6361c7bffb9e92f397d7004bfb3a9c804d7c6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4635751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402811/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000001545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus","viral RTIs","cases of lower RTIs","Non-influenza respiratory virus infections","respiratory samples","non-influenza respiratory viruses","virus isolation","parainfluenza viruses","noninfluenza respiratory virus infection","ESI-MS","acute RTIs","upper RTIs","type of virus","parainfluenza infections","identified viruses","ability of PCR","common viruses","rhinoviruses","Viral etiologies of respiratory tract infections","viral epidemiology of adult RTIs","active infections","immunocompromised patients","bacterial infections","enteroviruses","factors of parainfluenza infection","small proportions of cases","COPD","hMPV","risk","throat swabs","control samples","methods","human coronaviruses","human metapneumovirus","diagnostic work","diagnostic yield","active malignancy","pediatric populations","control group","electrospray ionization mass spectrometry","clinical need","emergency departments","adults","outpatient","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","old age","local clinic","immunosuppression","dialysis","testing","individuals","adenoviruses","medical center","steroid treatment","comorbidities","Taiwan","Additional studies","conclusion","Coinfection"],"language":"en"},

While C6-aryl substituted purine nucleosides were found to be weakly active, several C7-substituted 7-deazapurine nucleosides elicited potent antiproliferative activity. Their activity spectrum was evaluated in the NCI-60 tumor cell line panel indicating activity against several solid tumor derived cell lines.

These results highlight the potential advantages of recombining known sugar and nucleobase motifs as a library design strategy to discover novel antiviral or antitumor agents.","publish_time":"2018-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hulpia, Fabian; Noppen, Sam; Schols, Dominique; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert; Liekens, Sandra; Vervaeke, Peter; Van Calenbergh, Serge","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a55db95f2f8b19bdbdd94b66fcbe008f8b661add.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111280.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523418306275; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.07.062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523418306275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Analog","BLI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interesting activity","tumor cell proliferation","tumor growth","activity spectrum","tumor cell line panel","metastatic breast tumor","potent antiproliferative activity","solid tumor derived cell lines","deazapurine nucleosides","resulting nucleosides","dideazanucleoside analog","library design strategy","focused nucleoside library","modified purine nucleobases","d-ribofuranose sugar scaffold","panel of relevant human viruses","nucleobase motifs","novel antiviral","NCI","MDA-MB","potential advantages of recombining","ability","formation of lung metastases","LM2","yl base","C-ethynyl","C7","amino-purin","antitumor agents","chloro","BLI analysis","results","C6-aryl","hCMV","xenograft model"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we addressed the role of IL-17A during allergic asthma and antiviral immune response in human and murine immunocompetent cells. In this study we found that asthmatic children with a RV infection in their upper airways have upregulated mRNA levels of the antiviral cytokine interferon type I (IFN)-\u03B2 and the transcription factor T-box 21 (TBX21) and reduced levels of IL-17A protein in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also found that IL-17A inhibited RV1b replication in infected human lung epithelial cells A549. Furthermore, by using gene array analysis we discovered that targeted deletion of Il17a in murine lung CD4(\u002B) T cells impaired Oas1g mRNA downstream of Ifn\u03B2, independently from RV infection. Additionally, in PBMCs of children with a RV infection in their nasalpharyngeal fluid OAS1 gene expression was found downregulated. Finally RV1b inhibited IL-17A production in lung CD4(\u002B) T cells in a setting of experimental asthma. These results indicate that the RV1b inhibits IL-17A in T helper type 17 cells and IL-17A clears RV1b infection in epithelial cells. In both cases IL-17A contributes to fend off RV1b infection by inducing genes downstream of interferon type I pathway.

Some viruses have genomes with relatively short poly(A) tails (encephalomyocarditis virus) whereas others have genomes with longer poly(A) tails (polioviruses and rhinoviruses). Here we review the polyadenylation of picornavirus RNA as it relates to the structure and function of 3D(pol). Poliovirus 3D(pol) uses template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms as it replicates the poly(A) tails of viral RNA (Steil et al., 2010). These mechanisms are analogous to those involved in the polyadenylation of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus mRNAs. 3D(pol) residues intimately associated with viral RNA templates and products regulate the size of poly(A) tails in viral RNA (Kempf et al., 2013). Consistent with their ancient evolutionary origins, picornavirus 3D(pol) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) share structural and functional features. Structurally, both 3D(pol) and TERT assume a \u201Cright-hand\u201D conformation with thumb, palm and fingers domains encircling templates and products. Functionally, both 3D(pol) and TERT use template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms to synthesize repetitive sequences: poly(A) tails in the case of picornavirus RNA genomes and DNA telomeres in the case of eukaryotic chromosomes. Thus, picornaviruses and their eukaryotic hosts (humans \u0026 animals) maintain the 3\u2019 ends of their respective genomes via evolutionarily related mechanisms.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kempf, Brian J; Barton, David J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9761a7769d24a9c051f0b5327b5db54e9161fef1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1735d918984252bfb2ef6e6615c9f1b5d8cebac6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4801031.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4801031?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.12.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214005449; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214005449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Poly"],"organizations":["TERT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tails of viral RNA","case of picornavirus RNA genomes","polyadenylation of picornavirus RNA","viral RNA templates","size of poly","short poly","longer poly","respective genomes","related mechanisms","TERT use template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms","encephalomyocarditis virus","products","polyadenylation of vesicular stomatitis virus","influenza virus mRNAs","case of eukaryotic chromosomes","important features","eukaryotic hosts","functional features","DNA telomeres","palm","repetitive sequences","fingers domains","ancient evolutionary origins","telomerase reverse transcriptase","thumb","conformation","residues","humans","picornaviruses","animals","polioviruses","structure","Steil","Kempf","rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

We previously reported that the Onchocerca volvulus recombinant protein rOv-ASP-1 can induce activation and maturation of na\u00EFve human DCs and therefore could be used as an innate adjuvant to promote balanced Th1 and Th2 responses to bystander vaccine antigens in mice. With a few vaccine antigens, it also promoted a Th1-biased response based on pronounced induction of Th1-associated IgG2a and IgG2b antibody responses and the upregulated production of Th1 cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6. However, because it is a protein, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant may also induce anti-self-antibodies. Therefore, it was important to verify that the host responses to self will not affect the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 when it is used in subsequent vaccinations with the same or different vaccine antigens. In this study, we have established rOv-ASP-1\u0027s adjuvanticity in mice during the course of two sequential vaccinations using two vaccine model systems: the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike protein and a commercial influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine comprised of three virus strains. Moreover, the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 was retained with an efficacy similar to that obtained when it was used for a first vaccination, even though a high level of anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibodies was present in the sera of mice before the administration of the second vaccine. To further demonstrate its utility as an adjuvant for human use, we also immunized non-human primates (NHPs) with RBD plus rOv-ASP-1 and showed that rOv-ASP-1 could induce high titres of functional and protective anti-RBD antibody responses in NHPs. Notably, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant did not induce high titer antibodies against self in NHPs. Thus, the present study provided a sound scientific foundation for future strategies in the development of this novel protein adjuvant.","publish_time":"2012-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jing; Tricoche, Nancy; Du, Lanying; Hunter, Meredith; Zhan, Bin; Goud, Gaddam; Didier, Elizabeth S.; Liu, Jing; Lu, Lu; Marx, Preston A.; Jiang, Shibo; Lustigman, Sara","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eff3310317521aed7abe06ef1fa9963ca9d6caf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3355165.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adjuvanticity of rOv","high level of anti-rOv-ASP","Onchocerca volvulus recombinant protein rOv-ASP","vaccine effectiveness","bystander vaccine antigens","different vaccine antigens","novel protein adjuvant","Th2 responses","protective anti-RBD antibody responses","host responses","NHPs","vaccine model systems","innate adjuvant","IgG2b antibody responses","balanced Th1","high titer antibodies","anti-self-antibodies","pronounced induction of Th1","antigen-specific protective immune responses","Th1-biased response","human use","sera of mice","s adjuvanticity","present study","upregulated production of Th1 cytokines","SARS-CoV spike protein","high titres of functional","non-human primates","sequential vaccinations","maturation of na\u00EFve human DCs","virus strains","subsequent vaccinations","commercial influenza virus hemagglutinin","associated IgG2a","sound scientific foundation","development","HA","receptor-binding domain","future strategies","key elements","course","activation","IFN-\u03B3","TNF-\u03B1","Adjuvants","utility","administration","efficacy similar"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The MENA Influenza Stakeholder Network (MENA-ISN) was set-up with the aim of increasing seasonal influenza vaccination coverage by (i) enhancing evidence-based exchanges, and (ii) increasing awareness on the safety and benefits of seasonal vaccination. During the 7th MENA-ISN meeting, representatives from 8 countries presented their influenza surveillance, vaccination coverage and actions achieved and provided a list of country objectives for the upcoming 3 years. RESULTS: MENA-ISN countries share the goal to reduce influenza related morbidity and mortality. Participants admitted that lack of knowledge about influenza, its consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality and economy are the major barrier to attaining higher influenza vaccination coverage in their countries. The cost of the vaccine is another key barrier that could contribute to low vaccination coverage. Participants drew a list of strategic interventions to bridge gaps in the knowledge of influenza burden in this region. CONCLUSIONS: Participating countries concluded that despite an increase in vaccine uptake observed during the last few years, influenza vaccination coverage remains relatively low. Priority areas should be identified and action plans tailored to each country situation set-up to investigate the best way to move forward.","publish_time":"2018-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Awaidi, Salah; Abusrewil, Suleiman; AbuHasan, Muslim; Akcay, Meral; Aksakal, Fatma N.B.; Bashir, Uzma; Elahmer, Omar; Esteghamati, Abdoulreza; Gahwagi, Milad; Mirza, Yusuf K.; Grasso, Cindy; Kassianos, George; Khris, Moulud; Mardani, Masoud; Maltezou, Helena; Nourlil, Jalal; Oumzil, Hicham; Osterhaus, Ab; Picot, Valentina; Pehlivan, Tamer; Saadatian-Elahi, Mitra; Tali, \u0130lham; Tarraf, Hesham; Ugur, Baris; Zaraket, Hassan","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f04da1beea21e9dd875c538d442c8726ca7187c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102733.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034118301072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034118301072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.07.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MENA Influenza Stakeholder Network"],"locations":["Middle East","North Africa"],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","influenza surveillance","seasonal influenza vaccination coverage","higher influenza vaccination coverage","knowledge of influenza burden","influenza related morbidity","MENA Influenza Stakeholder Network","low vaccination coverage","MENA-ISN countries","severe zoonotic influenza outbreaks episodes","MENA-ISN meeting","benefits of seasonal vaccination","circulation of Northern Hemisphere human influenza viruses","Participating countries","mortality","region","years","Participants","country situation set-up","list of country objectives","major barrier","key barrier","terms of morbidity","lack of knowledge","vaccine uptake","list of strategic interventions","regard","gaps","dual challenge","goal","aim","North Africa","action plans","Middle East","pilgrims","economy","consequences","actions","representatives","increase","safety","METHODS","best way","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Priority areas","evidence-based exchanges","awareness","cost","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Subsequently, because of passive antibody transfer, the offspring of these primed gilts were more efficient in surviving a lethal TGEV challenge. An average survival rate of 89% occurred in 6 litters of piglets from primed gilts that were boosted with 2.8\u00D7106 plaque forming units (PFU) of TGEV whereas 76% of the piglets survived in three litters that suckled primed gilts boosted with 3.0\u00D7105 PFU of TGEV. Non-primed gilts given identical pre-farrowing doses of TGEV had litter survival rates of 63 and 55%, respectively. Moreover, both groups of litters from primed gilts suffered less clinical illness (as measured by the extent of weight loss post-challenge) than control litters. Priming of the piglets as neonates and boosting the pregnant gilts produced an anamnestic systemic immune response and correspondingly higher milk titers in the primed gilts compared to control animals. Thus, priming piglets with PRCV was beneficial in providing resistance to TGEV and could be incorporated into a vaccine strategy that yields better protection against TGEV.","publish_time":"2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wesley, Ronald D.; Lager, Kelly M.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dad34bdfec9d9f26b490e1378374cd5c11b52d67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117301.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113503001500; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113503001500","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRCV","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Non-primed gilts","litters of piglets","PFU of TGEV","pregnant gilts","priming piglets","lethal TGEV challenge","female piglets","control litters","limiting dose of virulent TGEV","groups of litters","identical pre-farrowing doses of TGEV","PRCV","secondary immune response","anamnestic systemic immune response","control animals","litter survival rates","average survival rate","extent of weight loss post-challenge","higher milk titers","young age","offspring","immunological memory","Abstract","better protection","clinical illness","vaccine strategy","passive antibody transfer","units","resistance","neonates","plaque","days"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions.

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of HBoV viral load on clinical characteristics in children who were HBoV positive and suffered severe LRTI. METHODS: Lower respiratory tract aspirates from 186 hospitalized children with severe LRTI were obtained by bronchoscopy. HBoVs were detected by real-time PCR and other 10 infectious agents were examined using PCR and/or direct fluorescent assay. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (24.6%) were tested positive for HBoV in the respiratory tract aspirates. Fifteen samples had a high viral load (\u003E10(4) copies/mL) and the other sixteen samples had a low viral load (\u003C10(4) copies/mL). The duration of presented wheezing and hospitalization was longer in children with high viral load of HBoV than that in children with low viral load. The days of wheezing showed a correlation with viral load of HBoV. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that HBoV was frequently detected in patients with severe LRTI. Wheezing was one of the most common symptoms presented by patients with positive HBoV. A high HBoV viral load could be an etiologic agent for LRTI, which led to more severe lower respiratory tract symptom, longer duration of wheezing and hospitalization.","publish_time":"2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Yu; Gu, Xiaoyang; Zhao, Xiaodong; Luo, Jian; Luo, Zhengxiu; Wang, Lijia; Fu, Zhou; Yang, Xiqiang; Liu, Enmei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae072e0f04db143d038aa090e714f31e0c8c34bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3316689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22479609/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034353","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high viral load of HBoV","high HBoV viral load","impact of HBoV viral load","HBoV positive","positive HBoV","low viral load","severe LRTI","Lower respiratory tract aspirates","severe lower respiratory tract symptom","lower respiratory tract infection","patients","longer duration of wheezing","duration of presented wheezing","hospitalized children","days of wheezing","etiologic agent","hospitalization","copies","real-time PCR","sixteen samples","clinical characteristics","role","correlation","evidences","infectious agents","discovered parvovirus","common symptoms","METHODS","direct fluorescent assay","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","study","HBoVs","bronchoscopy","objective","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Only a few amino-acid changes in the S1 subunit of wild-type IBVS proteins may result in mutants unaffected by current vaccines. METHODS: Partial S1 gene sequences of 3 IBV isolates of the Moroccan Italy 02 genotype from vaccinated and unvaccinated broiler chicken flocks, located in southern and central regions of Morocco, were amplified by RT-PCR, sequenced, and aligned for phylogenetic and amino-acid similarity analyses. RESULTS: The three isolates were found genetically highly distant from known avian IBV based on partial sequences of their S1 genes: gammaCoV/chicken/Morocco/I01/2011(IBV/Morocco/01), gammaCoV/chicken/Morocco/I30/2010 (IBV/Morocco/30), and gammaCoV/chicken/Morocco/I38/2013 (IBV/Morocco/38), nucleotide sequence identities reached 89.5 % to 90.9 % among the three isolates. The deduced protein sequence identities ranged from 29.7 % (between IBV/Morocco/38 and Egypt SCU-14/2013-1) to 78.2 % (between IBV/Morocco/01 and Spain/05/866). Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated the emergence of a new Moroccan genotype, clustering with regionally related isolates from Spain (Spain/05/866) and belonging to a new sub-genotype. CONCLUSION: Our sequencing results demonstrate a co-circulation of wild-type infectious bronchitis viruses in broiler chickens.

For clinical applications, some key challenges remain, such as the long turnaround time and relatively high cost of deep sequencing for pathogen identification and characterization and the lack of international standardization in immune repertoire analysis.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burkholder, William F.; Newell, Evan W.; Poidinger, Michael; Chen, Swaine; Fink, Katja","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39e066c95d89964b9cd608c14fc5e2077706e72e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5451494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620372/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00593","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pathogen Repertoires"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["high cost of deep sequencing","Pathogen Repertoires","high-throughput sequencing","potential of deep sequencing technology","pathogen identification","Improvement of Patient Outcomes","immune repertoire analysis","improvement of patient diagnosis","key international players","allied technologies","inaugural workshop","key challenges","clinician-scientists","lack of international standardization","Singapore-based researchers","broad public health outcomes","Infectious Diseases","characterization","field","treatment","host","bioinformatics","clinicians","long turnaround time","latest trends","coevolution of adaptive immunity","prognosis","interplay","pathogens","clinical applications","focus","presentations","aim"],"language":"en"},

Bacterial growth medium filtrate (BGMF) of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 and its bacterial cell suspension (BCS) were evaluated separately for their antiviral activity against FCV grown in Crandell\u2013Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. No significant antiviral effect was seen when CRFK cells were pre-treated with either BGMF (raw or pH 7-adjusted BGMF) or BCS. However, pre-treatment of FCV with BGMF and BCS resulted in a reduction in virus titers of 1.3 log(10) tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)(50) and 1.8 log(10) TCID(50), respectively. The highest reductions in FCV infectivity were obtained when CRFK cells were co-treated with FCV and pH 7-adjusted BGMF or with FCV and BCS (7.5 log(10) TCID(50) and 6.0 log(10) TCID(50), respectively).

We propose a model in which aging-related changes in specific brain structures increase the propensity for the development of certain psychiatric syndromes. The predisposing factors are distinct from the mechanisms mediating the expression of a syndromic state, much like hypertension is distinct from stroke, but constitutes a morbid vulnerability. We argue that research seeking to identify both brain abnormalities conferring vulnerability as well as the mediating mechanisms of symptomatology has the potential to lead to a medical classification of psychiatric disorders. In addition, a medical classification can guide the effort to improve treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders as it can direct therapeutic efforts to the underlying predisposing abnormalities, the syndrome-mediating mechanisms, and to development of behavioral skills needed for coping with adversity and disability.","publish_time":"2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexopoulos, George S.; Schultz, Susan K.; Lebowitz, Barry D.","journal":"Biological Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/034cbfbe1e5d2d19395bd739353a4ac4502553ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124284.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006322305005780; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322305005780","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical classification of psychiatric disorders","Geriatric psychiatric syndromes","prevention of psychiatric disorders","development of certain psychiatric syndromes","specific brain abnormalities","Geriatric syndromes","syndrome-mediating mechanisms","mediating mechanisms of symptomatology","underlying predisposing abnormalities","specific brain structures","predisposing factors","morbid vulnerability","development of behavioral skills","neuroimaging features","propensity","therapeutic efforts","related changes","potential","starting point","neurological comorbidity","hypertension","syndromic state","stroke","expression","treatment","adversity","complex behaviors","single lesions","model","research","addition","disability"],"language":"en"},

The characteristics of recognition, self\u2010assembly and ease of genetic manipulation make inorganic binding peptides an ideal molecular tool for site\u2010specific enzyme immobilization. Herein, we demonstrate the utilization of gold binding peptide (GBP1) as a molecular linker genetically fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) and immobilized on gold substrate. Multiple tandem repeats (n = 5, 6, 7, 9) of gold binding peptide were fused to N\u2010terminus of AP (nGBP1\u2010AP) and the enzymes were expressed in E. coli cells. The binding and enzymatic activities of the bi\u2010functional fusion constructs were analyzed using quartz crystal microbalance spectroscopy and biochemical assays. Among the multiple\u2010repeat constructs, 5GBP1\u2010AP displayed the best bi\u2010functional activity and, therefore, was chosen for self\u2010immobilization studies. Adsorption and assembly properties of the fusion enzyme, 5GBP1\u2010AP, were studied via surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. We demonstrated self\u2010immobilization of the bi\u2010functional enzyme on micro\u2010patterned substrates where genetically linked 5GBP1\u2010AP displayed higher enzymatic activity per area compared to that of AP. Our results demonstrate the promising use of inorganic binding peptides as site\u2010specific molecular linkers for oriented enzyme immobilization with retained activity. Directed assembly of proteins on solids using genetically fused specific inorganic\u2010binding peptides has a potential utility in a wide range of biosensing and bioconversion processes. Biotechnol.

This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into nsp12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Ward, Andrew B.","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fd0972f4d5eb0e4c7ec68efad48fc01a1f547c2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/50c63f3bfae37dbb495ef4d69b0d68c5c42b49ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6538669.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10280-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase","nsp12 polymerase catalysis","viral polymerases","viral genome","nsp8 co-factors","essential co-factors","multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins","MERS-CoV","pathogenic coronaviruses","coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery","\u00C5 resolution structure","key insights","acts","fidelity","nsp7","template","single particle cryo-electron microscopy","replication","large N-terminal extension","kinase","design of novel antiviral therapeutics","emergence","infecting host cells","transcription","assembly","architecture common","fold","human circulation","Recent history"],"language":"en"},

Sorting of secreted proteins from the Golgi apparatus has been a topic of interest for over thirty years, yet there is still no clear understanding of the machinery that forms the post-Golgi carriers. Most evidence points to these post-Golgi carriers being tubular pleomorphic structures that bud from the trans-face of the Golgi. In this review, we present the background studies and highlight the key components of this pathway, we then discuss the machinery implicated in the formation of these carriers, their translocation across the cytosol, and their fusion at the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stalder, Dani\u00E8le; Gershlick, David C.","journal":"Semin Cell Dev Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00154ef181732195c77fc1abd791fa2a996b9099.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152905.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952119301302?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317144/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1084952119301302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Golgi apparatus","post-Golgi carriers","Sorting of secreted proteins","proteins sort","machinery","protein sorting","different cellular destinations","endolysosomal system","trafficking","tubular pleomorphic structures","regulated mechanism important","endoplasmic reticulum","background studies","key components","physiological events","Abstract","eukaryotic cells","trans-face","fusion","extracellular space","synthesis","pathway","cytosol","translocation","formation","topic","evidence","plasma membrane","review","clear understanding","cell surface","years"],"language":"en"},

We have proposed a panel of selected marker genes, which correspond with the phenotype of oviduct cells of a laying hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) and quail (Coturnix japonica). We demonstrated differences in characteristics of those cells, in tissue and in vitro, with respect to different anatomical and functional parts of the oviduct (infundibulum (INF), distal magnum (DM, and proximal magnum (PM)). The following gene expression signatures were studied: (1) oviduct markers (estrogen receptor 1, ovalbumin, and SPINK7 - ovomucoid), (2) epithelial markers (keratin 5, keratin 14, and occludin) and (3) stem-like/progenitor markers (CD44 glycoprotein, LGR5, Musashi-1, and sex determining region Y-box 9, Nanog homebox, OCT4/cPOUV gene encoding transcription factor POU5F3). RESULTS: In chicken, the expression of oviduct markers increased toward the proximal oviduct. Epithelial markers keratin14 and occludin were high in distal oviduct and decreased toward the proximal magnum. In quail oviduct tissue, the gene expression pattern of oviduct/epithelial markers was similar to chicken. The markers of progenitors/stemness in hen oviduct (Musashi-1 and CD44 glycoprotein) had the highest relative expression in the infundibulum and decreased toward the proximal magnum. In quail, we found significant expression of four progenitor markers (LGR5 gene, SRY sex determining region Y-box 9, OCT4/cPOUV gene, and CD44 glycoprotein) that were largely present in the distal oviduct. After in vitro culture of oviduct cells, the gene expression pattern has changed. High secretive potential of magnum-derived cells diminished by using decreased abundance of mRNA. On the other hand, chicken oviduct cells originating from the infundibulum gained ability to express OVM and OVAL. Epithelial character of the cells was maintained in vitro. Among progenitor markers, both hen and quail cells expressed high level of SOX9, LGR5 and Musashi-1. CONCLUSION: Analysis of tissue material revealed gradual increase/decrease pattern in majority of the oviduct markers in both species. This pattern changed after the oviductal cells have been cultured in vitro. The results can provide molecular tools to validate the phenotype of in vitro biological models from reproductive tissue.

In this study, hesperetin was used in a crayfish pathogen challenge to discover its effects on the innate immune system of invertebrates. The crayfish Procambarus clarkii was used as an experimental model and challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Pathogen challenge experiments showed that hesperetin treatment significantly reduced the mortality caused by WSSV infection, while the VP28 copies of WSSV were also reduced. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed that hesperetin increased the expression of several innate immune-related genes, including NF-kappaB and C-type lectin. Further analysis showed that hesperetin treatment plays a positive effects on three immune parameters like total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activity. Nevertheless, whether or not infected with WSSV, hesperetin treatment would significantly increase the hemocyte apoptosis rates in crayfish. These results indicated that hesperetin could regulate the innate immunity of crayfish, and delaying and reducing the mortality after WSSV challenge. Therefore, the present study provided novel insights into the potential therapeutic or preventive functions associated with hesperetin to regulate crayfish immunity and protect crayfish against WSSV infection, provide certain theoretical basis for production practice.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Xiyi; Zhu, Fei","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bfa39364d31a938dc135d26f55e9f73db56449c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111725.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464819307387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302287/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464819307387; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.07.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WSSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hesperetin treatment","Abstract Hesperetin","WSSV challenge","WSSV infection","crayfish immunity","innate immunity of crayfish","crayfish pathogen challenge","VP28 copies of WSSV","crayfish Procambarus clarkii","immune parameters","innate immune-related genes","innate immune system of invertebrates","Pathogen challenge experiments","mortality","positive effects","potential antiviral","present study","total hemocyte count","hemocyte apoptosis rates","phenoloxidase","certain theoretical basis","NF-kappaB","Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","novel insights","white spot syndrome virus","experimental model","superoxide dismutase activity","preventive functions","expression","natural flavanone compound","production practice","C-type lectin","anticancer activities","oranges","lemons","analysis","results"],"language":"en"},

In response, we developed a nurse-led program to screen and triage patients with MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: A formal educational program was implemented to ensure a standardized approach to care planning and delivery. The essential skills that were included were the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, gloves, head cover and N95 mask, hand hygiene, the practice of donning and doffing and the collection of MERS-CoV nasopharyngeal specimens. RESULTS: A core group of nurses were identified from high-risk units. The education program consisted of four skill-days. Nurses were assigned a pre-course work from Mosby\u2019s Nursing Skills, an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and the process for obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab. The skill lab incorporated multiple methods such group discussion, watching an on-line video, and a simulated demonstration and practice on a mannequin. In total, 450 nurses attended the Nasopharyngeal Skills Day and 1000 nurses received training. Donning and doffing PPE and N95 mask fit testing has become an annual mandatory competency requirement for staff in nursing and clinical services. CONCLUSION: The application of specified protocols minimizes the risks of cross infection, placing emphasis on patient and staff safety as well as expediting the patient to definitive treatment. Nurse educators have an instrumental role in training nurses and other healthcare providers on the specifics needed to identify, contain and manage patient presenting with MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2017-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Rothwell, Siobhan; Mcgregor, Heather A.; Khouri, Zeina A.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e57b5aa4cea0493a7204ed28bdaf1d58ea37485.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28869153/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117302071; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2017.08.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117302071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","Nasopharyngeal Skills"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["training nurses","MERS-CoV infection","doffing PPE","core group of nurses","CoV nasopharyngeal specimens","collection of MERS","practice of donning","Nasopharyngeal Skills Day","Mosby\u2019s Nursing Skills","multiple methods","skill lab","essential skills","skill-days","nasopharyngeal swab","education program","online skill module","formal educational program","N95 mask fit testing","group discussion","staff safety","healthcare providers","multiple healthcare associated outbreaks","Nurse educators","risks of cross infection","annual mandatory competency requirement","head cover","hand hygiene","Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","gown","emphasis","gloves","pre-course work","instrumental role","emergence","application of specified protocols","simulated demonstration","on-line video","triage patients","use of Personal Protective Equipment","standardized approach","care planning","delivery","clinical services","CONCLUSION","mannequin","process","RESULTS","high-risk units","BACKGROUND","specifics","definitive treatment","total","response"],"language":"en"},

The presence and poor knowledge of zoonotic pathogens in India\u0027s wildlife and the occurrence of enormous human populations interfacing with, and critically linked to, forest ecosystems warrant attention. Factors such as diverse migratory bird populations, climate change, expanding human population and shrinking wildlife habitats play a significant role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens from India\u0027s wildlife. The introduction of a novel Kyasanur forest disease virus (family flaviviridae) into human populations in 1957 and subsequent occurrence of seasonal outbreaks illustrate the key role that India\u0027s wild animals play in the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic pathogens. Other high priority zoonotic diseases of wildlife origin which could affect both livestock and humans include influenza, Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, plague, leptospirosis, anthrax and leishmaniasis. Continuous monitoring of India\u0027s extensively diverse and dispersed wildlife is challenging, but their use as indicators should facilitate efficient and rapid disease-outbreak response across the region and occasionally the globe. Defining and prioritizing research on zoonotic pathogens in wildlife are essential, particularly in a multidisciplinary one-world one-health approach which includes human and veterinary medical studies at the wildlife-livestock-human interfaces. This review indicates that wild animals play an important role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens and provides brief summaries of the zoonotic diseases that have occurred in wild animals in India.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, B.

Interfering with receptor recognition is an attractive antiviral therapy, since it occurs before the viral genome has reached the relative safe haven within the cell. This chapter describes the use of an immunoprecipitation approach with Fc-tagged viral spike proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify and characterize the receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

We investigated the roles of a conserved stem-loop 2 (SL2) that resides in the 5\u0027UTR of the genome of a type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). RESULTS: We provided genetic evidences demonstrating that 1) the SL2 in type II PRRSV 5\u0027 UTR, N-SL2, could be structurally and functionally substituted by its counterpart in type I PRRSV, E-SL2; 2) the functionality of N-SL2 was dependent upon the G-C rich stem structure, while the ternary-loop size was irrelevant to RNA synthesis; 3) serial deletions showed that the stem integrity of N-SL2 was crucial for subgenomic mRNA synthesis; and 4) when extensive base-pairs in the stem region was deleted, an alternative N-SL2-like structure with different sequence was utilized for virus replication. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we concluded that the phylogenetically conserved SL2 in the 5\u0027 UTR was crucial for PRRSV virus replication, subgenomic mRNA synthesis in particular.","publish_time":"2011-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Jiaqi; Gao, Fei; Wei, Zuzhang; Liu, Ping; Liu, Changlong; Zheng, Haihong; Li, Yanhua; Lin, Tao; Yuan, Shishan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68081e6d2768743855003f159baf5cb7ab59087d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3096946.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21496223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved SL2","E-SL2","alternative N-SL2","UTR","PRRSV virus replication","stem region","stem integrity of N","type","conserved stem-loop","functionality of N","subgenomic mRNA synthesis","porcine arterivirus replication","regulatory elements","G-C rich stem structure","respiratory syndrome virus","regulatory sequences","untranslated region","ternary-loop size","positive-stranded RNA viruses","high-order structural elements","serial deletions","different sequence","extensive base-pairs","genome","counterpart","roles","genetic evidences","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with: a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) component, coupled with microvascular involvement with intra- and extra-vascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with DAD pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in non-hemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP). Multifocal acute injury of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the three Houston cases had evidence of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 gram heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 gram heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (670 gram heart). All three subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65 and 35.2 Kg/m2). Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with coagulopathy.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buja, L.

PROJECT: As part of its mission as one of the government\u0027s primary research facilities, the CC must be able to address epidemiologically significant public health concerns as they arise. After its initial description in the fall of 2002, the global threat of SARS became readily apparent. To address its mission, investigators working at the CC designed two protocols to study this new disease. To protect our patients and our staff, we quickly developed infection control guidelines based on what was known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this new disease. RESULTS: We created a multidisciplinary team to identify risk points during the admission and treatment phases of these protocols. This group met once or twice weekly for 6 months. New policies and procedures were created which were patterned after the CDC guidelines but which met the unique needs of our existing infrastructure and patient populations. We created a new position (isolation monitor) to ensure compliance with infection control precautions. We also conducted a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify additional areas of risk. Policies and procedures were reviewed by: 1) a multi-institute physician committee, 2) an external expert in hospital epidemiology, and 3) the CC Medical Executive Committee. Detailed practice sessions have been held to ensure compliance with these new and detailed precautions.

Methods Throat swabs from patients with an ILI presenting to physicians in sentinel practices were collected during the 2016\u20132017 influenza season. Results A total of 52 samples tested positive by FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Forty percent were influenza A virus, and subtype H3N2 virus was the major epidemic strain. However, nearly 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were caused by non-influenza pathogens. The results of the FilmArray assay and cell culture were identical, and this assay was more sensitive than a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Genetic analyses revealed new influenza A H3N2 variants belonging to a novel subclade 3C.2a2. Conclusions The FilmArray assay facilitates urgent testing and laboratory surveillance for common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. This study demonstrated the use of a highly sensitive assay using clinical samples that is feasible for application worldwide. This may lead to an increased rate of diagnosis of viral infections and to improved patient outcomes, and in particular to a reduction in the overuse of antibiotics and antivirals.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiu, Shu-Chun; Lin, Yung-Cheng; Wang, Hsiao-Chi; Hsu, Jen-Jen; Yeh, Ting-Kai; Liu, Hsin-Fu; Lin, Jih-Hui","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ffdae7f1b4c124454c916a2faf1fa87a5350b67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110889.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28625839/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217301650; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971217301650","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FilmArray assay","new influenza","sensitive assay","influenza season","non-influenza pathogens","results","laboratory surveillance","FilmArray Respiratory Panel","new multiplex PCR assay","rapid influenza diagnostic test","ILI cases","study","subtype H3N2 virus","bacterial respiratory pathogens","H3N2 variants","viral infections","clinical samples","sentinel sites","sentinel practices","conventional methods","increased rate of diagnosis","Methods Throat swabs","urgent testing","novel subclade","patients","cell culture","major epidemic strain","Genetic analyses","patient outcomes","physicians","Conclusions","Taiwan","illness","overuse of antibiotics","reduction","2a2","application","antivirals","winter months","Abstract Objectives","total","percent"],"language":"en"},

Substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water, and on production building surfaces, but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. This study was conducted to quantify the persistence of PEDV RNA via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at various time-temperature combinations and in infected piglet carcasses subjected to composting. Although this method does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, it is a rapid and sensitive test to evaluate materials for evidence of virus genome. RESULTS: In the first study, PEDV was suspended in cell culture media at 1 \u00D7 10(5) TCID50 per sample (1 mL sample size) and subjected to various time and temperature combinations in triplicate including temperatures of 37, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 \u00B0C and exposure times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days. At all temperatures, viral RNA copies declined over time, with the decline most marked and rapid at 65 and 70 \u00B0C. Detectable RNA did persist throughout the trial in all but the most extreme condition, where two of three samples incubated at 70 \u00B0C yielded undetectable viral RNA after 14 days. In the second study, PEDV-infected piglet carcasses were subjected to two cycles of composting lasting 36 and 37 days, respectively, for a total compost time of 73 days. Composting was performed in triplicate windrow sections housed inside biosecure, climate-controlled rooms using insulated bins designed to represent a continuous windrow compost pile. Temperatures reached 35\u201357 \u00B0C for 26 days of cycle 1 and 35\u201345 \u00B0C for 3 days of cycle 2. Samples consisting of carbon material with or without decomposed tissue as available per sample site collected at ten locations throughout the cross-section of each windrow section following the primary and secondary compost cycles yielded no detectable viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Composting appears to be an effective disposal method for PEDV-infected piglet carcasses under the conditions examined.

It has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis/sinusitis. Iota-carrageenan is effective against a broad variety of respiratory viruses, which are the most common cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is used as the active component in the antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic (1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan in 0.5% NaCl) and other medical device nasal sprays that are approved and marketed in the EU. Recently, we developed a nasal spray formulation containing both xylometazoline HCl (0.05%) and iota-carrageenan (0.12%) that provides decongestion and antiviral protection of the nasal mucosa at the same time. RESULTS: A set of in vitro experiments revealed that the vasoconstrictive properties of xylometazoline HCl and the antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan against human rhinovirus (hRV) 1a, hRV8 and human coronavirus OC43 were maintained in the formulation containing these two compounds. Permeation experiments using bovine nasal mucosa showed that iota-carrageenan had no significant influence on the permeation of xylometazoline HCl. Finally, in the local tolerance and toxicity study, it was shown that the formulation was well tolerated at the application site with no occurrence of erythema or edema in the nostrils of all rabbits or any signs of toxicity in any of the organs and tissues inspected. CONCLUSION: Investigations on compatibility of xylometazoline HCl and iota-carrageenan demonstrated that the substances do not influence each other, allowing both to fulfill their known specific clinical efficacy (xylometazoline HCl) and effectiveness (iota-carrageenan).","publish_time":"2018-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graf, Christine; Bernkop-Schn\u00FCrch, Andreas; Egyed, Alena; Koller, Christiane; Prieschl-Grassauer, Eva; Morokutti-Kurz, Martina","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/317f324d1116fd3d2d4933450d87528207846e36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6037157.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s167123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Iota-carrageenan","permeation of xylometazoline HCl","nasal decongestant","nasal submucosa","compatibility of xylometazoline HCl","nasal spray formulation","antiviral effectiveness of iota","bovine nasal mucosa","vasoconstrictive properties of xylometazoline HCl","Xylometazoline hydrochloride","treatment of nasal congestion","antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic","medical device nasal sprays","antiviral protection","Permeation experiments","human rhinovirus","significant influence","toxicity study","signs of toxicity","upper respiratory tract","human coronavirus OC43","broad variety of respiratory viruses","known specific clinical efficacy","NaCl","occurrence of erythema","common cause of infections","active component","nostrils","edema","rabbits","hRV8","rhinitis","Investigations","vasoconstriction","application site","local tolerance","CONCLUSION","years","sinusitis","decongestion","INTRODUCTION","organs","RESULTS","set of","time","substances","tissues","compounds","EU"],"language":"en"},

We stress-test three liquidity ratios for each firm with full and partial operating flexibility in two simulated distress scenarios corresponding to drops in sales of 50% and 75%, respectively. In the most adverse scenario, the average firm with partial operating flexibility would exhaust its cash holdings in about two years. At that point, its current liabilities would increase, on average, by eight times, suggesting that the average firm would have to resort to the debt market to prevent a liquidity crunch. Moreover, about 1/10th of all sample firms would become illiquid within six months. Finally, we study two different fiscal policies, tax deferrals and bridge loans, that governments could implement to mitigate the liquidity risk. Our analysis suggests bridge loans are more cost-effective to prevent a massive cash crunch.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Vito, Antonio; G\u00F3mez, Juan-Pedro","journal":"Journal of Accounting and Public Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8667d08ecde4f8942a6602a993dd955ac985665.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278425420300144; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278425420300144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["average firm","liquidity crunch","liquidity ratios","liquidity risk","liquidity of listed firms","partial operating flexibility","bridge loans","massive cash crunch","cash holdings","sample firms","tax deferrals","simulated distress scenarios","different fiscal policies","governments","health crisis","adverse scenario","COVID","analysis","debt market","countries","test","times","paper","sales","months","years","current liabilities","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label. Off-label uses are not under regulation in the outbreak because there is no specific regulation for this condition. OBJECTIVES: In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use. Further, we will describe the third way of off-label use, we named it pseudo-research and then we will state the most possible ethical challenges of off-label use for better perceptions and responsibility. RESULTS: The WHO considers off-label uses as country-specific. All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician\u2019s responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements. There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice. CONCLUSION: There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive. Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational. Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shojaei, Amirahmad; Salari, Pooneh","journal":"Daru","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f0e3bdfeb6fca11b42ddad4a58c3fd92ae03fbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207985.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40199-020-00351-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["label uses","label prescription","investigational use","clinical practice","ethical principles","specific regulation","strict regulation","international guideline","outbreak","treatment","possible ethical challenges","physician\u2019s responsibility","special guideline","country-specific","international regulatory bodies","autonomy","non-maleficence","codification","better perceptions","different types of approaches","world","disasters","ways","short communication","pseudo-research","OBJECTIVES","infected patients","CONCLUSION","proven medication","BACKGROUND","COVID","requirements","compilation","condition","medications","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Rapid detection of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very important due to its high rate of infectivity. This study aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China, and to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19 in attempts to contain spread of the virus. Methods This retrospective study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hunan Provincial People\u0027s Hospital (Changsha, China) between January 22 and February 15, 2020. All cases were detected using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The epidemiology and clinical characteristic of these cases were investigated according to outcome in attempts to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19. Results There were 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the fever outpatient department of Hunan Provincial People\u0027s Hospital.

METHODS: A set of questionnaire assessing coping patterns, coping flexibility, and depressive symptoms were administered to 428 students (234 men and 194 women). RESULTS: A total of 266 participants both completed the entire set of questionnaires and reported a frequency of two or more stressful life events (the criterion needed to calculate variance in perceived controllability). Findings showed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of both event frequency (r = .368, p \u003C .001) and event impact (r = .245, p \u003C .001) and lower levels of perceived controllability (r = -.261, p \u003C .001), coping effectiveness (r = -.375, p \u003C .001), and ratio of strategy to situation fit (r = -.108, p \u003C .05).

By using ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively, the presence of extracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA were measured. The levels of intracellular HBV DNA and mRNA were determined by using Southern blot or reverse-transcription-PCR, respectively. Intracellular distribution of antigen were measured by Western blot. A 1995\u03BCmol/L concentration of the commercially-available hepatitis B drug, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), was required to achieve 50% cytotoxicity against cultured cells (CC50) by day nine; in contrast, only 1747\u03BCmol/L of Compound 1 was required for the same result. Treatment of HepG2.2.15 cells with Compound 1 effectively suppress the secretion of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. IC50 values were determined to be 80\u03BCmol/L for HBsAg, 75\u03BCmol/L for HBeAg and 3.72\u03BCmol/L for supernatant HBV DNA at day nine post-exposure, as opposed to 266, 296, 30.09\u03BCmol/L, respectively, for ADV.

However, the mechanism of transmission from the wastewater of the sink P-trap to patients remains poorly understood. Herein we report the use of a designated hand-washing sink lab gallery to model dispersion of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli from sink wastewater to the surrounding environment. We found no dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli directly from the P-trap to the sink basin or surrounding countertop with coincident water flow from a faucet. However, when the GFP-expressing E. coli cells were allowed to mature in the P-trap under conditions similar to those in a hospital environment, a GFP-expressing E. coli-containing putative biofilm extended upward over 7 days to reach the strainer. This subsequently resulted in droplet dispersion to the surrounding areas (\u003C30 in.) during faucet operation. We also demonstrated that P-trap colonization could occur by retrograde transmission along a common pipe. We postulate that the organisms mobilize up to the strainer from the P-trap, resulting in droplet dispersion rather than dispersion directly from the P-trap. This work helps to further define the mode of transmission of bacteria from a P-trap reservoir to a vulnerable hospitalized patient. IMPORTANCE Many recent reports demonstrate that sink drain pipes become colonized with highly consequential multidrug-resistant bacteria, which then results in hospital-acquired infections. However, the mechanism of dispersal of bacteria from the sink to patients has not been fully elucidated. Through establishment of a unique sink gallery, this work found that a staged mode of transmission involving biofilm growth from the lower pipe to the sink strainer and subsequent splatter to the bowl and surrounding area occurs rather than splatter directly from the water in the lower pipe. We have also demonstrated that bacterial transmission can occur via connections in wastewater plumbing to neighboring sinks. This work helps to more clearly define the mechanism and risk of transmission from a wastewater source to hospitalized patients in a world with increasingly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can thrive in wastewater environments and cause infections in vulnerable patients.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotay, Shireen; Chai, Weidong; Guilford, William; Barry, Katie; Mathers, Amy J.","journal":"Appl Environ Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/615071c8c959f24857b1bad521cc432b59719bfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5377511.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.03327-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28235877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sink P-trap","sink wastewater","sink strainer","sink basin","P-trap reservoir","P-trap colonization","dispersion of GFP","mechanism of transmission","colonized sink traps","sink lab gallery","unique sink gallery","vulnerable patients","vulnerable hospitalized patients","retrograde transmission","risk of transmission","droplet dispersion","bacterial transmission","wastewater environments","wastewater source","wastewater plumbing","surrounding environment","staged mode of transmission","work","surrounding countertop","surrounding areas","lower pipe","Escherichia coli","coli cells","antibiotic-resistant bacteria","consequential multidrug-resistant bacteria","common pipe","hospital environment","mechanism of dispersal","model dispersion of green fluorescent protein","biofilm growth","subsequent splatter","recent reports","putative biofilm","cause infections","faucet operation","coincident water flow","increasing number of reports","genes of drug resistance","pipes","Gammaproteobacteria","designated hand","bowl","connections","world","conditions similar","sinks","days","IMPORTANCE","establishment","organisms"],"language":"en"},

A recent study found an association between butyrate\u2010producing gut (BPG) bacteria and less frequent development of lower respiratory viral infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (Haak et al, Blood 131(26): 2978, 2018). In this investigation, we examine the relationship between the abundance of BPG bacteria and the development of viral infections in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We recruited 168 kidney transplant recipients who provided 510 fecal specimens in the first 3 months after transplantation and profiled the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4\u2010V5 hypervariable region. We classified the kidney transplant recipients into higher BPG Bacteria Group and lower BPG Bacteria Group using the same criteria of 1% relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria as the Haak et al study. RESULTS: Administration of antibiotics against anaerobes was associated with a significant decrease in the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria. The higher BPG Bacteria Group was associated with less development of respiratory viral infections (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.28, P = .01) but not with less development of CMV viremia (HR: 0.38, P = .13) or BK viremia (HR: 1.02, P = .98) at 2 years post transplantation. CONCLUSION: Our pilot investigation supports future validation of the relationship between high relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and decreased risk for development of respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, John R.; Huang, Jennifer; Magruder, Matthew; Zhang, Lisa T.; Gong, Catherine; Sholi, Adam N.; Albakry, Shady; Edusei, Emmanuel; Muthukumar, Thangamani; Lubetzky, Michelle; Dadhania, Darshana M.; Taur, Ying; Pamer, Eric G.; Suthanthiran, Manikkam","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38d187e8a40d8f245fc8268c05323ab619a15d89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6917841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544324/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13180","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BPG","BPG Bacteria Group","BK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of infections","lower BPG Bacteria Group","higher BPG Bacteria Group","development of viral infections","high relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria","development of respiratory viral infections","frequent development of lower respiratory viral infections","gut microbiota","gut microbiome","cohort of kidney transplant recipients","development of CMV viremia","HR","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","Haak et","relationship","BK viremia","pilot investigation","recent study","years post transplantation","decreased risk","V4","S rRNA gene sequencing","future validation","criteria","Hazard Ratio","anaerobes","significant decrease","butyrate","fecal specimens","V5 hypervariable region","association","months","Clostridium difficile infection","RESULTS","Administration of antibiotics","CONCLUSION","Blood","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rydzewski, Robert M.","journal":"Real World Drug Discovery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72e909e25c083baf77a260911f2128fc01fc2952.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152393.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080466170000051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780080466170000051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new target","proposed target","Target identification","term target validation","new drug discovery projects","new project","clinical drug","affirmative evidence","minimal evidence","bins","human disease state","types of projects researchers","different things","different people","disease progression","labor-intensive process","human trials","brief overview","time","mAB","small molecule","therapeutic effect","case","mouse knockout","RNA interference experiment","disastrous losses","money","monoclonal antibody","chapter","manpower","agent","Publisher Summary","cells","rate","symptoms","science","significant efficacy","interaction","business decisions","devoted resources","chemist","beauty","commonalities","steps","targets","clinician"],"language":"en"},

As a first step toward understanding the effect of PDCoV on host cells, we elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after PDCoV infection. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of PDCoV-induced apoptosis and reduction of PDCoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, PDCoV infection necessitated the activation of the initiator caspase-9 responsible for the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Experimental data indicated that PDCoV infection led to Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in specific relocation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c) into the cytoplasm. Treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, significantly suppressed PDCoV-triggered apoptosis and viral replication. Moreover, cyt c release was completely abrogated in PDCoV-infected cells in the presence of CsA, suggesting the critical role of MPTP in intrinsic apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. Altogether, our results indicate that PDCoV infection stimulates MOMP either via Bax recruitment or MPTP opening to permit the release of apoptogenic cyt c into the cytoplasm, thereby leading to execution of the caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway to facilitate viral replication in vitro.","publish_time":"2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Yoo Jin; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c1dba1cf086bd7f0179608c001e33e8330bacde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940190/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218302260; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218302260; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.06.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV infection","inhibition of PDCoV","effect of PDCoV","reduction of PDCoV replication","PDCoV-infected cells","suppressed PDCoV-triggered apoptosis","intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway","caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway","induced apoptosis","mitochondrial cytochrome c","caspase-dependent pathway","cyt c release","viral replication","initiator caspase","release of apoptogenic cyt c","pan-caspase inhibitor","MOMP","cytoplasm","inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore","mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization","critical role of MPTP","Bax recruitment","presence of CsA","host cells","causative agent of severe clinical diarrhea","intestinal pathological damage","association","process of apoptotic cell death","mechanisms","specific relocation","response","discovered enteric coronavirus","piglets","execution","activation","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","use","Experimental data","results","Treatment","cyclosporin","step"],"language":"en"},

This virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors, especially UV light inactivation. Molecular techniques, such as PCR-based methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction), are commonly used to detect and identify viral contamination in water, although PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. A combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. This study aimed to assess the integrity and viability of human adenovirus (HAdV) in environmental water and evaluate circulating strains by molecular characterization in three sites of the water supply in Florian\u00F3polis, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil: Peri Lagoon water, spring source water, and water from the public water supply system. METHODS: Water samples were collected, concentrated and HAdV quantified by real-time PCR. Viral integrity was evaluated by enzymatic assay (DNase I) and infectivity by plaque assay (PA) and integrated cell culture using transcribed mRNA (ICC-RT-qPCR). Samples containing particles of infectious HAdV were selected for sequencing and molecular characterization. RESULTS: The analyzed sites contained 83, 66 and 58% undamaged HAdV particles (defined as those in which the genetic material is protected by the viral capsid) at Peri Lagoon, spring source water and public supply system water, respectively. Of these, 66% of the particles (by PA) and 75% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) HAdV were shown to be infectious, due to being undamaged in Peri Lagoon, 33% (by PA) and 58% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in spring source water and 8% (by PA) and 25% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in the public water supply system. ICC-RT-qPCR, a very sensitive and rapid technique, was able to detect as low as 1 \u00D7 10(2) HAdV genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in the environmental water samples. The molecular characterization studies indicated that HAdV-2 was the prevalent serotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a lack of proper public health measures. We suggest that HAdV can be efficiently used as a marker of environmental and drinking water contamination and ICC-RT-qPCR demonstrated greater sensitivity and speed of detection of infectious viral particles compared to PA.","publish_time":"2013-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fongaro, Gislaine; Nascimento, Mariana A do; Rigotto, Caroline; Ritterbusch, Giseli; da Silva, Alessandra D\u2019 A; Esteves, Paulo A; Barardi, C\u00E9lia R M","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78330b92514605d59bb22b99c517538f83c2e2b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3686584.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23714224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","ICC","PA."],"locations":["Santa Catarina Island","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["water disinfection","environmental water samples","spring source water","Peri Lagoon water","particles of infectious HAdV","public supply system water","public water supply system","drinking water contamination","qPCR","ICC-RT","undamaged HAdV particles","milliliter of infectious viral particles","non-infectious viral particles","viral contamination","Viral integrity","viral capsid","HAdV genome copies","environmental stressors","environmental waters","marker of environmental","detection of infectious viruses","molecular characterization studies","real-time PCR","Molecular techniques","integrated cell culture","PCR-based methods","combination of cell culture","RESULTS","lack of proper public health measures","speed of detection","plaque assay","enzymatic assay","Human adenoviruses","analyzed sites","viability of human adenovirus","Brazil","Santa Catarina Island","Florian\u00F3polis","transcribed mRNA","greater sensitivity","circulating strains","infectivity","discrimination","Polymerase Chain Reaction","UV light inactivation","HAdVs","DNase","CPE","sequencing","rapid technique","cytopathic effects","leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis","BACKGROUND","genetic material","CONCLUSIONS","prevalent serotype","study"],"language":"en"},

Here we investigated the role of CD200R activation in syngeneic mouse tumor models. We showed that agonistic CD200R antibody reached tumors, but had no significant impact on tumor growth and minor effect on infiltration of immune myeloid cells.

The presence of either endogenous or tumor-expressed CD200 restored the growth of metastatic melanoma foci.

Though US hospitals face intensifying pressure to lower their cost, including proposals to extend Medicare payment rates to all admissions, the transferability of Indian hospitals\u2019 cost advantages to US peers remains unclear. Methods Using time-driven activity-based costing methods, we estimate the average cost of personnel and space for an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at two American hospitals and one Indian hospital (NH). All three hospitals are Joint Commission accredited and have reputations for use of modern performance management methods. Our case study applies several analytic steps to distinguish transferable from non-transferable sources of NH\u2019s cost savings. Results After removing non-transferable sources of efficiency, NH\u2019s residual cost advantage primarily rests on shifting tasks to less-credentialed and/or less-experienced personnel who are supervised by highly-skilled personnel when perceived risk of complications is low. NH\u2019s high annual CABG volume facilitates such supervised work \u201Cdownshifting.\u201D The study is subject to limitations inherent in case studies, does not account for the younger age of NH\u2019s patients, or capture savings attributable to NH\u2019s negligible frequency of re-admission or post-acute care facility placement.

It is best known for its ability to function as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (hence the other name for this protein, EMMPRIN), but has also been shown to regulate lymphocyte responsiveness, monocarboxylate transporter expression and spermatogenesis. These functions reflect multiple interacting partners of CD147. Among these CD147-interacting proteins cyclophilins represent a particularly interesting class, both in terms of structural considerations and potential medical implications. CD147 has been shown to function as a signalling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins A and B and to mediate chemotactic activity of cyclophilins towards a variety of immune cells. Recent studies using in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated a role for cyclophilin\u2013CD147 interactions in the regulation of inflammatory responses in a number of diseases, including acute lung inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease.

OBJECTIVES: To examine pediatric asthma mortality and hospitalization trends of selected countries across Asia Pacific, and also patterns of asthma drug utilization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mortality and population data were sourced from the World Health Organization\u0027s mortality database. Data on hospitalization were obtained by direct inquiry and from government and scientific publications. Drug use for asthma was expressed as a controller-to-reliever (C:R) ratio (ie, units of inhaled corticosteroids/units of short-acting \u03B2-agonists, sold in each country). Time-series regression analyses were used to examine temporal patterns and study association between deaths, hospitalizations, and drug use. RESULTS: Japan showed a decreasing trend in pediatric asthma mortality whereas an increase was observed in Thailand. Hospitalizations decreased in Australia and Singapore but increased in Taiwan, Republic of China. C:R ratios increased significantly across the countries. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed trends in pediatric asthma mortality and hospitalization rates were observed, which coincided with a uniform increase in C:R ratios. This may reflect importance of other aspects of asthma management besides pharmacotherapy.","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chua, Kun Lin; Soh, Shu E; Ma, Stefan; Lee, Bee Wah","journal":"World Allergy Organ J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0e6b0fee027cdf12f61689134274120a0ca5903.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1536008edcc909523ffc39c62b8389ba0ee76f95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3651014.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1939455119305162; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1939455119305162; https://doi.org/10.1097/wox.0b013e3181a7c288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23283014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Asia Pacific","Thailand","Australia"],"keyphrases":["pediatric asthma mortality","patterns of asthma drug utilization","prevalence of childhood asthma","aspects of asthma management","hospitalization trends of selected countries","hospitalization rates","R ratios","Drug use","Asia Pacific","Mixed trends","World Health Organization\u0027s mortality database","hospitalizations","units of short","temporal patterns","population data","uniform increase","units of inhaled corticosteroids","deaths","decreasing trend","study association","direct inquiry","wide variability","acting \u03B2-agonists","Taiwan","government","Singapore","Japan","reliever","METHODS","Time-series regression analyses","CONCLUSIONS","scientific publications","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Australia","MATERIALS","importance","pharmacotherapy","controller","OBJECTIVES","Republic of China","country","Thailand"],"language":"en"},

The large quantity of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) found in tissue samples is thought to be a major factor contributing to the comparatively lower sensitivity of detecting RNA viruses, as a sequence-independent PCR is used to amplify unknown samples for microarray analysis. This study aimed to determine whether depletion or exclusion of rRNA can improve microarray detection and simplify its analysis. Therefore, two different rRNA depletion and exclusion protocols, RiboMinus\u2122 technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, were applied to the microarray sample processing and the outcome was compared with those of the sequence-independent amplification protocol. This study concludes that the two procedures, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have negligible effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity. Currently, existing protocols of random amplification and background adjustment are pertinent for the purpose of sample processing for microarray analysis.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGowan, Sarah; Nunez-Garcia, Javier; Steinbach, Falko; La Rocca, Anna; Blake, Damer; Dastjerdi, Akbar","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6d49512ce3a1a6d71dc5e5c45a8bd9e76662b5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034125/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414002687; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414002687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.07.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microarray analysis","exclusion of rRNA","microarray detection","different rRNA depletion","microarray sample processing","exclusion protocols","non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides","microarrays detection","study","sequence-independent amplification protocol","purpose of sample processing","sequence-independent PCR","existing protocols of random amplification","RNA viruses","major factor","unknown samples","lower sensitivity","tissue samples","Abstract Pan viral DNA microarrays","multiple viral infections","major laboratory assets","significant enhancement of sensitivity","large quantity of ribosomal RNA","RiboMinus","technology","background adjustment","negligible effect","control of infectious diseases","techniques","novel","outcome","combination","procedures"],"language":"en"},

Here, we detected coronavirus sequences in next\u2010generation sequence data created from Eonycteris spelaea faeces and urine. We also screened by PCR urine samples, faecal samples and rectal swabs collected from six species of bats in Singapore between 2011 and 2014, all of which were negative. The phylogenetic analysis indicates this novel strain is most closely related to lineage D Betacoronaviruses detected in a diverse range of bat species. This is the second time that coronaviruses have been detected in cave nectar bats, but the first coronavirus sequence data generated from this species. Bat species from which this group of coronaviruses has been detected are widely distributed across SE Asia, South Asia and Southern China. They overlap geographically, often share roosting sites and have been witnessed to forage on the same plant. The addition of sequence data from this group of viruses will allow us to better understand coronavirus evolution and host specificity.","publish_time":"2016-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendenhall, I.

Compounds bearing a phenyl substituent at position 8 of the spiro ring, exhibited significant antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 at concentrations of 3.9 and 7.8 \u00B5M. Still, some of the tested compounds displayed activity on mycobacteria with MIC values of 16 and 31 \u00B5M. Four of the indole-spirothiazolidinone derivatives were found to be moderately active against Punta Toro virus, yellow fever virus or Sindbis virus in Vero cells. The antiviral EC(50) values were in the range of 1.9\u201312 \u00B5M and the selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration) was above 10 in some cases. The most potent effect was seen with the compound that is methylated at positions 2 and 8 of the spirothiazolidinone system.

To address this problem, real-time gene expression assays were coupled with cytokine Elispot and protein analyses to assess the nature of the anti-PRRSV response of pigs immunized with modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. Although T helper 1 (Th1) immunity was elicited in all vaccinated animals, as evidenced by the genesis of PRRSV-specific interferon-gamma secreting cells (IFNG SC), the overall extent of the memory response was variable and generally weak. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from these pigs responded to PRRSV exposure with a limited increase in their expression of the Th1 immune markers, IFNG, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-15 (IL15), and a reduction in the quantity of mRNAs encoding the innate and inflammatory proteins, IL1B, IL8 and IFNA. Efforts to enhance Th1 immunity, by utilizing an expression plasmid encoding porcine IFNA (pINA) as an adjuvant, resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of PRRSV-specific IFNG SC but only minor changes overall in the expression of Th1 associated cytokine or innate immune marker mRNA by virus-stimulated PBMC. Administration of pINA, however, did correlate with decreased IL1B secretion by cultured, unstimulated PBMC but had no effect on their ability to release IFNG. Thus, while exogenous addition of IFNA during PRRSV vaccination has an impact on the development of a Th1 immune response, other alterations will be required for substantial boosting of virus-specific protection.","publish_time":"2004-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Royaee, Atabak R.; Husmann, Robert J.; Dawson, Harry D.; Calzada-Nova, Gabriela; Schnitzlein, William M.; Zuckermann, Federico A.; Lunney, Joan K.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7cfc8e761e9ca94fce58b846884eec614d4350d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112652.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002533; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002533","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC","IFNG","IFNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of Th1","Th1 immune response","PRRSV vaccination","frequency of PRRSV","genesis of PRRSV","PRRSV exposure","anti-PRRSV response of pigs","Th1 immunity","specific IFNG SC","Th1 immune markers","virus-stimulated PBMC","natural response of pigs","expression plasmid","memory response","porcine IFNA","specific protection","respiratory syndrome virus","modified live virus","substantial boosting of virus","unstimulated PBMC","innate immune marker mRNA","real-time gene expression assays","exogenous addition of IFNA","specific interferon-gamma secreting cells","cytokine Elispot","temporary increase","limited increase","overall extent","better protection","Administration of pINA","decreased IL1B secretion","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells","tumor necrosis factor-alpha","inflammatory proteins","minor changes","interleukin","nature","infections","alterations","development","impact","quantity of mRNAs","protein analyses","problem","MLV","vaccine","IL8","effect","adjuvant","heterologous challenges","pathogen","reduction","IL15","T helper","vaccinations","vaccinated animals","ability","Efforts"],"language":"en"},

The model highlights the critical role of modular organization and intrinsic disorder of the N protein in the formation and functions of the dynamic RNP capsid in RNA viruses.

Methods Patients were recruited from two acute hospital sites in Leicester (UK) over 3 successive winters. Samples were taken for viral and bacterial testing. Results Of the 780 patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness 345 (44%) had a respiratory virus detected. Picornaviruses were the most commonly isolated viruses (detected in 23% of all patients). Virus detection rates exceeded 50% in patients with exacerbation of asthma (58%), acute bronchitis and Influenza-like-illness (64%), and ranged from 30 to 50% in patients with an exacerbation of COPD (38%), community acquired pneumonia (36%) and congestive cardiac failure (31%). Bacterial detection was relatively frequent in patients with exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia (25% and 33% respectively) but was uncommon in all other groups. Antibiotic use was high across all clinical groups (76% overall) and only 21% of all antibiotic use occurred in patients with detectable bacteria. Conclusions Respiratory viruses are the predominant detectable aetiological agents in most hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness. Antibiotic usage in hospital remains excessive including in clinical conditions associated with low rates of bacterial detection.

Unsurprisingly, much of the contemporary literature focuses on the multifarious threats posed by human and, increasingly, non-human mobility. Prompted by current geopolitical concerns surrounding the public health implications of regular international air travel, this paper extends such research by exploring the ways in which the technology of the aeroplane stimulated the production of new international sanitary initiatives aimed at safeguarding global public health in an era of mass aeromobility. By tracing the development of sanitary regulations for aerial navigation, from their origins in the 1920s through the twentieth century in particular, we document the emergence of a series of public health interventions that were designed to limit the public health threat associated with increased international air travel and the concomitant rise in the mobility of infectious diseases. From inoculation certificates to quarantine and the routine \u2018disinsection\u2019 of passenger aircraft with powerful insecticides, modern air travel is replete with a complex set of procedures designed to lessen the risks associated with flying between different climatic and ecological zones. Our detailed examination of the historical context in which these procedures were devised and implemented leads us to consider the importance of time and space, power and efficacy, to the development of a more nuanced understanding of the shifting public health response to an increasingly fluid, mobile, and inter-connected society.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Budd, Lucy; Morag Bell,; Brown, Tim","journal":"Political Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eca9a0fdf27c167dcf853a203fd612ab699e38b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134935.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0962629809001115; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2009.10.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629809001115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288366/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health threat","public health implications of regular international air travel","safeguarding global public health","shifting public health response","series of public health interventions","increased international air travel","modern air travel","mobility of infectious diseases","development of sanitary regulations","spread of infectious diseases","non-human mobility","production of new international sanitary initiatives","implications of globalisation","complex set of procedures","powerful insecticides","concomitant rise","passenger aircraft","nuanced understanding","routine","flying","aerial navigation","paper","current geopolitical concerns","era of mass aeromobility","space","ecological zones","disinsection","historical context","multifarious threats","efficacy","risks","recent years","aeroplane","emergence","inter-connected society","importance of time","area of concern","political geographers","detailed examination","contemporary literature","technology","origins","Abstract","research","century","ways","inoculation certificates"],"language":"en"},

Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were, the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination partners. Furthermore, results of this study highlight an important role for the stem region of the RNA structure elements in promoting recombination.

The part dedicated to influenza viruses was based on consensus sequences specific for one gene generated from global alignments of a large number of influenza virus sequences available in databanks. RESULTS: For each HA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9) and NA (N1, N2 and N7) molecular type chosen to be tested, 1 to 3 consensus sequences were computed and tiled on the microarray. A total of 12 influenza virus samples from different host origins (humans, pigs, horses and birds) and isolated over a period of about 50 years were used in this study. Influenza viruses were correctly identified, and in most cases with the accurate information of the time of their emergence. CONCLUSIONS: PathogenID v2.0 microarray demonstrated its ability to type and subtype influenza viruses, often to the level of viral variants, with a minimum number of tiled sequences. This validated the strategy of using consensus sequences, which do not exist in nature, for our microarray design. The versatility, rapidity and high discriminatory power of the PathogenID v2.0 microarray could prove critical to detect and identify viral genome reassortment events resulting in a novel virus with epidemic or pandemic potential and therefore assist health authorities to make efficient decisions about patient treatment and outbreak management.","publish_time":"2010-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leclercq, India; Berthet, Nicolas; Bat\u00E9jat, Christophe; Rousseaux, Claudine; Dickinson, Philip; Old, Iain G; Kong, Katherine; Kennedy, Giulia C; Cole, Stewart T; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f161447bea90a1e414e3cb22557efe9156bab8e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3091733.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-11-586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20961419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microarray design","influenza virus samples","PathogenID v2","subtype influenza viruses","consensus sequences specific","resequencing microarray","large number of influenza virus sequences available","minimum number of tiled sequences","novel virus","molecular type","level of viral variants","viral genome reassortment events","different host origins","humans","efficient decisions","H3","pigs","pandemic potential","high discriminatory power","patient treatment","health authorities","H1","birds","N1","H2","H5","H9","H7","horses","N2","N7","global alignments","gene","ability","outbreak management","HA","versatility","rapidity","databanks","various strategies of sequence selection","accurate information","time","period","BACKGROUND","total","CONCLUSIONS","years","cases","emergence","RESULTS","nature","strategy","study"],"language":"en"},

These novel treatments, which focus either on pathophysiological aspects of influenza virus infection or the neutralization of virus with antibodies, are the subject of this review. Cytokine dysregulation has been observed in patients with severe influenza, such as avian influenza A (H5N1) and pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1pdm09) virus infections, but the role of immunomodulatory therapy is unclear, due to lack of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Convalescent plasma appears to be useful as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of H5N1 and H1N1pdm09 infections. Until lately, data interpretation was limited to case reports and studies of non-randomized design, but a recent RCT found that patients with severe influenza A (H1N1pdm09) who were treated with hyperimmune immunoglobulin from persons who had survived the same disease had a lower peak viral load and lower mortality than controls, providing treatment was begun within 5 days of symptom onset. The efficacy of agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including intravenous immunoglobulin, N-acetylcysteine, acute use of statins, macrolides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, celecoxib and mesalazine, and the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy, deserve more investigation and where feasible, studies by RCTs. Prospective observational studies have shown that systemic corticosteroids increase morbidity (e.g., secondary infections) and mortality in H1N1pdm09 influenza.

The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technology allows the identification of traceable differences in the pathogen genome that are transforming our ability to understand high-resolution disease transmission, sometimes even down to the host-to-host scale. We review recent examples of the use of pathogen whole-genome sequencing for the purpose of forensic tracing of transmission pathways, focusing on the particular problems where evolutionary dynamics must be supplemented by epidemiological information on the most likely timing of events as well as possible transmission pathways.

The Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land has been recorded since the 4th century, while the Hajj, Islam\u0027s great pilgrimage, has existed for fourteen centuries, of which a body of literature devoted to the travelogues of the Hajj has been recorded for over ten centuries. Football is a sport played worldwide by more than 1.5 million teams and in 300,000 clubs. Most however play outside of the officially organized sphere: more than 4 percent of the global population plays football, including 270 million amateur players. Assembling for specific events is a uniquely human behavior, though the formal study of crowds did not begin until the mid-Twentieth Century. Today Mass Gathering Medicine focuses on the public health challenges to hosting events attended by a large enough number of people, at a specific site, for a defined period of time, likely to strain both the planning and response to the mass gathering of a community, state, or nation. All of us can recall attending a mass gathering, whether it be watching one\u0027s favorite rock group in performance or assembling for religious pilgrimage. Certainly, the event itself is transporting and transforming and the unison of behaviors and activities can be enormously enriching, uplifting and overwhelming, just as much as they may be at times dangerous and high risk. This review seeks to draw contrasts and comparisons between sporting gatherings and religious gatherings with a chief focus on Hajj, among the largest of all mass gatherings today. We will find there are some powerful similarities as well as stark differences. Each bequeaths a legacy which can inform the other and, as we make our observations, we join with you and the legions of other investigators who continue to remain fascinated and enthralled by mass gatherings which are among the most beloved and beholden events of modern humanity.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Qanta A.; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cacb30752bce621dbdd40599a9b45bc13e7e77f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110704.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2018.06.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893918301315; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893918301315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mass gatherings","religious gatherings","Hajj","sporting gatherings","specific events","religious pilgrimage","collective behavior","Abstract Human behavior","Football","Christian pilgrimage","century","centuries","Islam\u0027s great pilgrimage","beholden events of modern humanity","specific site","formal study of crowds","comparisons","percent","performance","chief focus","defined period of time","public health challenges","number of people","contrasts","Medicine","favorite rock group","times dangerous","high risk","powerful similarities","stark differences","global population","travelogues","Holy Land","community","state","planning","body of literature","unison of behaviors","activities","investigators","nation","organized sphere","review","amateur players","response","teams","clubs","legions","legacy","observations"],"language":"en"},

Given this change, medical students nationwide had to grapple with how and where they could fill the evolving needs of their schools\u2019 affiliated clinical sites, physicians, and patients and the community. APPROACH: At Harvard Medical School (HMS), student leaders created a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team to: (1) develop a student-led organizational structure that would optimize students\u2019 ability to efficiently mobilize interested peers in the COVID-19 response, both clinically and in the community, in a strategic, safe, smart, and resource-conscious way; and (2) serve as a liaison with the administration and hospital leaders to identify evolving needs and rapidly engage students in those efforts. OUTCOMES: Within a week of its inception, the COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team had more than 500 medical student volunteers from HMS and had shared the organizational framework of the response team with multiple medical schools across the country. The HMS student volunteers joined any of the 4 virtual committees to complete this work: Education for the Medical Community, Education for the Broader Community, Activism for Clinical Support, and Community Activism. NEXT STEPS: The COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team helped to quickly mobilize hundreds of students and has been integrated into HMS\u2019s daily workflow. It may serve as a useful model for other schools and hospitals seeking medical student assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps include expanding the initiative further, working with the leaders of response teams at other medical schools to coordinate efforts, and identifying new areas of need at local hospitals and within nearby communities that might benefit from medical student involvement as the pandemic evolves.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soled, Derek; Goel, Shivangi; Barry, Danika; Erfani, Parsa; Joseph, Nicholos; Kochis, Michael; Uppal, Nishant; Velasquez, David; Vora, Kruti; Scott, Kirstin Woody","journal":"Acad Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a6fd88c503de961664e7b46e204bdd715071d6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188031.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Association of American Medical Colleges","Harvard Medical School","HMS","COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team","the Medical Community, Education"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Medical Community","medical students","Medical Student Response Team","medical student volunteers","medical student assistance","medical student involvement","COVID","student leaders","multiple medical schools","Harvard Medical School","HMS student volunteers","Association of American Medical Colleges","Community Activism","leaders of response teams","Broader Community","pandemic","hundreds of students","Education","hospital leaders","evolving needs","efforts","STEPS","Clinical Support","local hospitals","organizational framework","organizational structure","schools\u2019 affiliated clinical sites","suspension","direct patient contact responsibilities","physicians","students\u2019 ability","new areas of need","nearby communities","interested peers","administration","patients","resource-conscious way","virtual committees","liaison","week","useful model","APPROACH","country","inception","HMS\u2019s daily workflow","initiative","change","OUTCOMES"],"language":"en"},

Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Letko, Michael; Marzi, Andrea; Munster, Vincent","journal":"Nat Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da02aabde58535955fd6cc22c42b4f3798fd7b26.json; document_parses/pdf_json/34853525912093f63e95d2dcbdbcd6bceb37b689.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095430.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094589/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0688-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different lineage B viruses","lineage B betacoronaviruses","recent SARS-CoV","emerging SARS-CoV","human cells","species barrier","significant barrier","viral entry","humans","human ACE2","ability","different species","receptor usage","unknown receptor","zoonotic viral outbreak","thousands of coronavirus sequences","diverse animals","global viromics projects","animal markets","geographic regions","outbreaks of severe","cell types","host protease processing","hampered efforts","approach","respiratory illness","years","tools available"],"language":"en"},

The most striking physiochemical feature of the N protein of SARS-CoV is that it is a typical basic protein with a high predicted pI and high hydrophilicity, which is consistent with its function of binding to the ribophosphate backbone of the RNA molecule. The predicted high extent of phosphorylation of the N protein on multiple candidate phosphorylation sites demonstrates that it would be related to important functions, such as RNA-binding and localization to the nucleolus of host cells. Subsequent study shows that there is an SR-rich region in the N protein and this region might be involved in the protein-protein interaction. The abundant antigenic sites predicted in the N protein, as well as experimental evidence with synthesized polypeptides, indicate that the N protein is one of the major antigens of the SARS-CoV. Compared with other viral structural proteins, the low variation rate of the N protein with regards to its size suggests its importance to the survival of the virus.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jingqiang; Ji, Jia; Ye, Jia; Zhao, Xiaoqian; Wen, Jie; Li, Wei; Hu, Jianfei; Li, Dawei; Sun, Min; Zeng, Haipan; Hu, Yongwu; Tian, Xiangjun; Tan, Xuehai; Xu, Ningzhi; Zeng, Changqing; Wang, Jian; Bi, Shengli; Yang, Huanming","journal":"Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5172421.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1672022903010180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022903010180","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein-protein interaction","N protein of SARS","typical basic protein","RNA-binding","high predicted pI","predicted high extent of phosphorylation","high hydrophilicity","genome RNA molecule","SARS-CoV","multiple candidate phosphorylation sites","function of binding","abundant antigenic sites","SR-rich region","low variation rate","combination","localization","ribophosphate backbone","regards","viral structural proteins","nucleoprotein","synthesized polypeptides","experimental evidence","major antigens","striking physiochemical feature","importance","nucleolus of host cells","nucleocapsid","survival","important functions","Coronaviridae family","virus","virion","Subsequent study"],"language":"en"},

This role entails evaluating endoscopic biopsies for any characteristic inflammatory pattern, identifying pathogens which may be present and excluding other look-alike pathologies. Recent advances in commercially available diagnostic modalities, including molecular techniques, have further broadened the scope of the histopathologist\u2019s armamentarium. This review outlines a practical pattern-based approach to diagnosing tropical GIT infections in endoscopic material, so as to assist pathologists less familiar with this spectrum of pathology.","publish_time":"2017-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slavik, Tomas; Lauwers, Gregory Y.","journal":"Virchows Arch","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ae19f9a1a50426f726069289d002dda048e7a74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087759.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-017-2166-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28589386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tropical GIT disease","tropical GIT infections","pathology of tropical infectious disease","infectious pathogens","exposure of histopathologists","endoscopic biopsies","endoscopic material","molecular techniques","pivotal role","role entails","spectrum of pathology","high risk of exposure","characteristic inflammatory pattern","current microbiologic techniques","practical pattern-based approach","available diagnostic modalities","contaminated water","global human migration","developed countries","faecal-oral route of transmission","unforeseen consequence","soil","International travels","Recent advances","food","histology","primary site of infection","scope","review","look-alike pathologies","histopathologist\u2019s armamentarium","gastrointestinal tract","regions"],"language":"en"},

Over 1 yr, background information associated with dairy calvings and colostrum management practices were recorded on 21 commercial dairy farms. Colostrum samples (n = 1,239) were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, and IgG concentration. A subset was analyzed for somatic cell count and total viable bacteria count. Factors associated with nutritional and IgG concentrations were determined using both univariate and multivariate models. This study found that 51% of calves were administered their first feed of colostrum via esophageal tube, and the majority of calves (80%) were fed \u003E2 L of colostrum at their first feed (mean = 2.9 L, SD = 0.79), at a mean time of 3.2 h (SD 4.36) after birth, but this ranged across farms. The mean colostral fat, protein, and lactose percentages and IgG concentrations were 6.4%, 14%, 2.7%, and 55 mg/mL, respectively. The mean somatic cell count and total viable count were 6.3 log10 and 6.1 log10, respectively. Overall, 44% of colostrum samples contained \u003C50 mg/mL IgG, and almost 81% were in excess of industry guidelines (\u003C100,000 cfu/mL) for bacterial contamination. In the multivariate model, IgG concentration was associated with parity and time from parturition to colostrum collection. The nutritional properties of colostrum were associated with parity, prepartum vaccination, season of calving, and dry cow nutrition. The large variation in colostrum quality found in the current study highlights the importance of routine colostrum testing, and now that factors associated with lower-quality colostrum on grassland-based dairy farms have been identified, producers and advisers are better informed and able to develop risk-based colostrum management protocols.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunn, A.; Ashfield, A.; Earley, B.; Welsh, M.; Gordon, A.; Morrison, S.

In contrast, colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus is rare (approximately 1%), predominantly transient and associated with prior contact to the health care system. Additionally, in recent years livestock-associated S. aureus clones contributed to colonization in humans, especially in those working in close contact to farm animals. A considerable percentage of colonizing S. aureus isolates is equipped with enterotoxin genes. Humans carrying enterotoxigenic isolates represent a contamination source when handling food, thus generating a continuous risk of S. aureus food intoxication. Molecular characterization of isolates colonizing humans and obtained from food, respectively, enables the tracing of food-related outbreaks back to the source of food intoxication. We will summarize current knowledge about the S. aureus population colonizing humans, including those in close contact to animals and food, respectively. Additionally, we will review data on the molecular characterization of S. aureus isolates related to staphylococcal foodborne disease and the elucidation of staphylococcal foodborne outbreaks. Staphylococcal food poisoning is a common foodborne disease, mediated by the ingestion of enterotoxins produced by enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus. For several outbreaks of foodborne S. aureus disease, colonized personnel could be identified as the source of food contamination. However, because of the widespread occurrence of enterotoxigenic strains as human colonizers and the often transient nature of colonization, the source of contamination cannot always be identified unambiguously. Therefore, compliance with hygiene measures is the most important requirement to prevent food contamination by both human colonization and environmental S. aureus reservoirs.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strommenger, Birgit; Layer, Franziska; Werner, Guido","journal":"Staphylococcus aureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/354facbb484ecbda5da7066834ee0444c5d53ce0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150186.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096710000097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096710000097","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aureus isolates","aureus food intoxication","aureus disease","source of food contamination","aureus clones","aureus population","aureus reservoirs","handling food","tracing of food","source of food intoxication","humans","Staphylococcal food poisoning","enterotoxigenic isolates","Abstract Staphylococcus aureus","contamination source","source of contamination","human colonization","outbreaks of foodborne","staphylococcal foodborne disease","common foodborne disease","Molecular characterization of isolates","elucidation of staphylococcal foodborne outbreaks","susceptible human-adapted isolates","close contact","related outbreaks","transient nature of colonization","human colonizers","prior contact","widespread occurrence of enterotoxigenic strains","considerable percentage of colonizing","common flora","farm animals","colonized personnel","recent years livestock-associated","continuous risk","skin","important requirement","methicillin-resistant","hygiene measures","mucous membranes of mammals","health care system","ingestion of enterotoxins","contrast","current knowledge","enterotoxin genes","compliance","data"],"language":"en"},

It is thought to be a potential reservoir host of Tacaribe virus, an arenavirus closely related to the South American hemorrhagic fever viruses. We performed transcriptome sequencing and annotation from lung, kidney and spleen tissues using 454 and Illumina platforms to develop this species as an animal model. More than 100,000 contigs were assembled, with 25,000 genes that were functionally annotated. Of the remaining unannotated contigs, 80% were found within bat genomes or transcriptomes. Annotated genes are involved in a broad range of activities ranging from cellular metabolism to genome regulation through ncRNAs. Reciprocal BLAST best hits yielded 8,785 sequences that are orthologous to mouse, rat, cattle, horse and human. Species tree analysis of sequences from 2,378 loci was used to achieve 95% bootstrap support for the placement of bat as sister to the clade containing horse, dog, and cattle. Through substitution rate estimation between bat and human, 32 genes were identified with evidence for positive selection. We also identified 466 immune-related genes, which may be useful for studying Tacaribe virus infection of this species. The Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome dataset is a resource that should provide additional candidate markers for studying bat evolution and ecology, and tools for analysis of the host response and pathology of disease.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Timothy I.; Srivastava, Anuj; Chou, Wen-Chi; Liu, Liang; Hawkinson, Ann; Glenn, Travis C.; Adams, Rick; Schountz, Tony","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f3ee3dcbe6a5c393b8c017a569d3a81eb927add.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23166587/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat evolution","placement of bat","bat genomes","Annotated genes","Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome dataset","immune-related genes","Species tree analysis of sequences","horse","human","cattle","Tacaribe virus infection","potential reservoir host of Tacaribe virus","host response","transcriptome sequencing","remaining unannotated contigs","resource","cellular metabolism","lung","tools","spleen tissues","additional candidate markers","kidney","annotation","broad range of activities","mouse","arenavirus","ecology","genome regulation","South American hemorrhagic fever viruses","Reciprocal BLAST best hits","ncRNAs","Illumina platforms","clade","sister","substitution rate estimation","Artibeus jamaicensis","pathology of disease","common bats","tropical Americas","evidence","dog","loci","bootstrap support","positive selection","animal model","transcriptomes"],"language":"en"},

In 1519, the year of the arrival of the Spaniards, the population in Mexico was estimated to be between 15 and 30 million inhabitants. Eighty-one years later, in 1600, only two million remained. Epidemics (smallpox, measles, mumps), together with war, and famine have been considered to be the main causes of this enormous population loss. However, re-evaluation of historical data suggests that approximately 60\u201370% of the death toll was caused by a series of epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers of unknown origin. In order to estimate the impact of the 1576 epidemic of hemorrhagic fevers on the population we analyzed the historical record and data from the 1570 and 1580 censuses of 157 districts. The results identified several remarkable aspects of this epidemic: First, overall, the population loss for these 157 districts was 51.36%. Second, there was a clear ethnic preference of the disease, the Spanish population was minimally affected whereas native population had high mortality rate. Third, the outbreak originated in the valleys of central Mexico whence it evolved as an expansive wave. Fourth, a positive correlation between altitude and mortality in central Mexico was found. Fifth, a specific climatic sequence of events was associated with the initiation and dissemination of the hemorrhagic fevers. Although the last epidemic of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico ended in 1815, many questions remain to be answered. Perhaps the most relevant ones are whether there is a possible reemergence of the hemorrhagic fevers and how vulnerable we are to the disease.","publish_time":"2004-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acuna-Soto, Rodofo; Stahle, David W.; Therrell, Matthew D.; Griffin, Richard D.; Cleaveland, Malcolm K.","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88f4b756ad1db5e83d710f709204ceed9bdc88a8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8149aca40aad59beb8cb674a983008bdf84c264b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110390.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109704006743; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378109704006743","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["epidemic of hemorrhagic fevers","native population","Spanish population","hemorrhagic fevers of unknown origin","enormous population loss","valleys of central Mexico","disease","districts","re-evaluation of historical data","series of epidemics","historical record","high mortality rate","demographic catastrophe","altitude","parallels","mumps","main causes","initiation","Spaniards","world\u0027s history","positive correlation","possible reemergence","clear ethnic preference","specific climatic sequence of events","smallpox","measles","remarkable aspects","century","arrival","impact","dissemination","war","results","death toll","outbreak","censuses","relevant ones","expansive wave","famine","order","questions","inhabitants","years"],"language":"en"},

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a number of biological process including inflammation response. However, whether lncRNAs participate in TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPECs) is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to analyze the profiles of lncRNAs in Mock and TGEV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell line. A total of 106 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. Many differentially expressed lncRNAs act as elements to competitively attach microRNAs (miRNAs) which target to messenger RNA (mRNAs) to mediate expression of genes that related to toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) pathways. Functional analysis of the binding proteins and the up/down-stream genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs revealed that lncRNAs were principally related to inflammatory response. Meanwhile, we found that the differentially expressed lncRNA TCONS_00058367 might lead to a reduction of phosphorylation of transcription factor p65 (p-p65) in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells by negatively regulating its antisense gene promyelocytic leukemia (PML). CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that differentially expressed lncRNAs might be involved in inflammatory response induced by TGEV through acting as miRNA sponges, regulating their up/down-stream genes, or directly binding proteins.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Xuelian; Zhao, Xiaomin; Wang, Kaili; Tang, Xiaoyi; Guo, Jianxiong; Mi, Mi; Qi, Yanping; Chang, Lingling; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad58a9c8fca5baf158c0c25aa68a08dc7265d3c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6829948.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6156-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["profiles of lncRNAs","lncRNAs act","TGEV-induced inflammation","inflammation response","receptors","TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells","inflammatory response","stream genes","TGEV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cell-jejunum","porcine intestinal epithelial cells","acute inflammation","expression of genes","binding proteins","transcription factor p65","p-p65","cell line","tumor necrosis factor","important roles","infection","Mock","number of biological process","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","NLRs","IPECs","acting","antisense gene promyelocytic leukemia","reduction of phosphorylation","generation sequencing","technology","PML","TNF","BACKGROUND","elements","toll","TLRs","NOD","noncoding RNAs","study","miRNAs","microRNAs","NGS","mRNAs","Functional analysis","miRNA sponges","RIG","RLRs","pathways","data","lncRNA TCONS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

Historically Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the commonest causes of severe pneumonia and pneumonia-related deaths in young children, but this is changing with the introduction of highly effective conjugate vaccines and socio-economic development. The relative contribution of viruses and atypical bacteria appear to be increasing and traditional case management approaches may require revision to accommodate increased uptake of conjugated vaccines in the Western Pacific region.

A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Questionnaires were given to faculty, students and staff to understand their baseline knowledge. After the sessions, faculty, students and staff were asked about what was learned through the sessions, and what educational needs still needed to be addressed. Approval was sought and received by the Ethics Committee for the College of Nursing. Participants completed informed consent forms and the voluntary nature of the study was explained. RESULTS: The total number of people attending the education sessions was133, including 65 students. 18 faculty members attended and 57 support staff. Data was gathered on gaps in participant knowledge and a plan was developed to address the gaps. Policies were established around student participation in clinical and return to work practices for staff with any symptoms. CONCLUSION: In hospitals there is above average risk for exposure to infectious diseases. Student nurses travel between hospital and university, with the capacity to act as a conduit of pathogens to large, susceptible populations. Nursing colleges must respond thoroughly to protect students and staff and prevent spread of disease into the university community in the midst of an epidemic.","publish_time":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stirling, Bridget V; Harmston, Jennie; Alsobayel, Hana","journal":"BMC Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88e8809f280ef47d36f3e56b7f8558c303f36742.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4405869.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-015-0065-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25904821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Task Force","Princess Nourah University, Kingdom"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["nursing staff","faculty staff","nursing students","nursing faculty","support staff","College of Nursing academic staff","Nursing colleges","faculty members","gaps","mandatory information sessions","university community","educational needs","Princess Nourah University","education sessions was133","response","information settings","MERS-CoV Task Force","learning needs","emotional needs of participants","MERS- CoV","participant knowledge","baseline knowledge","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","intense information seminar","spread of disease","student participation","unfolding epidemic","possible disease transmission","informed consent forms","Student nurses travel","Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","emerging issue","average risk","voluntary nature","total number of people","programme","work practices","conduit of pathogens","exposure","infectious diseases","BACKGROUND","plan","place","susceptible populations","hospitals","RESULTS","world","email","letters","symptoms","midst","capacity","METHODS","Ethics Committee","posters","study","Policies","Data","Questionnaires","CONCLUSION","aim","Approval"],"language":"en"},

In this study chicks and old hens were infected by oculo-nasal route with Italy 02 serotype. Clinical signs, gross and microscopic findings were evaluated, viral nucleic acid detection was assessed by in situ hybridization (ISH) in several tissues and viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in trachea, kidney and nasal and cloacal swabs. Italy 02 serotype was demonstrated to cause severe respiratory and renal damage in one-day old chicks but not in adult hens in which only respiratory disease and drop in egg production was observed. The use of ISH technique demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in nasal turbinates prior to trachea, but more consistent and longer replication periods in enterocytes of lower gastrointestinal tract. The detection of viral nucleic acid in gut by RT-PCR was consistent and more persistent viral shedding was detected in faeces than in nasal exudates.

Therefore, the development of a sensitive, specific, and easily-performed assay is crucial for the rapid detection and surveillance of PHE-CoV infection and transmission. RESULTS: An immunochromatographic strip was developed for the detection of PHE-CoV. The colloidal gold-labeled MAb 4D4 was used as the detection reagent, and the MAb 1E2 and goat anti-mouse IgG coated the strip\u0027s test and control lines, respectively. The immunochromatographic strip was capable of specifically detecting PHE-CoV with a HA unit of 2 within 10 min. Storage of the strips at room temperature for 6 months or at 4\u00B0C for 12 months did not change their sensitivity or specificity. Using RT-PCR as a reference test, the relative specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip were determined to be 100% and 97.78%, respectively. There was an excellent agreement between the results obtained by RT-PCR and the immunochromatographic strips (kappa = 0.976). Additionally, there was a strong agreement between the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic strips (Kappa = 0.976). When the immunochromatographic strips were used for diagnosing PHE-CoV infection in the Jilin Province, the PHE-CoV-positive rate ranged from 61.54% in the Jilin district to 17.95% in the Songyuan district. CONCLUSIONS: Based on its high specificity, sensitivity, and stability, the immunochromatographic strip would be suitable for on-site detection of PHE-CoV for surveillance and epidemiological purposes.","publish_time":"2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Keyan; Zhao, Kui; Song, Deguang; He, Wenqi; Gao, Wei; Zhao, Chuanbo; Wang, Chengli; Gao, Feng","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d4de01a6f9ad02ac0939d54713c209153fa66df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3508965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22920192/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHE"],"locations":["Jilin","Songyuan"],"keyphrases":["immunochromatographic strips","surveillance of PHE","on-site detection of PHE","diagnosing PHE-CoV infection","incidence of PHE","sensitivity","rapid detection","detection reagent","relative specificity","RT-PCR","high specificity","months","RESULTS","kappa","Jilin district","strip\u0027s test","MAb 1E2","reference test","MAb 4D4","Jilin Province","strong agreement","excellent agreement","Songyuan district","sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","goat anti-mouse IgG","ELISA","stability","great economic losses","pig industry","Storage","room temperature","control lines","epidemiological purposes","HA unit","colloidal gold","countries","pigs","positive rate","transmission","development","rise","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptance of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are reviewed. Historic objections are slowly being taken apart, and an accelerated introduction of molecular diagnostics is being pursued in many cases. Clear improvement in clinical testing is achieved by introducing molecular tests. Therefore, swift introduction of such tests into clinical practice is important to be pursued. Several PCR tests show increased sensitivity, excellent specificity, and cost effectiveness highlighting the success of the novel applications in the field of bacterial infections. Finally, some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptation of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are also reviewed.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Belkum, Alex","journal":"Molecular Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f8063a4fcae4d6d4250e06553a53e249cb4e14d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150202.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123745378000304; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123745378000304","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular tests","Nucleic acid-based tests","availability of molecular diagnostics","PCR tests","molecular procedures","accelerated introduction of molecular diagnostics","current state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics","general acceptance of nucleic acid-mediated detection","general acceptation of nucleic acid-mediated detection","identification of microbial pathogens","replacement of conventional tests","identification of microorganisms","clinical testing","clinical practice","problems","routine clinical microbiology laboratories","medical microbiology","swift introduction","comparative genomics","excellent specificity","increasing speed","increased sensitivity","novel applications","cost effectiveness","panacea","understanding of infectious disease","success","chapter","field of bacterial infections","coming years","Clear improvement","momentum","Publisher Summary","Historic objections","cases"],"language":"en"},

Because it is a subclinical infection in camels, epidemiological measures other than prevalence are challenging to assess. This study estimated the force of infection (FOI) of MERS-CoV in camel populations from age-stratified serological data. A cross-sectional study of MERS-CoV was conducted in Kenya from July 2016 to July 2017. Seroprevalence was stratified into four age groups: \u003C1, 1\u20132, 2\u20133 and \u003E3 years old. Age-independent and age-dependent linear and quadratic generalised linear models were used to estimate FOI in pastoral and ranching camel herds. Models were compared based on computed AIC values. Among pastoral herds, the age-dependent quadratic FOI was the best fit model, while the age-independent FOI was the best fit for the ranching herd data. FOI provides an indirect estimate of infection risk, which is especially valuable where direct estimates of incidence and other measures of infection are challenging to obtain. The FOIs estimated in this study provide important insight about MERS-CoV dynamics in the reservoir species, and contribute to our understanding of the zoonotic risks of this important public health threat.","publish_time":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardner, E.

The aerosol size was measured using an Andersen sampler. Eight first stage HEPA filters (numbered 1\u20138) were distributed in contaminated labs and exhausts from each of the first stage HEPA filters were aggregated and filtered through one second stage HEPA filter before being released to the environment. In total, 8 first-stage and 1 second-stage HEPA filters from the BSL-3 air purification system were analyzed. No S. marcescens was detected in first stage filters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 and the second stage HEPA filter. The filtration efficiencies against aerosolized S. marcescens were \u003E99.9999%. First stage filter numbers 3 and 6 had filtration efficiencies of 99.9825% and 99.9906%, respectively. When filter number 3 was replaced by a new filter and the bracket for filter number 6 was sealed, no aerosolized S. marcescens was detected in the filtered air. Our work suggests that the BSL-3 laboratory HEPA filter air purification system is effective against bacterial aerosols, with little to no bacterial leakage into the environment.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Zhanbo; Yang, Wenhui; Li, Na; Wang, Jie; Hu, Lingfei; Li, Jinsong; Yin, Zhe; Zhang, Ke; Dong, Xiaokai","journal":"Particuology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27da326aad69136482c163f4ed91462e5bae61bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674200113001089; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1674200113001089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stage HEPA filters","stage filters","stage filter numbers","new filter","laboratory HEPA filter air purification system","BSL","environment","filtration efficiency","filtered air","filtration efficiencies","bacterial leakage","risk of infectious bacterial aerosols","aerosolized bacteria Serratia","laboratory high-efficiency particulate","biosafety level","bracket","exhausts","aerosol size","Andersen sampler","contaminated labs","work","total"],"language":"en"},

Since first identified in 1989, HCV has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide. Mostly chronic hepatitis C virus has a uniform natural history, from liver cirrhosis to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the other hand, HCV-related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. However, posttransplant HCV re-infection of the graft has been reported to be universal. Furthermore, the graft after HCV re-infection often results in accelerated progression to liver failure. In addition, treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapies. Taken together, poor outcome after HCV re-infection, regardless of grafts or recipients, poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding HCV re-infection after transplant: risk factors, current therapeutics for HCV in different stages of liver transplantation, cellular function of HCV proteins, and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry.

The aim of the present study was to develop a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, based on the TaqMan technology, for the rapid and unambiguous characterisation of all bovine pestiviruses, including the emerging HoBi-like strains. The assay was found to be sensitive, specific and repeatable, ensuring detection of as few as 100\u2013101 viral RNA copies. No cross-reactions between different pestiviral species were observed even in samples artificially contaminated with more than one pestivirus. Analysis of field samples tested positive for BVDV-1, BVDV-2 or HoBi-like virus by a nested PCR protocol revealed that the developed TaqMan assay had equal or higher sensitivity and was able to discriminate correctly the viral species in all tested samples, whereas a real-time RT-PCR assay previously developed for HoBi-like pestivirus detection showed cross-reactivity with few high-titre BVDV-2 samples.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mari, Viviana; Losurdo, Michele; Lucente, Maria Stella; Lorusso, Eleonora; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Patruno, Giovanni; Buonavoglia, Domenico; Decaro, Nicola","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/173f80b9821ac71513911c017fd60d0029ba2d48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709100/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415003870; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.12.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415003870","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine pestiviruses","emerging pestiviruses","emerging HoBi","tested samples","developed TaqMan assay","Abstract HoBi","multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay","pestiviruses infecting cattle","bovine viral diarrhea virus","high-titre BVDV","Analysis of field samples","pestivirus detection","nested PCR protocol","viral RNA copies","rapid discrimination","cross-reactivity","TaqMan technology","cross-reactions","different pestiviral species","molecular tools","recent years","higher sensitivity","widespread distribution","unambiguous characterisation","clinical forms","present study","aim","consequence","strains"],"language":"en"},

We discuss the practical and technical aspects of preparation for a remote conversation and review some differences, limitations, and advantages of these discussions. The greatest challenge with the medium is the loss of the ability to read and display nonverbal cues. Vigilant attention to proven communication strategies and solicitation of patient involvement with the discussion can allow the care provider to display empathy at a distance.

Transmission dynamics models are well suited to address infectious disease scenarios that do not conform to these assumptions. For example, these models easily account for changes in the incidence rates of infection as the proportions of susceptible and infectious persons change in the population. Fundamental concepts relating to these methods, such as the basic reproductive number, the effective reproductive number and the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental models, are reviewed. In addition, comparisons and contrasts are made between the following concepts: microparasites and macroparasites, deterministic and stochastic models, difference and differential equations and homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing patterns.

According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists\u0027 intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception.

Electro-netting overcomes the bottleneck problem of electrospinning technique and provides a versatile method for generating spider-web-like nano-nets with ultrafine fiber diameter less than 20nm. Nano-nets, supported by the conventional electrospun nanofibers in the nano-fiber/nets (NFN) membranes, exhibit numerious attractive characteristics such as extremely small diameter, high porosity, and Steiner tree network geometry, which make NFN membranes optimal candidates for many significant applications. The progress made during the last few years in the field of ESN is highlighted in this review, with particular emphasis on results obtained in the author\u2019s research units. After a brief description of the development of the electrospinning and ESN techniques, several fundamental properties of NFN nanomaterials are addressed. Subsequently, the used polymers and the state-of-the-art strategies for the controllable fabrication of NFN membranes are highlighted in terms of the ESN process. Additionally, we highlight some potential applications associated with the remarkable features of NFN nanostructure.

The goal of these models is to account for rate variation among lineages, such that they are assumed to be adequate descriptions of the processes that generated the data. A common approach for selecting a clock model for a data set of interest is to examine a set of candidates and to select the model that provides the best statistical fit. However, this can lead to unreliable estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate. For this reason, a method of evaluating absolute model performance is critical. We describe a method that uses posterior predictive simulations to assess the adequacy of clock models. We test the power of this approach using simulated data and find that the method is sensitive to bias in the estimates of branch lengths, which tends to occur when using underparameterized clock models. We also compare the performance of the multinomial test statistic, originally developed to assess the adequacy of substitution models, but find that it has low power in identifying the adequacy of clock models. We illustrate the performance of our method using empirical data sets from coronaviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, killer whales, and marine turtles. Our results indicate that methods of investigating model adequacy, including the one proposed here, should be routinely used in combination with traditional model selection in evolutionary studies. This will reveal whether a broader range of clock models to be considered in phylogenetic analysis.","publish_time":"2015-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duch\u00EAne, David A.; Duch\u00EAne, Sebastian; Holmes, Edward C.; Ho, Simon Y.W.","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a42422a5b5e8f186a97620ed42c17fe71e9c2983.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msv154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26163668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adequacy of clock models","Molecular clock models","underparameterized clock models","model adequacy","candidate models","adequacy of substitution models","broader range of clock models","absolute model performance","simulated data","traditional model selection","empirical data sets","evolutionary rates","evolutionary studies","unreliable estimates","common approach","low power","set of candidates","estimates of branch lengths","multinomial test statistic","coronaviruses","simian immunodeficiency virus","killer whales","bias","posterior predictive simulations","timescales","nucleotide sequences","combination","marine turtles","processes","best statistical fit","rate variation","methods","phylogenetic analysis","adequate descriptions","lineages","reason","results","goal"],"language":"en"},

Adaptations and improvements over that time frame have led to the development of multiplex assays. However, limitations in terms of available fluorophores has meant the number of assays which can be combined has remained in single figures. This latter limitation has led to the focus tending to be on individual pathogens and their detection. This chapter describes the development of TaqMan\u00AE Array Cards (TACs), technology which allows the detection of multiple pathogens (up to 48 targets) from a single nucleic acid extract, utilising small volumes and real-time PCR. This in turn lends itself to a syndromic approach to infectious disease diagnosis. Using the examples of TACs we have developed in our own laboratory, as well as others, we explain the design, optimisation and use of TACs for respiratory, gastrointestinal and liver infections.

SPINT2 treatment resulted in the cleavage and fusion inhibition of full-length influenza A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) HA, A/Aichi/68 (H3N2) HA, A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) HA and HMPV F when activated by trypsin, recombinant matriptase or KLK5. We also demonstrate that SPINT2 was able to reduce viral growth of influenza A/CA/04/09 H1N1 and A/X31 H3N2 in cell culture by inhibiting matriptase or TMPRSS2. Moreover, inhibition efficacy did not differ whether SPINT2 was added at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection.

The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as \u03B2-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC(50) = 0.64 \u03BCg/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC(50) values against virus yield were 1.52 \u03BCM and 2.60 \u03BCM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin (IC(50) = 0.06 \u03BCM) and indigodole B (IC(50) = 2.09 \u03BCM) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well. This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of S. cusia leaf methanol extract that acted against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. The results specify that tryptanthrin possesses antiviral potential against HCoV-NL63 infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Yu-Chi; Lee, Chia-Lin; Yen, Hung-Rong; Chang, Young-Sheng; Lin, Yu-Ping; Huang, Su-Hua; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Biomolecules","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175275.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10030366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32120929/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Strobilanthes"],"organizations":["CPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cusia leaf methanol extract","HCoV-NL63 infection","NL63 replication","indigodole B","Human coronavirus NL63 infection","Strobilanthes cusia","\u03BCM","anti-Human coronavirus NL63","virus yield","late stages of HCoV","potent antiviral activity","chemical components","major components","CPE","antiviral potential","antiviral action","progeny virus production","strong virucidal activity","study","treatment of respiratory virus infections","concentration-dependent manner","cell-type independent manner","key active component","papain","Kuntze","\u03B2-sitosterol","aR-ethyltryptanthrin","immunocompromised individuals","viral RNA genome synthesis","cytopathic effect","Chinese herbal medicine","addition","Nees","indirubin","betulin","young children","protease","removal assay","diverse biological activities","values","Different modes of time","results","infected cells","elderly","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

With the incorporation of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugated immunomagnetic beads, target influenza A viral particles such as A/H(1)N(1) and A/H(3)N(2) can be specifically recognized and are bound onto the surface of the immunomagnetic beads from the specimen sample. This is followed by labeling the fluorescent signal onto the virus-bound magnetic complexes by specific developing mAb with R-phycoerythrin (PE). Finally, the optical intensity of the magnetic complexes can be analyzed immediately by the optical detection module. Significantly, the limit of detection (LOD) of this immunomagnetic bead-based microfluidic system for the detection of influenza A virus in a specimen sample is approximately 5 \u00D7 10(\u22124) hemagglutin units (HAU), which is 1024 times better than compared to conventional bench-top systems using flow cytometry. More importantly, the entire diagnostic protocol, from the purification of target viral particles to optical detection of the magnetic complexes, can be automatically completed within 15 min in this immunomagnetic bead-based microfluidic system, which is only 8.5% of the time required when compared to a manual protocol. As a whole, this microfluidic system may provide a powerful platform for the rapid diagnosis of influenza A virus infection and may be extended for diagnosis of other types of infectious diseases with a high specificity and sensitivity.","publish_time":"2011-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lien, Kang-Yi; Hung, Lien-Yu; Huang, Tze-Bin; Tsai, Yi-Che; Lei, Huan-Yao; Lee, Gwo-Bin","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127465.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566311001448; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566311001448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21466957/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microfluidic system","rapid detection of influenza","magnetic complexes","new immunomagnetic bead","optical detection module","target influenza","virus infection","limit of detection","rapid diagnosis of influenza","conjugated immunomagnetic beads","optical intensity","optical analysis","specimen sample","purification of target viral particles","entire diagnostic protocol","fluorescent immunoassay","fluorescent signal","manual protocol","specific developing mAb","simple two-step diagnostic process","R-phycoerythrin","powerful platform","types of infectious diseases","conventional bench","high specificity","systems","incorporation of monoclonal antibody","end","FIA","LOD","flow cytometry","HAU","times","sensitivity","study","hemagglutin units","surface"],"language":"en"},

Data collected through active surveillance of Vietnamese live bird markets (LBMs) between 2011 and 2015 were used to explore and compare the spatiotemporal distributions of H5N1- and H5N6-positive LBMs. Conditional autoregressive models were developed to quantify spatiotemporal associations between agroecological factors and the two HPAI strains using the same set of predictor variables. Unlike H5N1, which exhibited a strong north\u2013south divide, with repeated occurrence in the extreme south of a cluster of high-risk provinces, H5N6 was homogeneously distributed throughout Vietnam. Similarly, different agroecological factors were associated with each strain. Sample collection in the months of January and February and higher average maximum temperature were associated with higher likelihood of H5N1-positive market-day status. The likelihood of market days being positive for H5N6 increased with decreased river density, and with successive Rounds of data collection.

Herc5, the major E3 enzyme for ISG15, mediates the ISGylation of over 300 proteins in interferon-stimulated cells. In addressing this broad substrate selectivity of Herc5, we found that: 1) the range of substrates extends even further and includes many exogenously expressed foreign proteins, 2) ISG15 conjugation is restricted to newly synthesized pools of proteins, and 3) Herc5 is physically associated with polyribosomes. These results lead to a model for ISGylation in which Herc5 broadly modifies newly synthesized proteins in a co-translational manner. This represents a novel mechanism for conjugation of a Ubl and further suggests that, in the context of an interferon-stimulated cell, newly translated viral proteins may be primary targets of ISG15. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that ISGylation of human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid protein has a dominant-inhibitory effect on the infectivity of HPV16 pseudoviruses.","publish_time":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Durfee, Larissa A.; Lyon, Nancy; Seo, Kyungwoon; Huibregtse, Jon M.","journal":"Molecular Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d344ef3c60745514da727eac948f003359a83a07.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ebdc225cd3c8c8a47ffc846877251933214e0485.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b8a8302ef5e1e59f887533ec3e9d781103295d49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2887317.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1097276510003370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510003370; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2010.05.002; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2887317?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthesized proteins","foreign proteins","ISG15 conjugation","translated viral proteins","synthesized pools of proteins","interferon-stimulated cells","primary targets of ISG15","Ubl","broad substrate selectivity of Herc5","ISGylation of human papillomavirus","L1 capsid protein","anti-viral ubiquitin","dominant-inhibitory effect","major E3 enzyme","infectivity of HPV16 pseudoviruses","co-translational manner","novel mechanism","context","model","results","range of substrates","polyribosomes"],"language":"en"},

The development of prophylactics and therapeutics is urgently needed to prevent and control MERS-CoV infections. In this study, a bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed, and gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles were used as substrates to externally bind to the MERS-CoV RBD through a protein anchor (PA). The designs included different numbers of lysin motif (LysM) repeats in the PAs linked by linkers (RBD-linker-PA2 (RLP(2)), RBD-linker-PA3 (RLP(3)) and RBD-PA3 (RP(3))), and three LysM repeats and a linker in the fusion proteins increased the binding activity to the RBD. The specific immune responses were tested by intranasally immunizing mice with RLP(3)-GEM with or without the adjuvant GEL01. The results showed that GEL01-adjuvanted RLP(3)-GEM increased the systemic humoral, cellular and local mucosal immune responses in the mouse model, especially in the intestinal tract.

One hundred and sixty-three consecutive patients who underwent non-T-cell-depleted allo-HSCT and met the criterion of LOHC after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. The median time from allo-HSCT to the occurrence of LOHC was 29 (range, 4\u2013155) days. Pathogens identified in blood and/or urine samples from 143 patients were mostly viruses. All of the patients with LOHC received intravenous fluid hydration, alkalization, and forced diuresis, of which 2 patients achieved complete remission (CR) after these treatments. The remaining 161 patients received anti-infection therapies and 71 achieved CR after the therapies. Corticosteroids were additionally applied to 83 out of 90 patients who did not achieve CR after anti-infection therapies, and 88.0% (n = 73) of them showed a grade 3 to 4 LOHC at the beginning of corticosteroid therapy. Thirty-five patients showed an immediate response (CR or downgraded at least one grade) within 1 week after the beginning of the corticosteroid therapy. Sixty-four patients (77.1%) achieved CR after corticosteroid therapy, and the median period from the beginning of corticosteroid therapy to CR was 17 days. Thus, we observed that viruses were the most common pathogens in LOHC after allo-HSCT and that anti-infection therapies were critical.

More recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents. The introduction of a targeted mutation in the IL2 receptor common gamma chain gene (IL2rg(null)) in mice already deficient in T and B cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells, as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues, effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice. These humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and other human-specific infectious agents. However, there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents. This is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies, which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice, including; i) modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity, which impedes human cell engraftment; ii) genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function; iii) and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols.

To test this concept, artificial positive controls (APCs) for use in PCR were synthesized to contain primer sequences targeting four viruses (Barley yellow dwarf virus, Soilborne wheat mosaic virus, Triticum mosaic virus and Wheat streak mosaic virus) pathogenic to wheat and, as internal control, the plant mitochondrial nad5 gene.

Sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORF) corresponding to the peplomer (S), envelope (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and an ORF for a novel 1.2 kb gene located between the M and N genes. This new gene was identical in nucleotide sequence to the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of BRV-2. With the exception of this new ORF, BRV-1 manifests 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV) in the 7.5 kb region from the 3\u2032 end of the genome that contains the genes for the structural proteins. A 504 base segment containing the ORF for the BRV-1 N gene was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system.

By immunoelectron microscopy, it was shown to aggregate broken but not intact torovirus particles from BTV-positive fecal specimens. By immunoblot, the hyperimmune serum reacted specifically with the 20 kD N proteins of both BTV and HTV, as well as with the expressed N protein.

This assay measures PR activity as a function of the resonance energy transfer (RET) between a donour molecule [humanized sea pansy Renilla reniformis luciferase (hRLuc)] and an energy acceptor molecule, humanized green fluorescent protein (hGFP2) when expressed in mammalian cells. This is a naturally occurring phenomenon and is an emerging and powerful technology that has significant advantages over alternative in vitro PR assays. The HIV-1 Gag-p2/Gag-p7 (p2/p7) PR site was inserted between hGFP2 and hRLuc. The newly created vector, hRLuc-p2/p7-hGFP2 was co-expressed with an HIV-1 codon-optimized PR\u002B or PR\u2212 Gag/Pol expressor. Expression of the hRLuc-p2/p7-hGFP2 alone or with the PR\u2212 Gag-Pol expressor generated a BRET2 indicating that the PR cleavage site was not cleaved, whereas the inclusion of the PR\u002B Gag-Pol produced a significant reduction in the BRET2. The inclusion of PR inhibitors Saquinavir or Amprenavir, or the expression of a p2/p7 PR substrate mutant also blocked the cleavage to result in a stable BRET2 signal. Because the HIV-1 auxiliary protein Vif has been shown to modulate the HIV-1p2/p7 cleavage, this assay was then validated in studies in which Vif was expressed. When Vif was overexpressed along with hRLuc-p2/p7-hGFP2 and PR\u002B Gag-Pol, the decrease in BRET2 was abrogated in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that supraphysiologic levels of Vif block p2/p7 cleavage. An accumulation of a Gag processing intermediate was observed, indicating that p2/p7 cleavage was negatively affected. Overexpression of an RNA-binding-defective Staufen protein or a related dsRNA-binding protein TRBP had no effect on PR cleavage activity as shown by Western and BRET2 analyses. The p2/p7 processing data were confirmed by Western blot analyses. BRET is non-invasive and occurs within live cells, is measured in real time, and is not restricted to cellular compartments making it an especially attractive technology to identify small bioactive inhibitory molecules. This PR BRET2 biosensor assay can be adapted for high throughput screening of new HIV-1 PR inhibitors. It can be employed to screen for antiviral compounds that also target the proteases of other viruses.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Kimberly; Cl\u00E9ment, Jean-Francois; Abrahamyan, Levon; Strebel, Klaus; Bouvier, Michel; Kleiman, Lawrence; Mouland, Andrew J.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f674866aa5bbc42a31e8b8f84e79ea98142a518e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112859.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340500131X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340500131X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gag-p7","PR site","Gag-p2","PR assays","PR cleavage activity","p7 cleavage","PR cleavage site","p7-hGFP2","hRLuc-p2","p7 PR substrate mutant","PR BRET2 biosensor assay","assay measures PR activity","codon-optimized PR","inclusion of PR inhibitors Saquinavir","p7 processing data","Gag-Pol expressor","BRET2 analyses","HIV-1p2","Gag processing intermediate","supraphysiologic levels of Vif block p2","auxiliary protein Vif","stable BRET2 signal","humanized green fluorescent protein","defective Staufen protein","sensitive reporter assay","high throughput screening of new HIV","related dsRNA-binding protein TRBP","energy acceptor molecule","Western blot analyses","donour molecule","attractive technology","significant advantages","powerful technology","significant reduction","live cells","mammalian cells","resonance energy transfer","humanized sea pansy Renilla reniformis luciferase","function","human immunodeficiency virus type","effect","Amprenavir","small bioactive inhibitory molecules","dose-dependent manner","created vector","proteases","accumulation","decrease","cellular compartments","real time","antiviral compounds","phenomenon","Overexpression","studies","viruses","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine the role and mechanism of action of polysaccharides isolated from HC (HCP) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in the mice. Materials and methods LPS was delivered by the intratracheal route to Balb/c mice 2h before HCP (40, 80 and 160mg/kg) administration. Results The number of total cells, protein and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the wet/dry weight ratio (w/d) of lungs and pulmonary pathology of each mouse were analyzed, it was found that HCP significantly alleviated ALI induced by LPS. Moreover, in lungs of mice, it was found that the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 and complement deposition were significantly decreased by HCP treatment. In vitro assays showed that C5a, a complement activation product, induced significant macrophage migration and treatment with HCP prevented it. The in vitro results also proved that LPS increased nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03B1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1\u03B2) production, and HCP antagonized these effects of LPS. It was also found that HCP alone augmented secretion of some pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion These results indicate that HCP may alleviate LPS induced lung inflammatory injury, which may be associated with its inhibitory effect on the over activation of complement and macrophages. This suggests a potential role to treat ALI.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Yan-Yan; Zhang, Yun-Yi; Ou, Ying-Ye; Lu, Xiao-Xiao; Pan, Ling-Yu; Li, Hong; Lu, Yan; Chen, Dao-Feng","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4af50c8534fa874447eb227dc762eb3f9503e62f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127486.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.07.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874115300325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190353/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874115300325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["HCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCP treatment","methods LPS","effects of LPS","induced ALI","LPS induced lung inflammatory injury","results","pro-inflammatory cytokines","TNF-\u03B1","activation of complement","lungs of mice","infiltration of inflammatory cells","complement activation product","c mice","interleukin","alleviated ALI","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","pulmonary pathology","pulmonary infections","potential role","number of total cells","protein","significant macrophage migration","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","dry weight ratio","concentrations","nitric oxide","intratracheal route","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Houttuynia cordata","Balb","polysaccharides","augmented secretion","lipopolysaccharide","expression of Toll","C5a","production","mechanism of action","receptor","folk therapy","mouse","deposition","inhibitory effect","assays","Materials","macrophages","study","Conclusion","administration"],"language":"en"},

Objective The nature of potential interactions between these risk factors was the subject of this study. Methods A community-based cohort of 198 children at high atopic risk was followed from birth to 5 years. All episodes of acute respiratory illness in the first year were recorded and postnasal aspirates were collected for viral identification. History of wheeze and asthma was collected annually, and atopy was assessed at 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years. Results A total of 815 episodes of acute respiratory illness were reported, and 33% were LRIs. Viruses were detected in 69% of aspirates, most commonly rhinoviruses (48.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (10.9%). At 5 years, 28.3%(n = 56) had current wheeze, and this was associated with wheezy [odds ratio (OR), 3.4 (1.2-9.7); P = .02] and/or febrile LRI [OR, 3.9 (1.4-10.5); P = .007], in particular those caused by respiratory syncytial virus or rhinoviruses [OR, 4.1 (1.3-12.6); P = .02]. Comparable findings were made for current asthma. Strikingly these associations were restricted to children who displayed early sensitization (\u22642 years old) and not observed in nonatopic patients or those sensitized later. Conclusion These data suggest viral infections interact with atopy in infancy to promote later asthma. Notably the occurrence of both of these events during this narrow developmental window is associated with maximal risk for subsequent asthma, which suggests a contribution from both classes of inflammatory insults to disease pathogenesis. Clinical implications Protection of \u201Chigh-risk\u201D children against the effects of severe respiratory infections during infancy may represent an effective strategy for primary asthma prevention. The potential benefits of these strategies merit more careful evaluation in this age group.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kusel, Merci M.H.; de Klerk, Nicholas H.; Kebadze, Tatiana; Vohma, Vaike; Holt, Patrick G.; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Sly, Peter D.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afe8566ab2726a0c5c0801739999194e90294a16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125611.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674907002382; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674907002382","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current asthma","later asthma","subsequent asthma","respiratory syncytial virus","children","effects of severe respiratory infections","episodes of acute respiratory illness","years old","primary asthma prevention","Background Severe lower respiratory infections","viral infections","maximal risk","high atopic risk","independent risk factors","infancy","atopic sensitization","atopy","LRIs","rhinoviruses","current wheeze","early sensitization","potential benefits","viral identification","postnasal aspirates","History of wheeze","nature of potential interactions","careful evaluation","strategies merit","effective strategy","classes of inflammatory insults","community-based cohort","contribution","narrow developmental window","events","disease pathogenesis","data","birth","Clinical implications Protection","age group","Methods","Objective","Conclusion","subject","Comparable findings","total","odds ratio","study","months","nonatopic patients","febrile LRI","occurrence","associations"],"language":"en"},

These new approaches have the potential to significantly reduce both the time and cost for infectious diseases drug discovery.","publish_time":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, G.

Our understanding of the forces driving seasonal disappearance and recurrence of infectious diseases remains fragmentary, thus limiting any predictions about whether, or when, SARS will recur. It is true that most established respiratory pathogens of human beings recur in wintertime, but a new appreciation for the high burden of disease in tropical areas reinforces questions about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity. Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute. Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza have recurred in unpredictable patterns. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with a unique ability to establish persistent infections in a minority of infected animals. Because SARS coronavirus RNA can be detected in the stool of some individuals for at least 9 weeks, recurrence of SARS from persistently shedding human or animal reservoirs is biologically plausible.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dowell, Scott F; Ho, Mei Shang","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ea7baf4740cf1cd00220d0bcec29d7828c6ff76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129396.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904011776; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904011776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recurrence of SARS","SARS coronavirus RNA","severe disease","recurrence of infectious diseases","established respiratory pathogens of human beings","shedding human","seasonal disappearance","Seasonal variation","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome","high burden of disease","emergent zoonotic diseases","established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality","ebola","tropical areas","heavy economic losses","persistent infections","unique ability","explanations","pandemic strains of influenza","wintertime","questions","Summary","cold air","new appreciation","animal reservoirs","forces","minority of infected animals","low humidity","host physiology","individuals","understanding","weeks","unpredictable patterns","complete control","stool"],"language":"en"},

Regular monitoring on preparedness of health facilities and assessment on perception of the front-line responsible health personnel has never been done. This study aimed to document the patterns of perception of health personnel toward the threat of an influenza pandemic. METHODS: Q methodology was applied to a set of 385 health personnel in charge of influenza pandemic preparedness in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand. Subjects were asked to rank 33 statements about various issues of influenza pandemic according to a pre-designed score sheet having a quasi-normal distribution on a continuous 9-point bipolar scale ranging from -4 for strongly disagree to \u002B4 for strongly agree. The Q factor analysis method was employed to identify patterns based on the similarity and dissimilarity among health personnel. RESULTS: There were three main patterns of perception toward influenza pandemic with moderate correlation coefficients between patterns ranging from 0.37 to 0.55. Pattern I, health personnel, which we labeled pessimistic, perceived themselves as having a low self-efficacy. Pattern II, which we labeled optimistic, perceived the threat to be low severity and low vulnerability. Pattern III, which we labeled mixed, perceived low self-efficacy but low vulnerability. Across the three patterns, almost all the subjects had a high expectancy that execution of recommended measures can mitigate impacts of the threat of an influenza pandemic, particularly on multi-measures with high factor scores of 4 in all patterns. The most conflicting area was vulnerability on the possible impacts of an influenza pandemic, having factor scores of high (3), low (-4), and neutral (0) for patterns I, II, and III, respectively. CONCLUSION: Strong consistent perceptions of response efficacy against an influenza pandemic may suggest a low priority to convince health personnel on the efficacy of the recommended measures. Lack of self-efficacy in certain sub-groups indicates the need for program managers to improve self-confidence of health personnel to participate in an emergency response.","publish_time":"2009-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prateepko, Tapanan; Chongsuvivatwong, Virasakdi","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f048749badc8f1c756857ceb24421f5e6c05e62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2700101.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pattern III"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["self-confidence of health personnel","low self-efficacy","low vulnerability","charge of influenza pandemic preparedness","various issues of influenza pandemic","front-line responsible health personnel","preparedness of health facilities","threat","low priority","low severity","main patterns of perception","World Health Organization effort","Lack of self-efficacy","high factor scores","factor scores of high","multi-measures","Strong consistent perceptions of response efficacy","execution of recommended measures","high expectancy","Subjects","Q factor analysis method","possible impacts","emergency response","Q methodology","southernmost provinces of Thailand","certain sub-groups","pre-designed score sheet","quasi-normal distribution","need","program managers","assessment","moderate correlation coefficients","set","statements","CONCLUSION","Regular monitoring","dissimilarity","conflicting area","bipolar scale","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

The current study was carried out to investigate the occurrence of vector-borne bacteria in the blood of dromedaries by molecular tools. A total of 200 peripheral blood samples were collected from apparently healthy animals. Microscopic examination was performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and drops of blood were spotted on Whatman FTA\u00AE cards for molecular analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cards, and PCR amplification followed by sequencing of positive samples was carried out for the detection of Anaplasmataceae, spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, Bartonella spp. and Borrelia spp. Intra-cytic forms of any blood pathogens could not be detected by light microscopy. PCR results revealed 30 animals (15%) to be infected with Anaplasmataceae bacteria. Analyses of sequences revealed a strain of Anaplasma sp. identical to Candidatus Anaplasma camelii isolated from camels, cattle and deer in Asia and Africa. Neither SFG rickettsiae, nor Borrelia or Bartonella species were found. Further studies for determining epidemiological role of camels and its zoonotic potential are recommended.

Viral infections have been shown to cause obstruction of the osteomeatal complex, which is likely to be a critical step in the development of CRS. There is clear overlap between the pathogenesis of CRS and asthma. Infections with respiratory viruses in childhood increase the risk of subsequently developing asthma. Viral infections in established asthmatics are associated with acute exacerbations. We sought to determine whether respiratory viruses could be detected within the sinonasal mucosa of CRS patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. METHODS: Sinus mucosa was sampled from 13 patients with CRS and 2 patients with normal sinuses. PCR was used to look for common respiratory viruses (parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; human metapneumovirus [hMPV]; adenovirus [ADV]; rhinovirus; coronavirus; bocavirus [BoV]; cytomegalovirus [CMV]; and influenza A and B). RESULTS: No respiratory viruses were detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSION: Persistence of respiratory viruses within the sinonasal mucosa is unlikely to be a cause of ongoing inflammation in CRS. The possibility remains that a transient viral infection provides the initial inflammatory stimulus. \u00A9 2011 ARS\u2010AAOA, LLC.","publish_time":"2011-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wood, Andrew James; Antoszewska, Hanna; Fraser, John; Douglas, Richard George","journal":"Int Forum Allergy Rhinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c342ebb61b9159055a1e4d7ace81e645fc999e4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22287325/; https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.20030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRS","LLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common respiratory viruses","Persistence of respiratory viruses","sinonasal mucosa of CRS patients","pathogenesis of CRS","development of CRS","respiratory syncytial virus","Viral infections","upper respiratory tract infection","transient viral infection","Sinus mucosa","PCR","chronic rhinosinusitis","chronic illness","cause of ongoing inflammation","polymerase chain reaction","inciting event","RSV","human metapneumovirus","BoV","rhinovirus","adenovirus","hMPV","established asthmatics","initial inflammatory stimulus","cytomegalovirus","bocavirus","coronavirus","ADV","techniques","critical step","risk","childhood","parainfluenza","osteomeatal complex","CMV","acute exacerbations","obstruction","clear overlap","possibility","BACKGROUND","normal sinuses","CONCLUSION","ARS","AAOA","LLC","METHODS","RESULTS","samples"],"language":"en"},

The recently discovered open reading frame 5 (ORF5) in PCV2 genome encodes a non-structural protein. Previous study revealed that ORF5 protein inhibits cell proliferation and may interact with host transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB). However, whether the GPNMB affects PCV2 replication and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, the transcriptome maps of PCV2-infected and ORF5-transfected porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAM) cells were profiled. The GPNMB gene was down-regulated in PCV2-infected and ORF5-transfected PAMs. By using glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and confocal microscopy approaches, we convincingly showed that PCV2 ORF5 protein interacts with GPNMB. Furthermore, by utilizing lentivirus mediated overexpression or knockdown approach, we showed that the cellular GPNMB significantly inhibits PCV2 replication and ORF5 expression. Moreover, GPNMB overexpressing leads to an increased Cyclin A expression and a reduced S phase, whereas GPNMB knockdown causes a decreased Cyclin A expression and a prolonged S phase. In conclusion, we identified a novel host factor GPNMB that interacts with PCV2 ORF5 protein and restricts PCV2 replication.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Kangkang; Xu, Lei; Wu, Mengmeng; Hou, Yufeng; Jiang, Yanfen; Lv, Jiangman; Xu, Panpan; Fan, Zhixin; Zhang, Ruiqi; Xing, Fushan; Zhang, Yanming","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae0700fe06361c6d9e2286332ba467940ec9f89e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6331448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671053/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03295","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 ORF5 protein","PCV2 replication","PCV2-infected","ORF5 expression","PCV2 genome","GPNMB knockdown","cellular GPNMB","GPNMB overexpressing","GPNMB gene","transcriptome maps of PCV2","ORF5-transfected PAMs","novel host factor GPNMB","non-structural protein","ORF5-transfected porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4","reduced S phase","prolonged S phase","glutathione S-transferase","co-IP","co-immunoprecipitation","increased Cyclin","decreased Cyclin","knockdown approach","Previous study","Porcine circovirus type","host transmembrane glycoprotein NMB","pull-down","GST","underlying molecular mechanisms","syndrome","infectious agent of postweaning multisystemic","cell proliferation","confocal microscopy approaches","lentivirus mediated overexpression","open reading frame","PMWS","cells","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

As during infection by other viruses, host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces several antiviral pathways. These include interferon (IFN), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR). Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, potently suppress the activation of these pathways, inducing only modest host responses. Our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to MERS-CoV and related viruses, NS4a and NS4b, during infection in human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells. NS4a has been previously characterized as a dsRNA binding protein, while NS4b is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to NS2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that deletion of NS4a results in increased interferon lambda (IFNL1) expression, as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear localization sequence of NS4b. All of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication. We previously reported that, like MHV NS2, NS4b antagonizes OAS-RNase L, but suppression of IFN is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases. Unexpectedly, deletion of NS4a does not result in robust activation of the PKR or OAS-RNase L pathways. Therefore, MERS-CoV likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work. This study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between MERS-CoV and the host immune response.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Comar, Courtney E.; Goldstein, Stephen A.; Li, Yize; Yount, Boyd; Baric, Ralph S.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6437052.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00319-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","OAS-RNase","antiviral pathways","deletion of NS4a results","antiviral innate immune pathways","related viruses","mutant viruses","infection","host immune response","MHV NS2","suppression of IFN","PKR","study","nuclear localization sequence of NS4b","dsRNA binding protein","modest host responses","host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA","viral phosphodiesterases","robust activation","increased interferon lambda","accessory proteins unique","protein kinase R","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel etiological agent of severe respiratory disease","IFNL1","human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells","evasion","catalytic site","enzymatic similarity","complex interactions","expression","exhibited slight decreases","mouse hepatitis virus","oligoadenylate synthetase","additional insight","unidentified function","mutation","humans","functions","important focus of future work","replication","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

There are five distinct lineages with each lineage representing a different ancestral origin. Recently, multiple reports have demonstrated the evidence of extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs, but little is known about viremia. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 532 fecal samples and 120 serum samples from healthy pigs were collected and tested from 2013 to 2015 in Guangxi province, China; of these 300/532 (56.4%) and 7/120 (5.8%) of fecal samples tested positive for PAstVs, respectively. Our study revealed that there was wide genetic diversity and high prevalence of the virus in the pig population. All five of the known PAstVs genotypes (1\u20135) prevailed in the pig population of Guangxi province and were distributed in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to sows, with PAstV2 (47.7%), PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%) seen predominantly. Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1b and partial capsid sequences from fecal and serum samples revealed that they were divided into the five lineages. Among these genotypes, based on partial ORF2 genes sequencing 23 strains were grouped as PAstV1, including 6 serum-derived strains, and were regarded as the causative agents of viremia in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the information regarding the types of PAstV in blood is limit. This is the first report for the presence of PAstV1 in blood and PAstV3 in the feces of nursery pigs of China. This study provides a reference for understanding the prevalence and genetic evolution of PAstVs in pigs in Guangxi province, China. It also provides a new perspective for understanding of the extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs in pigs.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Yifeng; Fang, Qingli; Li, Xunjie; Li, Fakai; Liu, Huan; Wei, Zuzhang; Ouyang, Kang; Chen, Ying; Huang, Weijian","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5857dd1ad48b4399458d0a8deafe47c8142217ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6935060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2217-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31881886/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangxi","China"],"keyphrases":["healthy pigs","fecal samples","serum samples","known PAstVs genotypes","genetic evolution of PAstVs","age groups of pigs","feces of nursery pigs of China","study","evidence of extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs","pig population of Guangxi province","serum-derived strains","presence of PAstV1","blood","partial capsid sequences","partial ORF2 genes","Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1b","high prevalence","distinct lineages","wide genetic diversity","causative agents of viremia","PAstV3","suckling piglets","Porcine astroviruses","different ancestral origin","information","types of PAstV","PAstV2","BACKGROUND","reference","total","multiple reports","new perspective","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","PAstV5"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or travel to Hubei before illness. The median duration, respectively, was 8 (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images. Compared to NON-NCOVID-19, NCOVID-19 present remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests including AST, ALT, \u03B3-GT, LDH and \u03B1-HBDH. CONCLUSION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused similar onsets to other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening NCOVID-19 cases. Liver function damage is more frequent in NCOVID-19 than NON-NCOVID-19 patients. LDH and \u03B1-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of NCOVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Dahai; Yao, Feifei; Wang, Lijie; Zheng, Ling; Gao, Yongjun; Ye, Jun; Guo, Feng; Zhao, Hui; Gao, Rongbao","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93faabd42092594c33a127f1f25c1d6fa709a169.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161968/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa247","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AST","LDH"],"locations":["Wuhan Hubei China"],"keyphrases":["NON-NCOVID","screening NCOVID","evaluation of NCOVID","pneumonia patients","nCoV pneumonia","nCoV infection","clinical features","clinical symptoms","\u03B1-HBDH","severe pneumonia","similar onsets","LDH","Hubei places","pneumonias","IQR","clusters illness onsets","Wuhan Hubei China","CT scan","radiological features","history of exposure","common symptoms","ground-glass opacity of chest CT images","multiple mottling","AST","\u03B3-GT","abnormal laboratory tests","reliable test","considerable markers","travel","days","Liver function damage","world concern","bilateral involvement","impacts","public health","fever","cough","sputa","novel coronavirus","real-time RT-PCR","cases","difference","throat swabs","BACKGROUND","study","demographic","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS","median duration"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Two quantitative automated immunoassays (Maglumi(TM) 2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. RESULTS: Maglumi(TM) IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4% versus 64.3%). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99% and 100%, respectively. The two tests showed similar specificity for IgG at 99% and 100%, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70%) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91% to 94%) after 14 days. CONCLUSION: This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Isabel, Montesinos; Damien, Gruson; Benoit, Kabamba; Hafid, Dahma; Sigi, Van den Wijngaert; Soleimani, Reza; Vincenzo, Carbone; Olivier, Vandenberg; Beatrice, Gulbis; Fleur, Wolff; Hector, Rodriguez-Villalobos","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198434.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403010/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Euroimmun IgG/IgA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["n-Cov IgG","lateral flow tests","lateral flow assays","Euroimmun IgG","IgM tests","lateral flow rapid tests","similar specificities of IgG","IgA assays","Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV","Control non-SARS-CoV","serological quantitative assays","detection of SARS","onset of COVID","Days","serological antibody assays","onset of symptoms","similar values","similar specificity","overall sensitivity","TM","Maglumi","patients","quantitative automated immunoassays","symptom onset","Case serum samples","retrospective study","RESULTS","antibodies","anonymous stored residual serum samples","residual sera","equivalent performance","IgA test","CLIA","ELISA","specific clinical contexts","epidemiological strategies","unambiguous coloured reading bands","RT-qPCR","application","healthy volunteers","week","CT-scan","METHODS","medical records","CONCLUSION","pandemic","INTRODUCTION","significant differences","purpose"],"language":"en"},

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3\u0027-to-5\u0027 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-\u03B2) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-\u03B2 gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-\u03B2-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-\u03B2 pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.","publish_time":"2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Case, James Brett; Li, Yize; Elliott, Ruth; Lu, Xiaotao; Graepel, Kevin W.; Sexton, Nicole R.; Smith, Everett Clinton; Weiss, Susan R.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d690de86ca6e200f4f9cac61b004e47ad753aae.json; document_parses/pdf_json/01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/182196","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV ExoN","MHV ExoN activity","virus replication","innate immune response","viral RNA sequence","viral RNA levels","efficient viral replication","innate immune antagonists","high-fidelity replication","positive-sense RNA viruses","IFN-\u03B2 pretreated cells","IFN-\u03B2 gene expression","antiviral state","exoribonuclease activity","RNA modification act","dsRNA replication intermediates","interferon beta","antiviral mechanisms","BMMs","CoV non-structural protein","interferon alpha","relative fitness","proofreading function","beta receptor deficient","numerous mammalian","specific infectivity","wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages","resistance","avian species","IFNAR","cellular pretreatment","host","lethal disease","presence","arenaviruses","humans","nsp14","dose-dependent manner","CoVs","hypothesis","data","order Nidovirales","subsequent infection","Coronaviruses","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. Methods This prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan. We prospectively identified adult patients (aged \u226518 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data. The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission. The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation. Findings Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51\u201372), 171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%) patients had obesity. As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9\u201328), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy. The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1\u20136). In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1\u00B731 [1\u00B709\u20131\u00B757] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1\u00B776 [1\u00B708\u20132\u00B786]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2\u00B794 [1\u00B748\u20135\u00B784]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1\u00B711 [95%CI 1\u00B702\u20131\u00B720] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1\u00B710 [1\u00B701\u20131\u00B719] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Interpretation Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.

METHODS: This study included children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies and respiratory symptoms, in whom a multiplex PCR test was performed. Patients in whom RVI was identified and not identified were categorized into Groups I and II, respectively. Group I was sub-divided into patients with upper and lower respiratory infections. The medical records of the enrolled patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 93 respiratory illnesses were included. Group I included 46 (49.5%) cases of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) upper and 15 (32.6%) lower respiratory infections. Rhinovirus (37.0%) was the most common viral pathogen. Significantly more patients in Group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p\u003C0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) than those in Group II.

Virulent NDV strains (GM) induce large quantities of interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2), which is the central mediator of the inflammatory reaction. Excessive expression of IL-1\u03B2 exacerbates inflammatory damage. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced IL-1\u03B2 expression can aid in further understanding the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease. Here, we showed that anti-IL-1\u03B2 neutralizing antibody treatment decreased body temperature and mortality following infection with virulent NDV. We further explored the primary molecules involved in NDV-induced IL-1\u03B2 expression from the perspective of both the host and virus. This study showed that overexpression of NLRP3 resulted in increased IL-1\u03B2 expression, whereas inhibition of NLRP3 or caspase-1 caused a significant reduction in IL-1\u03B2 expression, indicating that the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis is involved in NDV-induced IL-1\u03B2 expression. Moreover, ultraviolet-inactivated GM (chicken/Guangdong/GM/2014) NDV failed to induce the expression of IL-1\u03B2. We then collected virus from GM-infected cell culture supernatant using ultracentrifugation, extracted the viral RNA, and stimulated the cells further with GM RNA. The results revealed that RNA alone was capable of inducing IL-1\u03B2 expression. Moreover, NLRP3/caspase-1 was involved in GM RNA-induced IL-1\u03B2 expression. Thus, our study elucidated the critical role of IL-1\u03B2 in the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease while also demonstrating that inhibition of IL-1\u03B2 via anti-IL-1\u03B2 neutralizing antibodies decreased the damage associated with NDV infection; furthermore, GM RNA induced IL-1\u03B2 expression via NLRP3/caspase-1.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Pei; Chen, Libin; Fan, Lei; Ren, Jinlian; Du, Haoyun; Sun, Minhua; Li, Yaling; Xie, Peng; Lin, Qiuyan; Liao, Ming; Xu, Chenggang; Ning, Zhangyong; Ding, Chan; Xiang, Bin; Ren, Tao","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e2b81ea145f20bad9129013f611181c0fe4ad8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156904.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-020-00774-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","GM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2 expression","NDV-induced IL","Excessive expression of IL","anti-IL","inhibition of IL","GM RNA-induced IL","GM RNA induced IL","increased IL","capable of inducing IL","critical role of IL","NDV infection","caspase","Virulent NDV strains","inhibition of NLRP3","Newcastle disease virus","ultraviolet-inactivated GM","viral RNA","overexpression of NLRP3","pathogenesis of Newcastle disease","contagious disease","GM-infected cell culture supernatant","inflammatory damage","study","inflammatory reaction","mortality","body temperature","antibody treatment","ultracentrifugation","large quantities of interleukin","chicken","severe inflammation","Guangdong","antibodies","significant reduction","cells","perspective","axis","central mediator","primary molecules","mechanisms","host","poultry","results"],"language":"en"},

A feline calicivirus (FCV) titre was 1:320 and the initial clinical signs and laboratory findings were attributed to a coinfection with FPV and FCV. The cat was treated with interferon omega.

Two differential diagnoses for an extreme thrombocytosis are a reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a hemic neoplasia that causes a severe and persistent thrombocytosis, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Reactive thrombocytosis is generally mild to moderate and of shorter duration than described here, but an excessive response could have been caused by infection. The influence of additional factors such as an initial thrombocytopenia, age and interferon treatment are not clear but can be speculated on.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia and detect the type and diversity of human adenoviruses that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Beijing. STUDY DESIGN: An etiological study of adult community-acquired pneumonia was carried out prospectively at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. A total of 18 cases with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections in 487 cases with CAP were observed clinically. The viral type and phylogenetic analysis were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Patients with adenovirus pneumonia typically reported flu-like symptoms. Some of them developed shortness of breath or severe dyspnea on 6 days after disease onset. The patients with ARDS usually present dyspnea, higher level of serum muscle enzymes and bilateral, mutilobal consolidation and patchy/ground-glass opacities. HAdVs type was detected in 17 samples and all of them belonged to species B (HAdV-11, 7, 3 and 14). Among them, HAdV-11 was most frequently (10/17), followed by HAdV-7 (5/17). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial penton nucleotide confirmed a close relationship with stains circulating in the Beijing region. CONCLUSIONS: Our identification of severe respiratory illness due to adenovirus, especially type 11 may highlight the need for rapid diagnosis and improved surveillance, which may assist with targeted development of antiviral agents or type-specific vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Li; Liu, Zhenjia; Li, Xiaoli; Qu, Jiuxin; Guan, Wenda; Liu, Yingmei; Song, Shufan; Yu, Xiaomin; Cao, Bin","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/476db4612637dfb23fe3797a46f7215539701ae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185447.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653212001692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608839/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2012.04.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653212001692","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["HAdVs type","viral type","severe dyspnea","radiological characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia","Severe community","adenovirus infections","type-specific vaccines","ARDS","phylogenetic analysis","CAP","cases","Patients","Beijing region","identification of severe respiratory illness","diversity of human adenoviruses","present dyspnea","etiological study of adult community","STUDY DESIGN","Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital","acute respiratory distress syndrome","higher level of serum muscle enzymes","mutilobal consolidation","partial penton nucleotide","close relationship","targeted development of antiviral agents","stains","days","polymerase chain reaction","improved surveillance","immunocompetent adults","need","rapid diagnosis","ground-glass opacities","laboratory","flu","disease onset","shortness of breath","PCR","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","concerns","total","species B","symptoms","samples","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The annual frequency of respiratory illness rises during the second year of life, falls during subsequent years, increases again during child-bearing years, then decreases with advancing age (although some increase may be seen in the elderly). In terms of restriction on activity and prompting of visits to physicians, the greatest number of illnesses are associated with rhinoviruses followed by influenza viruses. However, comparing rhinovirus and influenza, there is no doubt that influenza viruses produce more severe symptoms. In some years, when there is a major influenza outbreak, they may even be identified at greater frequency. Moreover, unlike with other viruses, severity of influenza infection is high at all ages, but especially in older individuals. Influenza vaccine, which has been available for half a century, has proved effective in preventing hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza during outbreaks of influenza types A and B. The antiviral agents amantadine and rimantadine provide approximately equivalent, and significant, efficacy in protection against clinical illness resulting from influenza type A only. However, the potential for side effects is more marked with amantadine. Some studies have shown that the rate of treatment withdrawal is no greater with rimantadine than with placebo. As we enter the next century, we may well see improvements in influenza vaccines, as well as the advent of antiviral agents that are effective against both type A and type B influenza.","publish_time":"1995-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monto, Arnold S.","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcacb10cf4f14b3837a2632f269da025bc8dd0f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934399803076; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934399803076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","influenza vaccines","type B influenza","outbreaks of influenza types","severity of influenza infection","major influenza outbreak","rimantadine","antiviral agents amantadine","subsequent years","greater frequency","century","annual frequency of respiratory illness","advent of antiviral agents","clinical illness","Viral respiratory infections","leading cause of acute morbidity","visits","physicians","efficacy","ages","protection","pneumonia","greatest number of illnesses","activity","rate of treatment withdrawal","hospitalizations","rhinoviruses","doubt","year of life","severe symptoms","increase","community","effects","advancing age","child","improvements","terms of restriction","potential","older individuals","placebo","elderly","studies"],"language":"en"},

Astroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide and have been associated with encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Through comparative genomic analysis of \u003E400 astrovirus sequences, we identified a conserved \u201CORFX\u201D overlapping the capsid-encoding ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. ORFX appears to be subject to purifying selection, consistent with it encoding a functional protein product, termed XP. Using ribosome profiling of cells infected with human astrovirus 1, we confirm initiation at the ORFX AUG. XP-knockout astroviruses are strongly attenuated and after passaging can partly restore viral titer via pseudo-reversions, thus demonstrating that XP plays an important role in virus growth. To further investigate XP, we developed an astrovirus replicon system. We demonstrate that XP has only minor effects on RNA replication and structural protein production. Instead, XP associates with the plasma membrane with an extracellular N-terminus topology and promotes efficient virus release. Using two different assays, we show that expression of human or related astrovirus XPs leads to cell permeabilization, suggesting a viroporin-like activity. The discovery of XP advances our knowledge of these important human viruses and opens a new direction of research into astrovirus replication and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lulla, Valeria; Firth, Andrew E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03ce432f27c7df6af22b92245a614db2ecb5de5f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2b30355f2ce32f63872bd8beb66e8245e03974db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/661579","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["ORFX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human astroviruses","termed XP","XP-knockout astroviruses","XP associates","discovery of XP","astrovirus replication","astrovirus sequences","ORFX","important human viruses","expression of human","related astrovirus XPs","astrovirus replicon system","RNA replication","ORF2","Astroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis","important role","virus growth","small nonenveloped viruses","structural protein production","functional protein product","efficient virus release","positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes","main open reading frames","extracellular N-terminus topology","ORF1a","new direction of research","plasma membrane","minor effects","ORF1b","cell permeabilization","knowledge","viral titer","children","pseudo-reversions","capsid","initiation","comparative genomic analysis","ribosome profiling of cells","purifying selection","encephalitis","meningitis","immunocompromised individuals","viroporin","passaging","genogroup","pathogenesis","different assays","activity"],"language":"en"},

Although there is growing literature on influenza transmission at national and international scales, little attention has been paid to a city scale. This article aims to understand the spatial\u2013temporal transmission of influenza and identify its health risks in the urbanized area of Buffalo, New York. An individual-based spatially explicit model is established to replicate an urban contact network, and simulate influenza epidemics. The resulting epidemic curves and infection intensity maps are used to analyze the transmission dynamics, possible contributing factors, and high-risk places and times. The results indicate that the city-wide transmission of influenza can be described by five stages: local growth, expansion, fast city-wide growth, slow city-wide growth, and fade-out. The places and times associated with higher risk are closely related to spatial heterogeneity in the population, and travel behaviors of individuals. Interestingly, these high-risk places and times are insensitive to where infection sources are introduced. This research suggests that high-risk places can be pre-identified as control targets using census and land use data. In addition, a better understanding on the city-wide travel of individuals is critical for designing proper timelines for influenza control. These suggestions will be valuable for local health agencies as they prepare to combat new waves of H1N1 influenza.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Liang; Bian, Ling","journal":"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c806034d4e17f1e43b7415c9c906c8160622694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124201.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971510000256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287709/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2010.03.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198971510000256","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["influenza transmission","city-wide transmission of influenza","influenza control","influenza epidemics","temporal transmission of influenza","high-risk places","transmission dynamics","times","new waves of H1N1 influenza","fast city-wide growth","slow city-wide growth","city-wide travel of individuals","local growth","local health agencies","travel behaviors of individuals","control targets","urban areas","health risks","New York","spatial heterogeneity","infection sources","infection intensity maps","urban contact network","census","expansion","possible contributing factors","international scales","urbanized area of Buffalo","important role","resulting epidemic curves","population","proper timelines","land use data","little attention","better understanding","higher risk","stages","Abstract Cities","suggestions","fade-out","literature","explicit model","addition","research","results","city scale","pandemics","article"],"language":"en"},

However, the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not appear to be directly responsible for promoting the fusion of the gamete membranes, suggesting that this critical phase of the fertilization cascade requires the concerted action of alternative fusogenic machinery. It has therefore been proposed that IZUMO1 may play a secondary role in the organization and/or stabilization of higher-order heteromeric complexes in spermatozoa that are required for membrane fusion. RESULTS: Here, we show that fertilization-competent (acrosome reacted) mouse spermatozoa harbor several high molecular weight protein complexes, a subset of which are readily able to adhere to solubilized oolemmal proteins. At least two of these complexes contain IZUMO1 in partnership with GLI pathogenesis-related 1 like 1 (GLIPR1L1). This interaction is associated with lipid rafts and is dynamically remodeled upon the induction of acrosomal exocytosis in preparation for sperm adhesion to the oolemma. Accordingly, the selective ablation of GLIPR1L1 leads to compromised sperm function characterized by a reduced ability to undergo the acrosome reaction and a failure of IZUMO1 redistribution. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study characterizes multimeric protein complexes on the sperm surface and identifies GLIPRL1L1 as a physiologically relevant regulator of IZUMO1 function and the fertilization process.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaikwad, Avinash S.; Anderson, Amanda L.; Merriner, D.

To assess the correlation between the clinical severity of acute bronchiolitis, serum KL\u20106, and the causative viruses, 222 infants with acute bronchiolitis presenting at the Pediatric Emergency Department of Estaing University Hospital, Clermont\u2010Ferrand, France, were prospectively enrolled from October 2011 to May 2012. Disease severity was assessed with a score calculated from oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and respiratory effort. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected to screen for a panel of 20 respiratory viruses. Serum was assessed and compared with a control group of 38 bronchiolitis\u2010free infants. No significant difference in KL\u20106 levels was found between the children with bronchiolitis (mean 231 IU/mL \u00B1 106) and those without (230 IU/mL \u00B1 102), or between children who were hospitalized or not, or between the types of virus. No correlation was found between serum KL\u20106 levels and the disease severity score. The absence of Human Rhinovirus was a predictive factor for hospitalization (OR 3.4 [1.4\u20137.9]; P = 0.006). Older age and a higher oxygen saturation were protective factors (OR 0.65[0.55\u20130.77]; P \u003C 0.0001 and OR 0.67 [0.54\u20130.85] P \u003C 0.001, respectively). These results suggest that in infants presenting with bronchiolitis for the first time, clinical outcome depends more on the adaptive capacities of the host than on epithelial dysfunction intensity.

It is characterized by the features of acute encephalopathy such as seizure, alteration of consciousness, and symmetric involvement of the bilateral thalamus on neuroimaging tests. Although most ANE cases have occurred sporadically, familial or recurrent ANE has been reported in Caucasian patients, with genetic susceptibility to ANE noted in some patients due to a RANBP2 mutation. We report the cases of two Korean siblings with typical ANE and RANBP2 mutation. Case report A 2year-old Korean girl presented with prolonged seizures and encephalopathy after two days of febrile illness. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse brain swelling and low attenuation in the bilateral thalamus. Two months later, her younger sister presented with lethargy and flurries of seizures after a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) showed a characteristic involvement of the bilateral thalamus, suggesting ANE. Although they received intravenous steroids and immunoglobulin, the older child died; her sister remained in a coma. Both were diagnosed with familial ANE after identifying a common missense mutation in RANBP2 (c.1754C\u003ET: p.Thr585Met) in the younger sister and their father. Conclusions This report is the first case of familial ANE in Northeast Asia identifying a RANBP2 mutation with poor outcome.

This increased cooperation between worldwide regulators has necessitated proactive deliberate efforts towards convergence/harmonisation of regulation, practices and requirements to eliminate or reduce differences. Cooperation and harmonisation of standards in the pharmaceutical domain are already a reality and have become increasingly important during recent decades, with a high level of commitment to these activities by all stakeholders. The worldwide Drug Regulatory Authorities (DRAs) have been working to end an isolationist attitude that cannot resolve current worldwide issues and challenges caused by an ever increasing globalisation. As a result, many cooperation and harmonisation initiatives have been established at the bilateral, regional and global levels as a response to the changing geo-economic-political situation. The spectrum of collaboration varies from simple informal technical cooperation to full integration of systems and regulations. Indeed, all these initiatives can be very different in scope (some are part of a broader harmonisation initiative), level of harmonisation (depending on the political support/commitment), organisation (well-structured versus simple discussion) or advancement (established process vs. pilot projects), but they all work towards convergence of requirements and/or practices. All these multiple worldwide cooperation and harmonisation programmes have evolved rapidly over the past decades. This book section provides the current status of this complex and broad phenomenon of cooperation, convergence and harmonisation in the pharmaceutical sector. It reviews all major global, regional and bilateral cooperation initiatives.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lezotre, Pierre-Louis","journal":"International Cooperation, Convergence and Harmonization of Pharmaceutical Regulations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/583f2414b78d76ab9c2d411bf80f7cb99f6357d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128000533000021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128000533000021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["harmonisation initiatives","bilateral cooperation initiatives","level of harmonisation","increased cooperation","multiple worldwide cooperation","harmonisation programmes","harmonisation of regulation","harmonisation of standards","broad phenomenon of cooperation","simple informal technical cooperation","broader harmonisation initiative","basic principle of international cooperation","worldwide regulators","convergence of requirements","current worldwide issues","worldwide Drug Regulatory Authorities","duplication of efforts","multilateral efforts","activities","practices","proactive deliberate efforts","key regulatory authorities","high level of commitment","simple discussion","current status","financial resources","global levels","political support","established process","pharmaceutical domain","pharmaceutical sector","recent decades","past decades","focussing of limited resources","changing geo-economic-political situation","advancement","knowledge","response","organisation","experience","human","integration of systems","higher-risk areas of concern","pilot projects","spectrum of collaboration","challenges","DRAs","isolationist attitude","reality","book section","result","regulations","scope","stakeholders","globalisation","differences"],"language":"en"},

Recently, several studies have reported that AE also occurred in interstitial pneumonias other than IPF, such as collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial pneumonia (CVD-IP). However, the incidence of AE in CVD-IP and its clinical characteristics remain to be fully determined. This study was conducted to elucidate cumulative incidence of AE in CVD-IP and its clinical features. METHODS: We reviewed 83 biopsy-proven CVD-IP patients, estimated cumulative incidence of AE, and examined its clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 83 CVD-IP patients, six patients with a mean age of 65.7 years developed AE (overall incidence, 7.2%; 1-year incidence, 1.25%). Underlying CVDs included rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 5; overall incidence, 20.0%) and primary Sj\u00F6gren syndrome (n = 1; overall incidence, 5.9%). Patients with AE showed acute respiratory deterioration with severe hypoxemia (mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, 131). Radiologically, ground-glass opacity was superimposed on the underlying reticular abnormalities. Preexisting histological patterns included three usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and two non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Five (83.3%) of six patients died of respiratory failure despite intensive therapy. Univariate Cox\u0027s proportional hazards analysis showed that age and RA diagnosis were significantly associated with AE. Multivariate Cox\u0027s proportional hazards analysis indicated that age was an independent significant factor predicting AE. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that AE can occur in CVD-IP, and this condition is closely similar to that of IPF with poor prognosis. AE is most common in RA, and associated with higher ages.","publish_time":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suda, Takafumi; Kaida, Yusuke; Nakamura, Yutaro; Enomoto, Noriyuki; Fujisawa, Tomoyuki; Imokawa, Shiro; Hashizume, Hideo; Naito, Tateaki; Hashimoto, Dai; Takehara, Yasuo; Inui, Naoki; Nakamura, Hirotoshi; Colby, Thomas V.; Chida, Kingo","journal":"Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec27de28a7798bb361106dc060f4f43028f6cba7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172557.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19181509/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611109000055; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2008.12.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611109000055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Univariate Cox"],"organizations":["AE","RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cumulative incidence of AE","overall incidence","year incidence","biopsy-proven CVD-IP patients","IPF","acute respiratory deterioration","usual interstitial pneumonia","non-specific interstitial pneumonia","mean age","interstitial pneumonias","clinical characteristics","acute deterioration of respiratory status","respiratory failure","RA diagnosis","Acute exacerbation","clinical features","Univariate Cox\u0027s proportional hazards analysis","Multivariate Cox\u0027s proportional hazards analysis","mean PaO","Underlying CVDs","distinct condition","underlying reticular abnormalities","severe hypoxemia","idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","UIP","collagen vascular disease","rheumatoid arthritis","years","independent significant factor","histological patterns","primary Sj\u00F6gren syndrome","intensive therapy","ground-glass opacity","FiO","NSIP","BACKGROUND","poor prognosis","higher ages","CONCLUSIONS","data","study","RESULTS","METHODS","studies"],"language":"en"},

The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 by and is A\u002BT rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124\u2013847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus. It also was immunogenic; a hyperimmune serum made in guinea pigs reacted with VP1 using immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This serum did not possess neutralization activity.","publish_time":"1989-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, J.; Charpilienne, A.; Chilmonczyk, S.; Estes, M.

However, little is known about the molecular determinants required for viral replication and pathogenesis. Moreover, TAdV-3 does not grow well in cell culture, thus detailed structural studies of the infectious particle is particularly challenging. To develop a better understanding of virus-host interactions, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of proteinase K treated purified TAdV-3 virions isolated from spleens of infected turkeys, by utilizing one-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 13 viral proteins associated with TAdV-3 virions including a novel uncharacterized TaV3gp04 protein. Further, we detected 18 host proteins in purified virions, many of which are involved in cell-to cell spread, cytoskeleton dynamics and virus replication. Notably, seven of these host proteins have not yet been reported to be present in any other purified virus. In addition, five of these proteins are known antiviral host restriction factors. The availability of reagents allowed us to identify two cellular proteins (collagen alpha-1 (VI) chain and haemoglobin) in the purified TAdV-3 preparations. These results represent the first comprehensive proteomic profile of TAdV-3 and may provide information for illustrating TAdV-3 replication and pathogenesis.

The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV mediates viral entry into host cells, and correct processing and modification of GP by host factors is a prerequisite for virus replication. Here, using an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy, 591 host proteins were identified as interactors of LASV GP. Gene ontology analysis was performed to functionally annotate these proteins, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highly enriched. Functional studies conducted by using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts showed that STT3A and STT3B, the two catalytically active isoforms of the OST complex, are essential for the propagation of the recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV glycoprotein precursor, mainly via affecting virus infectivity. Knockout of STT3B, but not STT3A, caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP, indicating a preferential requirement of LASV for the STT3B-OST isoform. Furthermore, double knockout of magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) and tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3), two specific subunits of STT3B-OST, also caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and affected virus propagation. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 is essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP. NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, can effectively reduce virus infectivity without affecting cell viability. The STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation of GP is conserved among other arenaviruses, including both the Old World and New World groups. Our study provided a systematic view of LASV GP-host interactions and revealed the preferential requirement of STT3B for LASV GP N-glycosylation. IMPORTANCE Glycoproteins play vital roles in the arenavirus life cycle by facilitating virus entry and participating in the virus budding process. N-glycosylation of GPs is responsible for their proper functioning; however, little is known about the host factors on which the virus depends for this process. In this study, a comprehensive LASV GP interactome was characterized, and further study revealed that STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation was preferentially required by arenavirus GPs and critical for virus infectivity. The two specific thioredoxin subunits of STT3B-OST MAGT1 and TUSC3 were found to be essential for the N-glycosylation of viral GP. NGI-1, a small-molecule inhibitor of OST, also showed a robust inhibitory effect on arenavirus. Our study provides new insights into LASV GP-host interactions and extends the potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics against Lassa fever in the future.","publish_time":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Shenglin; Wan, Weiwei; Zhang, Yanjun; Shang, Weijuan; Pan, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Xiao, Gengfu","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b75e7f3f923023185daed6f29e5beca4eddfc109.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6854512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6854512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LASV","LASV GP.

International migration to Japan, a country with dominant ethnic homogeneity, is growing steadily amid an ageing domestic population and severe labour shortages. OBJECTIVES: To identify the contemporary barriers to, and facilitators of, mental well-being among the migrant population in Japan. DESIGN: Systematic review DATA SOURCES: PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science, Ichushi and J-Stage ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Research articles examining the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan that were published in English or Japanese between January 2000 and September 2018 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Full texts of relevant articles were screened and references of the included studies were hand-searched for further admissible articles. Study characteristics, mental well-being facilitators and barriers, as well as policy recommendations were synthesised into categorical observations and were then thematically analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies (23 published in English), surveying a total of 8649 migrants, were identified. The most commonly studied migrant nationalities were Brazilian (36%), followed by Chinese (27%) and Filipino (8%). Thematic analysis of barriers to mental well-being among migrants chiefly identified \u2018language difficulties\u2019, \u2018being female\u2019 and \u2018lack of social support\u2019, whereas the primary facilitators were \u2018social networks\u2019 followed by \u2018cultural identity\u2019. Policy recommendations for authorities generally described more migrant support services and cross-cultural awareness among the Japanese public. CONCLUSION: Access to social support networks of various types appears to be an influential factor affecting the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan. More research is necessary on how to promote such connections to foster a more inclusive and multicultural Japanese society amid rapid demographic change.

Unlike the P(S/T)AP and YPX((1\u20133))L late domains, which interact directly with the ESCRT proteins Tsg101 and ALIX, the molecular linkage connecting the PPXY late domain to ESCRT proteins is unclear. The mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein, Z, contains only one late domain, PPXY. We previously found that this domain in LCMV Z, as well as the ESCRT pathway, are required for the release of defective interfering (DI) particles but not infectious virus. To better understand the molecular mechanism of ESCRT recruitment by the PPXY late domain, affinity purification-mass spectrometry was used to identify host proteins that interact with the Z proteins of the Old World mammarenaviruses LCMV and Lassa virus. Several Nedd4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases interact with these matrix proteins and in the case of LCMV Z, the interaction was PPXY-dependent. We demonstrated that these ligases directly ubiquitinate LCMV Z and mapped the specific lysine residues modified. A recombinant LCMV containing a Z that cannot be ubiquitinated maintained its ability to produce both infectious virus and DI particles, suggesting that direct ubiquitination of LCMV Z alone is insufficient for recruiting ESCRT proteins to mediate virus release. However, Nedd4 ligases appear to be important for DI particle release suggesting that ubiquitination of targets other than the Z protein itself is required for efficient viral ESCRT recruitment.","publish_time":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziegler, Christopher M.; Dang, Loan; Eisenhauer, Philip; Kelly, Jamie A.; King, Benjamin R.; Klaus, Joseph P.; Manuelyan, Inessa; Mattice, Ethan B.; Shirley, David J.; Weir, Marion E.; Bruce, Emily A.; Ballif, Bryan A.; Botten, Jason","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/687da34d9c50dd79ad55b5067ffdbb7282c03d35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6874086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6874086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPXY","LCMV Z","DI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Z proteins","case of LCMV Z","ubiquitinate LCMV Z","recruiting ESCRT proteins","ESCRT proteins Tsg101","direct ubiquitination of LCMV Z","PPXY late domain","matrix proteins","virus release","recombinant LCMV","ESCRT pathway","host proteins","infectious virus","Viral late domains","efficient viral ESCRT recruitment","Lassa virus","molecular mechanism of ESCRT recruitment","Old World mammarenaviruses LCMV","DI particles","PPXY-dependent","Nedd4 ligases","DI particle release","mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","viral budding","release of defective interfering","Nedd4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases","molecular linkage","ubiquitination of targets","transport","affinity purification-mass spectrometry","cellular endosomal sorting complex","ALIX","interaction","membrane scission","AP","specific lysine residues","YPX","ability"],"language":"en"},

In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes.

Among eight viral RNA segments, the multiple functions of nucleoprotein (NP) play important roles in viral replication and transcription. METHODS: To understand how NP contributes to the virus evolution, we analyzed the NP gene of H3N2 viruses in Taiwan and 14,220 NP sequences collected from Influenza Research Database. The identified genetic variations were further analyzed by mini-genome assay, virus growth assay, viral RNA and protein expression as well as ferret model to analyze their impacts on viral replication properties. RESULTS: The NP genetic analysis by Taiwan and global sequences showed similar evolution pattern that the NP backbones changed through time accompanied with specific residue substitutions from 1999 to 2018. Other than the conserved residues, fifteen sporadic substitutions were observed in which the 31R, 377G and 450S showed higher frequency. We found 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity while the dominant residues (31 K and 450G) had higher activity. The 31 K and 450G showed better viral translation and replication in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated variations identified in evolution have roles in modulating viral replication in vitro and in vivo.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prior receipt of antibiotics on the microorganism distribution. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a 3200-bed tertiary, referral, teaching hospital in eastern China. During a 2-year period, all hospitalized patients treated with antimicrobial agents were enrolled in this study. Among 48,692 patients evaluated, the 27,792 (57.1%) who were sampled within 2 days before or after administration of the first dose of antimicrobial agents were included. Distribution of clinical specimens and the microorganism were compared between before and after antibiotic drug treatment groups. RESULTS: Compared to specimens taken after antibiotics exposure, specimens taken before antibiotics exposure had a higher proportion of blood and urine specimens and a higher culture positive rate (all P \u003C 0.001). Higher percentages of Staphylococcus aureus (9.9% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.041), non-fermenting bacteria (27.7% vs. 19.9%, P \u003C 0.001), and fungi (8.4% vs. 4.0%, P \u003C 0.001) were isolated from the group after antibiotics exposure, while the percentages of Streptococcus spp. (4.8% vs. 2.7%, P \u003C 0.001), Haemophilus influenzae (2.3% vs. 0.8%, P \u003C 0.001), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7% vs. 0.1%, P \u003C 0.001) were higher in the group before antibiotics exposure. Further analysis found significant differences of microbes derived from respiratory secretions, blood or urine samples. We found, after antibiotics exposure, the separation rate of non-fermenting bacteria was significantly increased (all P \u003C 0.05), and the separation rate of Candida spp. was higher, with statistical significance in airway secretion and urine samples (both P \u003C 0.05), but the separation rate of Staphylococcus aureus among the three groups was not affected by antibiotics. In addition, the isolation rate of Streptococcus spp. in blood and urine samples decreased significantly (both P \u003C 0.05) after antibiotics exposure. Interestingly, no statistical difference was found for microbes isolated from body fluid specimens between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome revealed that antibiotic-insensitive organisms such as non-fermentative bacteria and fungi were more frequently isolated after antibiotics exposure.

The study suggested that patients with HIE are unable to generate EEG slow waves during propofol anesthesia 48 h after cardiac arrest (CA). Since a low number of electrodes would make the method clinically more practical, we now investigated whether our results received with a full EEG cap could be reproduced using only forehead electrodes. Experimental data from comatose post-CA patients (N = 10) were used. EEG was recorded approximately 48 h after CA using 19-channel EEG cap during a controlled propofol exposure. The slow wave activity was calculated separately for all electrodes and four forehead electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8) by determining the low-frequency (\u003C 1 Hz) power of the EEG. HIE was defined by following the patients\u2019 recovery for six months. In patients without HIE (N = 6), propofol substantially increased (244 \u00B1 91%, mean \u00B1 SD) the slow wave activity in forehead electrodes, whereas the patients with HIE (N = 4) were unable to produce such activity. The results received with forehead electrodes were similar to those of the full EEG cap. With the experimental pilot study data, the forehead electrodes were as capable as the full EEG cap in capturing the effect of HIE on propofol-induced slow wave activity.

The design goals were for the stent to allow mucus flow and to resist migration inside the airways, while also enabling easy insertion and removal. Methods: A helical stent design, together with insertion and removal tools, is presented. A mechanics model of stent compression is derived to assist in selecting stent design parameters (pitch and wire diameter) that provide the desired amount of tracheal support, while introducing the minimal amount of foreign material into the airway. Worst-case airway area reduction with stent support is investigated experimentally using a pressurized tracheal phantom matched to porcine tracheal tissue properties. The stent design is then evaluated in a porcine in vivo experiment. Results: Phantom testing validated the mechanics model of stent compression. In vivo testing demonstrated that the stent was well tolerated by the animal. Since the helical design covers only a small portion of the epithelium, mucus transport through the stented region was minimally impeded. Furthermore, the screw-like stent resisted migration, while also providing for atraumatic removal through the use of an unscrewing motion during removal. Conclusion: The proposed stent design and tools represent a promising approach to prevent airway collapse in children with tracheobronchomalacia.

Virtually all commercially available vaccines are inactivated whole-virus vaccines produced in cell culture, but the adaptation of a field isolate of the virus to growth in culture is laborious and time-consuming. This is of particular concern for the development of vaccines to newly emerging virus lineages, where long lead times from virus isolate to vaccine can delay the implementation of effective control programs. High antigen yields in production cells are also necessary to make vaccines affordable for less developed countries in endemic areas. Therefore, a rational approach to cell culture adaptation that combines prior knowledge of common adaptive mutations and reverse genetics techniques is urgently required. This review provides an overview of amino acid exchanges in the viral capsid proteins in the context of adaptation to cell culture.

First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV\u002BNSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-\u03B3 expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.","publish_time":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Xiaocheng; Zhang, Nianzhi; Wei, Xiaohui; Jiang, Yinan; Chen, Rong; Li, Qirun; Liang, Ruiying; Zhang, Lijie; Ma, Lizhen; Xia, Chun","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78b06344bf1d834407a41bceb4999839085b0082.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6960135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6960135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide-SLA","NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation","peptide binding","restricted peptide epitopes","peptide-binding motif of SLA","identified PRRSV peptide epitope","P4 of NSP9","potential SLA","PRRSV CTL epitope","tetrameric complex of SLA","effective peptide-based vaccines","restricted CTL epitopes","CTL immunogenicity","SPF swine","known pSLA","CTL epitope applications","predicted PRRSV peptides","swine experiments","typical genetic PRRSV strains","D pocket of pSLA","MLV","strong immunogenicity","hs0202 complexes","various important viruses","flow cytometry","respiratory syndrome virus","turn","P3","alanine scanning","specific pathogen-free","IFN-\u03B3 expression","assembly","groups","biochemistry","live vaccine","crystallography","consecutive Pro residues","example","structural analysis","blank control group","integrated approach","crystal structure","study","alleles"],"language":"en"},

The capability of A. baumannii to persist and disseminate between healthcare settings has raised a major concern worldwide. METHODS: Our study investigated the antibiotic resistance features and molecular epidemiology of 52 clinical isolates of A. baumannii collected in Pakistan between 2013 and 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined by the agar disc diffusion method. Comparative sequence analyses of the ampC and bla(OXA-51-like) alleles were used to assign the isolates into clusters. The whole genomes of 25 representative isolates were sequenced using the MiSeq Desktop Sequencer. Free online applications were used to determine the phylogeny of genomic sequences, retrieve the multilocus sequence types (ST), and detect acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. RESULTS: Overall, the isolates were grouped into 7 clusters and 3 sporadic isolates. The largest cluster, Ab-Pak-cluster-1 (bla(OXA-66) and ISAba1-ampC-19) included 24 isolates, belonged to ST2 and International clone (IC) II, and was distributed between two geographical far-off cities, Lahore and Peshawar. Ab-Pak-clusters-2 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2), and -3 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-20) and the individual isolate Ab-Pak-Lah-01 (ISAba1-bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2) were also assigned to ST2 and IC II. On the other hand, Ab-Pak-clusters-4 (bla(OXA-69), ampC-1), -5 (bla(OXA-69), ISAba1-ampC-78), and -6A (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-3) belonged to ST1, while Ab-Pak-cluster-6B (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-8) belonged to ST1106, with both ST1 and ST1106 being members of IC I. Five isolates belonged to Ab-Pak-cluster-7 (bla(OXA-65), ampC-43). This cluster corresponded to ST158, showed a well-delineated position on the genomic phylogenetic tree, and was equipped with several antimicrobial resistance genes including bla(OXA-23) and bla(GES-11). CONCLUSIONS: Our study detected the occurrence of 7 clusters of A. baumannii in Pakistan. Altogether, 6/7 of the clusters and 45/52 (86.5%) of the isolates belonged to IC I (n = 9) or II (n = 36), making Pakistan no exception to the global domination of these two clones. The onset of ST158 in Pakistan marked a geographical dispersal of this clone beyond the Middle East and brought up the need for a detailed characterization.","publish_time":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karah, Nabil; Khalid, Fizza; Wai, Sun Nyunt; Uhlin, Bernt Eric; Ahmad, Irfan","journal":"Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e823eb8c52d015cc2e12b0f7765311676633df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6964048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6964048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Acinetobacter"],"organizations":["IC II","IC I.

We investigated sufficient conditions for in-circuit elevation in pressure using an ex vivo re-circulation circuit with porcine blood. Specifically, we investigated the effect of blood conditions, the type of anticoagulation, and pro-inflammatory stimulation on in-circuit pressure. We also examined the cause of an abnormal elevation of in-circuit pressure by specifically degrading DNA, RNA, or protein components of an obstructed filter and by using immunofluorescent techniques. Neither a change in temperature nor change in pH in the blood increased in-circuit pressure. In contrast, long-term storage of blood, pro-inflammatory stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate, and heparin administration significantly increased in-circuit pressure. Abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure was associated with deposition of extracellular DNA on the outlet surface of the filter. Administration of DNase resulted in a rapid decline of in-circuit pressure. In an ex vivo re-circulation circuit system, extracellular DNA deposition on the filter is responsible for an abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure. Senescent leukocytes, stimulated leukocytes, and heparin exposure are associated with extracellular DNA deposition.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yashima, Nozomi; Ito, Takashi; Kajiyama, Kenji; Maeda, Hiroyuki; Kakihana, Yasuyuki; Maruyama, Ikuro","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cf9c120c360c2cfbafe7c855779e5270fa51509.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6965310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["circuit pressure","circuit elevation","abnormal elevation","extracorporeal circulation circuit","re-circulation circuit system","deposition of extracellular DNA","extracellular DNA deposition","porcine blood","effect of blood conditions","pro-inflammatory stimulation","long-term storage of blood","heparin administration","obstructed filter","change","heparin exposure","serious complication","stimulated leukocytes","Senescent leukocytes","Administration of DNase","sufficient conditions","phorbol myristate acetate","type of anticoagulation","protein components","outlet surface","rapid decline","precise mechanism","RNA","immunofluorescent techniques","contrast","temperature","cause","Clot formation"],"language":"en"},

It is important to implement effective cleaning for the safe hospital environment. We conducted a three-phase study using human factors engineering (HFE) approach to enhance environmental cleanliness. METHODS: This study was conducted using a prospective interventional trial, and 28 (33.3%) of 84 wards in a medical center were sampled. The three-phases included pre-intervention analysis (Phase 1), implementing interventions by HFE principles (Phase 2), and programmatic analysis (Phase 3). The evaluations of terminal cleaning and disinfection were performed using the fluorescent marker, the adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay, and the aerobic colony count method simultaneously in all phases. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection was qualified with the aggregate outcome of the same 10 high-touch surfaces per room. A score for each high-touch surface was recorded, with 0 denoting a fail and 10 denoting a pass by the benchmark of the evaluation method, and the total terminal cleaning and disinfection score (TCD score) was a score out of 100. RESULTS: In each phase, 840 high-touch surfaces were collected from 84 rooms after terminal cleaning and disinfection. After the interventions, the TCD score by the three evaluation methods all showed significant improved. The carriage incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) decreased significantly from 4.1 per 1000 patient-days to 3.6 per 1000 patient-days (P = .03). CONCLUSION: The HFE approach can improve the thoroughness and the effectiveness of terminal cleaning and disinfection, and resulted in a reduction of patient carriage of MDRO at hospitals. Larger studies are necessary to establish whether such efforts of cleanliness can reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infection.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, I-Chen; Chang, Hao-Yuan; Cheng, Aristine; Chen, Mei-Wen; Chen, An-Chi; Ting, Ling; Lai, Yeur-Hur; Wang, Jann-Tay; Chen, Yee-Chun; Sheng, Wang-Huei","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b1e09cef6d76111b87a35a718c28cf86267d2c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6966902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFE","TCD","MDRO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disinfection score","Effective terminal cleaning","effective cleaning","total terminal cleaning","effectiveness of terminal cleaning","evaluations of terminal cleaning","TCD score","phase study","Inadequate hospital cleaning","high-touch surfaces","HFE approach","patient-days","evaluation methods","HFE principles","phases","reduction of patient carriage of MDRO","interventions","carriage incidence of multidrug","incidence of healthcare","programmatic analysis","efforts of cleanliness","environmental cleanliness","safe hospital environment","pre-intervention analysis","aerobic colony count method","adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay","fluorescent marker","resistant organism","human factors","thoroughness","rooms","cross-transmission","pass","associated infection","benchmark","BACKGROUND","hospitals","aggregate outcome","prospective interventional trial","wards","medical center","Larger studies","pathogens","CONCLUSION","fail","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

AF substrate was tested two- and four-weeks post implantation and was also compared with implanted rats early post-implantation (Base). Aldo and MI increased the AF substrate and atrial fibrosis. In the MI group only, AF duration was correlated with the level of atrial fibrosis and was inversely correlated with systolic function. Unexpectedly, Shams also developed progressive AF substrate relative to Base individuals. Further studies indicated that serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were not elevated in the shams. In addition, we excluded anxiety\\depression due to social-isolation as an AF promoting factor.

This study aimed to evaluate whether pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We prospectively included 92 patients intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. We used a technique based on a nitrogen multiple breath washout method to measure FRC before the planned extubation. The median FRC before extubation was 25 mL/kg (Interquartile range, 20\u201332 mL/Kg) per predicted body weight (pBW). After extubation, 20 patients (21.7%) were reintubated within 48 hours. The median FRC was higher in the extubation success group than in the extubation failure group (27 versus 21 mL/Kg, p \u003C 0.001). Reduced FRC was associated with higher risk of extubation failure (odds ratio, 1.14 per each decreased of 1 mL/Kg of FRC/pBW, 95% CI, 1.05\u20131.23, p = 0.002).

TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) are ubiquitous outer membrane \u03B2-barrel proteins; they play an important role in the recognition of siderophores during iron uptake. Here, in the APEC strain DE205B, we investigated the role of four putative TBDRs\u2014ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235\u2014in iron uptake. Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays indicated that the proteins encoded by these genes directly interact with TonB. Moreover, the expression levels of all four genes were significantly upregulated under iron-depleted conditions compared with iron-rich conditions. The expression levels of several iron uptake-related genes were significantly increased in the ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 deletion strains, with the upregulation being the most prominent in the ireA deletion mutant. Furthermore, iron uptake by the ireA deletion strain was significantly increased compared to that by the wild-type strain. Moreover, a tonB mutant strain was constructed to study the effect of tonB deletion on the TBDRs. We found that regardless of the presence of tonB, the expression levels of the genes encoding the four TBDRs were regulated by fur. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 indeed encode TBDRs, with ireA having the most important role in iron uptake. These results should help future studies explore the mechanisms underlying the TonB-dependent iron uptake pathway.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zhonghua; Jiang, Shan; Liu, Yun; Sun, Yu; Yu, Peixin; Gong, Qianwen; Zeng, Hang; Li, Yihao; Xue, Feng; Zhuge, Xiangkai; Ren, Jianluan; Dai, Jianjun; Tang, Fang","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da174e0caf661809615fc0ee7b78a22829ea9380.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6979363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli","E. coli"],"organizations":["APEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iron uptake-related genes","ireA deletion strain","TonB-dependent iron uptake pathway","tonB mutant strain","ireA deletion mutant","iron-rich conditions","iron-depleted conditions","effect of tonB deletion","presence of tonB","TonB-dependent receptors","putative TBDRs","expression levels","important role","deletion strains","common virulence genes","APEC strain DE205B","wild-type strain","Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli","pathotype of extraintestinal pathogenic","ubiquitous outer membrane \u03B2-barrel proteins","neonatal meningitis-associated","transferase pulldown assays","mechanisms","recognition of siderophores","Glutathione-S","serious infectious diseases of poultry","future studies","upregulation","results","conclusion","findings","fur"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: All patients admitted in the intensive care unit in a 629-bed tertiary referral hospital in Japan from August 2016 to February 2019 were enrolled. During the study period, PX-UV disinfection was added to manual terminal cleaning after every patient transfer/discharge. For microbiological evaluation, surfaces were selected for sampling by contact plates before/after manual cleaning and after PX-UV. After overnight incubation, colonies on the plates were counted. RESULTS: The incidence of newly acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) declined significantly (13.8 to 9.9 per 10,000 patient days, incidence rate ratio 0.71, p = 0.002), as well as that of newly acquired drug-resistant Acinetobacter (48.5 to 18.1, 0.37, p \u003C 0.001).

Content: Visual logistics help integrate and synthesize POCT and geospatial concepts. The resulting geospatial solutions presented here comprise: (1) small-world networks and regional topography; (2) space-time transformation, hubs, and asset mapping; (3) spatial and geospatial care paths\u2122; (4) GIS-POCT; (5) isolation laboratories, diagnostics isolators, and mobile laboratories for highly infectious diseases; (6) alternate care facilities; (7) roaming POCT\u2014airborne, ambulances, space, and wearables; (8) connected and wireless POCT outside hospitals; (9) unmanned aerial vehicles; (10) geospatial practice\u2014demographic care unit resource scoring, geographic risk assessment, and national POCT policy and guidelines; (11) the hybrid laboratory; and (12) point-of-careology. Value: Small-world networks and their connectivity facilitate efficient and effective placement of POCT for optimal response, rescue, diagnosis, and treatment. Spatial care paths\u2122 speed transport from primary encounters to referral centers bypassing topographic bottlenecks, process gaps, and time-consuming interruptions. Regional GISs position POCT close to where patients live to facilitate rapid triage, decrease therapeutic turnaround time, and conserve economic resources. Geospatial care paths\u2122 encompass demographic and population access features. Timeliness creates value during acute illness, complex crises, and unexpected disasters. Isolation laboratories equipped with POCT help stop outbreaks and safely support critically ill patients with highly infectious diseases. POCT-enabled spatial grids can map sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of epidemics for ring vaccination. Impact: Geospatial solutions generate inherently optimal and logical placement of POCT conceptually, physically, and temporally as a means to improve crisis response and spatial resilience. If public health professionals, geospatial scientists, and POCT specialists join forces, new collaborative teamwork can create faster response and higher impact during disasters, complex crises, outbreaks, and epidemics, as well as more efficient primary, urgent, and emergency community care.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kost, Gerald J.","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/731a1455688921b0d728c1ca833b7fa918c1e435.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6988819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["POCT help","POCT specialists","wireless POCT","GIS-POCT","geospatial care paths","geospatial practice","geospatial concepts","effective placement of POCT","logical placement of POCT","national POCT policy","geospatial scientists","geospatial tools","care testing","emergency community care","resulting geospatial solutions","Regional GISs position POCT close","crisis standards of care","alternate care facilities","spatial resilience","demographic care unit resource scoring","optimal response","healthcare small-world networks","crisis response","spatial grids","isolation laboratories","faster response","public health practice","complex crises","geographic limits of epidemics","emergency management","mobile laboratories","outbreaks","Value","infectious diseases","community resilience","geographic risk assessment","geographic information systems","public health professionals","primary encounters","higher impact","regional topography","unexpected disasters","ill patients","limited-resource countries","Visual logistics help","referral centers","speed transport","topographic bottlenecks","new collaborative teamwork","tandem","process gaps","disaster preparedness","forces","points of need","connectivity","therapeutic turnaround time","acute illness","sentinel cases","space-time transformation","rapid triage","diagnostics isolators","rescue","asset mapping","hubs","diagnosis","ring vaccination","ambulances","guidelines","population access features","economic resources","time-consuming interruptions","global settings","Content","Timeliness","hospitals","aerial vehicles","means","wearables","treatment","hybrid laboratory","careology","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we demonstrate that exposure of astrocytes to HIV-1 protein Tat mediates the induction and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) microRNA-7 (miR-7) that is taken up by neurons, leading in turn, to downregulation of neuronal neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) and ultimately to synaptic alterations. More importantly, we report that these impairments could be reversed by pretreatment of neurons with a neurotrophic factor platelet-derived growth factor-CC (PDGF-CC).

Most septoplasties aim to improve diurnal and nocturnal nasal obstruction. The evidence base for septoplasty clinical effectiveness is hitherto very limited. AIMS: To establish, and inform guidance for, the best management strategy for individuals with nasal obstruction associated with a deviated septum. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicentre, mixed-methods, open label, randomised controlled trial of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and a reduced nasal airway. Eligible patients will have septal deflection visible at nasendoscopy and a nasal symptom score \u2265 30 on the NOSE questionnaire. Surgical treatment comprises septoplasty with or without reduction of the inferior nasal turbinate on the anatomically wider side of the nose. Medical management comprises a nasal saline spray followed by a fluorinated steroid spray daily for six months. The recruitment target is 378 patients, recruited from up to 17 sites across Scotland, England and Wales. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by gender and severity (NOSE score). Participants will be followed up for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the total SNOT-22 score at 6 months. Clinical and economic outcomes will be modelled against baseline severity (NOSE scale) to inform clinical decision-making. The study includes a recruitment enhancement process, and an economic evaluation. DISCUSSION: The NAIROS trial will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and symptoms of nasal blockage. Identifying those individuals most likely to benefit from surgery should enable more efficient and effective clinical decision-making, and avoid unnecessary operations where there is low likelihood of patient benefit.

However, brain RAS is an independent form of RAS expressed locally in the brain, which is known to be involved in brain functions and disorders. There is strong evidence for a major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT-1R) axis in increased activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated strong neuroprotective effects by blocking AT1R in these brain disorders. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (1\u20137)/Mas receptor (MASR), is another axis of brain RAS which counteracts the damaging effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on neurons in the brain. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and activation of ACE2/Angiotensin (1\u20137)/MASR axis may serve as an exciting and novel method for neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here in this review article, we discuss the expression of RAS in the brain and highlight how altered RAS level may cause neurodegeneration. Understanding the pathophysiology of RAS and their links to neurodegeneration has enormous potential to identify potentially effective pharmacological tools to treat neurodegenerative diseases in the brain.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abiodun, Oyesiji A.; Ola, Mohammad Shamsul","journal":"Saudi J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e90670ce5061438424bedfc1f400b75e3dea417.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7042626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7042626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ACE/Ang II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["axis of brain RAS","brain disorders","brain functions","Angiotensin type","major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin","expression of RAS","pathophysiology of RAS","Renin angiotensin system","AT1R axis","neurodegeneration","altered RAS level","independent form of RAS","MASR axis","enzyme","neurodegenerative diseases","activation of ACE2","receptor blockers","Mas receptor","damaging effects of ACE","strong neuroprotective effects","strong evidence","endocrine system","increased activation of oxidative stress","body fluid volume regulation","cardiovascular control","electrolyte homeostasis","physiological roles","apoptosis","neuroinflammation","effective pharmacological tools","enormous potential","neuroprotection","links","ARBs","peripheral circulation","novel method","Numerous studies","neurons","review article"],"language":"en"},

The emergence of virulent, antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus is a significant public health concern. Most virulence and resistance factors in S. aureus are encoded by mobile genetic elements, and transduction by bacteriophages represents the main mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. The baseplate is a specialized structure at the tip of bacteriophage tails that plays key roles in host recognition, cell wall penetration, and DNA ejection. We have used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the S. aureus bacteriophage 80\u03B1 baseplate at 3.75 \u00C5 resolution, allowing atomic models to be built for most of the major tail and baseplate proteins, including two tail fibers, the receptor binding protein, and part of the tape measure protein. Our structure provides a structural basis for understanding host recognition, cell wall penetration and DNA ejection in viruses infecting Gram-positive bacteria. Comparison to other phages demonstrates the modular design of baseplate proteins, and the adaptations to the host that take place during the evolution of staphylococci and other pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kizziah, James L.; Manning, Keith A.; Dearborn, Altaira D.; Dokland, Terje","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e7042ac51bcdbd64db05d998292e8ed45ebfc07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7048315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7048315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aureus bacteriophage","host recognition","Staphylococcus aureus","\u03B1 baseplate","cell wall penetration","DNA ejection","modular design of baseplate proteins","specialized structure","tail fibers","major tail","tip of bacteriophage tails","receptor binding protein","tape measure protein","key roles","main mechanism","transduction","bacteriophages","viruses","\u00C5 resolution","antibiotic-resistant strains","common cause of infections","mobile genetic elements","horizontal gene transfer","structural basis","significant public health concern","place","Gram-positive bacteria","adaptations","emergence of virulent","evolution of staphylococci","high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy","atomic models","humans","virulence","resistance factors","pathogens","Comparison"],"language":"en"},

A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources \u2013 Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive \u2013 to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geolocalized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tizzoni, Michele; Panisson, Andr\u00E9; Paolotti, Daniela; Cattuto, Ciro","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f2322b1d2721ccf380837b06301b507397b633c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c5bf5beb177c16aa29255e89e0cf47e4e9467cce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/346411","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GDELT Project"],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["epidemic outbreaks","Zika virus epidemic","public awareness","disease dynamics","patterns of Zika","epidemiological data","scarcity of data","empirical data","related Wikipedia pageviews","Geolocalized Wikipedia pageview data reveal","media exposure","terms of Zika","disease transmission dynamics","geo-referenced data","interaction","news coverage","triggered media coverage","media pressure","studies","attention","population-scale information","human behaviour change","public health agencies","important role of collective awareness","news volume","related pages","general modelling framework","number of modelling efforts","international alert","online sources","relation","nonlinear dependencies","memory effects","GDELT Project","theoretical models","Internet Archive","activity profile","assumption","beginning","United States","national television broadcast","behavioural signal","recent years","magnitude","extent"],"language":"en"},

NK cells develop from a common lymphoid precursor resident in the bone marrow (BM) that is considered the main site of their generation. The BM microenvironment provides a rich source of cytokines and growth factors and allows intimate contact between developing NK cells and stromal cells, which is required for their full maturation. Individual NK cell subsets displaying unique functional features, and tissue locations have been identified both in mouse and humans. Involvement of chemokines in the regulation of DC-mediated NK cell priming and effector functions has also been documented and should be taken into account when analyzing the role of chemokines in NK cell-dependent immune responses. Studies in man and mouse have shown that NK cells are distributed in several organs under normal conditions. Their frequency is comparatively high in nonlymphoid organs such as the lung, the liver and the mucosal tissue of maternal uterus, and rare in thymus and lymph nodes. Chemotactic factors, including chemokines, play critical roles in the regulation of NK cell migration across endothelium and into the tissues. The differences in chemokine receptor expression together with distinct adhesive properties of different NK cell subsets as well as activated NK cells, imply that they have multiple routes of circulation and trafficking patterns. Besides their role in the regulation of NK cell trafficking, chemotactic molecules can also affect NK cell effector functions by regulating their priming and their ability to kill and secrete cytokines.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gismondi, Angela; Bernardini, Giovanni; Santoni, Angela","journal":"Natural Killer Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f6052a0d41ac2f8a5bb92444cf020a7f260ba49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150052.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704542000156; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704542000156","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Publisher Summary Natural","NK","BM","Individual NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediated NK cell","developing NK cells","activated NK cells","regulation of NK cell trafficking","NK cell effector functions","regulation of NK cell migration","Individual NK cell subsets","NK cell-dependent immune responses","distinct adhesive properties of different NK cell subsets","stromal cells","role of chemokines","Involvement of chemokines","regulation of DC","cytotoxic functions","Chemotactic factors","important role","number of cytokines","mouse","rich source of cytokines","early phase of immune responses","growth factors","chemotactic molecules","tissue locations","trafficking patterns","nonlymphoid organs","BM microenvironment","distinct lineage of lymphocytes","mucosal tissue of maternal uterus","unique functional features","certain microbial pathogens","intimate contact","common lymphoid precursor resident","chemokine receptor expression","bone marrow","thymus","endothelium","critical roles","Publisher Summary Natural killer","multiple routes of circulation","lung","liver","lymph nodes","differences","frequency","main site","generation","tissues","normal conditions","Studies","ability","account","humans","maturation"],"language":"en"},

This article reviews aspects of emergency care for most commonly kept fowl, including triage, patient assessment, diagnostic procedures, supportive care, short-term hospitalization, and common emergency presentations.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sabater Gonz\u00E1lez, Mikel; Calvo Carrasco, Daniel","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d0ab262b94dae53c23e9434b5484618b7fce7eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110600.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094919416000086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26948266/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094919416000086; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvex.2016.01.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["game fowl","kept fowl","land fowl","Multiple fowl species","supportive care","article reviews aspects of emergency care","common emergency presentations","diagnostic procedures","short-term hospitalization","patient assessment","legislation","triage","Galliformes","groups","clinicians","reportable diseases","molecular similarities","antibiotic use","long history of domestication","countries","animals","biological orders","close evolutionary relatives"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we adopted a mammalian two-hybrid system to screen the genome-wide intraviral protein-protein interactions of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and therefrom revealed a number of novel interactions which could be partly confirmed by in vitro biochemical assays. Three pairs of the interactions identified were detected in both directions: non-structural protein (nsp) 10 and nsp14, nsp10 and nsp16, and nsp7 and nsp8. The interactions between the multifunctional nsp10 and nsp14 or nsp16, which are the unique proteins found in the members of Nidovirales with large RNA genomes including coronaviruses and toroviruses, may have important implication for the mechanisms of replication/transcription complex assembly and functions of these viruses. Using a SARS-CoV replicon expressing a luciferase reporter under the control of a transcription regulating sequence, it has been shown that several viral proteins (N, X and SUD domains of nsp3, and nsp12) provided in trans stimulated the replicon reporter activity, indicating that these proteins may regulate coronavirus replication and transcription.

The study aimed to screen the most useful predictive factor for critical illness caused by COVID-19. METHODS The study prospectively involved 61 patients with COVID-19 infection as a derivation cohort, and 54 patients as a validation cohort. The predictive factor for critical illness was selected using LASSO regression analysis. A nomogram based on non-specific laboratory indicators was built to predict the probability of critical illness. RESULTS The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection. The NLR had an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.707 to 0.991) in the derivation cohort and 0.867 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.944) in the validation cohort, the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision and clinical impact curves showed that the NLR had high standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of critical illness was 9.1% (1/11) for patients aged \u2265 50 and having an NLR \u003C 3.13, and 50% (7/14) patients with age \u2265 50 and NLR \u2265 3.13 were predicted to develop critical illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR according to age, this study has developed a COVID-19 pneumonia management process. CONCLUSIONS We found that NLR is a predictive factor for early-stage prediction of patients infected with COVID-19 who are likely to develop critical illness. Patients aged \u2265 50 and having an NLR \u2265 3.13 are predicted to develop critical illness, and they should thus have rapid access to an intensive care unit if necessary.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jingyuan; Liu, Yao; Xiang, Pan; Pu, Lin; Xiong, Haofeng; Li, Chuansheng; Zhang, Ming; Tan, Jianbo; Xu, Yanli; Song, Rui; Song, Meihua; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Wei; Han, Bing; Yang, Li; Wang, Xiaojing; Zhou, Guiqin; Zhang, Ting; Li, Ben; Wang, Yanbin; Chen, Zhihai; Wang, Xianbo","journal":"Journal of translational medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434518/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02374-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probability of critical illness","incidence of critical illness","COVID","BACKGROUND Patients","risk stratification of NLR","stage prediction of patients","infection","validation cohort","derivation cohort","study","useful predictive factor","independent risk factor","rapid disease progression","rapid access","calibration curves","coronavirus disease","clinical impact curves","intensive care unit","acute respiratory failure","high standardized net benefit","decision","LASSO regression analysis","non-specific laboratory indicators","nomogram","characteristic","pneumonia management process","lymphocyte ratio","area","receiver","addition","confidence interval","neutrophil","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The assay is based upon detection of intracellular TNF\u03B1 using the cross-reactive mAb 6401.1111, raised against the human cytokine. Allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb 6401.1111 specifically stained feline TNF\u03B1-producing murine cells and also Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B-stimulated feline T cells, thus providing formal evidence for cross-reactivity. By using the anti-TNF\u03B1 mAb in combination with PE- and FITC-conjugated mAbs against feline CD4 and CD8, respectively, antiviral CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells could be identified in the peripheral blood and in the spleens of feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cats. Moreover, feline calicivirus (FCV)-specific CD4\u002B T cells were detected in the spleens of FCV-vaccinated cats. As antigen-presenting cells (APCs), we used immortalized autologous fibroblast cell lines, PBMC or splenocytes. A straightforward protocol, in which splenocyte preparations served both as APCs and effector cells, consistently yielded best results. The assay will permit further studies of the cellular immune responses in cats during natural and experimental viral infections.

Holstein heifers (n = 1,811) derived from artificial insemination were categorized as (1) daughters of primiparous cows that, consequently, were nonlactating heifers during gestation (Prim-NoL; n = 787); (2) daughters of multiparous cows that did not have any clinical diseases in the previous lactation (Mult-NoCD; n = 638); and (3) daughters of multiparous cows that had at least one clinical disease in the previous lactation (Mult-CD; n = 386). Clinical diseases of the multiparous dams included retained placenta, metritis, mastitis, lameness, and digestive and respiratory problems. Data collected for evaluation of daughters included genotypic and phenotypic characteristics at birth, morbidity, reproductive performance, and culling from birth through 305 d in milk of first lactation. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate the effect of the parity of the dam (Prim-NoL vs. Mult-NoCD \u002B Mult-CD) and the effect of clinical disease occurrence in the previous lactation among multiparous dams (Mult-NoCD vs. Mult-CD). Compared with daughters of multiparous cows, daughters of Prim-NoL were lighter at birth (36 vs. 41 kg), had greater genetic merit for production traits (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk yield: 875 vs. 746 kg), were less likely to leave the herd (17 vs. 28%) and to lose pregnancy as a heifer (9 vs. 14%), calved earlier (703 vs. 711 d old), were less likely to have clinical diseases as a first lactation cow (30 vs. 37%), and had reduced performance in the first lactation when considering their genetic merit (e.g., 305-d yield of energy-corrected milk: 11,270 vs. 11,539 kg). Compared with daughters of Mult-NoCD, daughters of Mult-CD were less likely to have digestive problems as a heifer (17 vs. 27%) and clinical disease as a first lactation cow (32 vs. 42%), but were also more likely to leave the herd as a heifer (32 vs. 25%) even though genetic merit for production traits were similar (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk: 744 vs. 749 kg). In conclusion, both parity and health status of the dam in the previous lactation were associated with morbidity, survival, and performance of their daughters from birth through 305 d in milk of the first lactation and might represent factors affecting developmental programming of dairy heifers in utero.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carvalho, M.

We compared cases with and without bacterial co-infection. RESULTS: The incidence of influenza A H1N1 infection in CAP during the pandemic period was 19% (n, 667). We studied 128 patients; 42(33%) had bacterial co-infection. The most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (26, 62%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 14%). Predictors for bacterial co-infection were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increase of platelets count. The hospital mortality was 9%. Factors associated with mortality were age \u226565 years, presence of septic shock and the need for mechanical ventilation.

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein is a major virulence factor for several coronavirus species, including the OC43 strain of HCoV (HCoV-OC43). In an attempt to study the role of this protein in virus spread within the central nervous system (CNS) and neurovirulence, as well as to identify amino acid residues important for such functions, we compared the sequence of the S gene found in the laboratory reference strain HCoV-OC43 ATCC VR-759 to S sequences of viruses detected in clinical isolates from the human respiratory tract. We identified one predominant mutation at amino acid 758 (from RRSR\u2193 G (758) to RRSR\u2193R (758)), which introduces a putative furin-like cleavage (\u2193) site. Using a molecular cDNA infectious clone to generate a corresponding recombinant virus, we show for the first time that such point mutation in the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein creates a functional cleavage site between the S1 and S2 portions of the S protein. While the corresponding recombinant virus retained its neuroinvasive properties, this mutation led to decreased neurovirulence while potentially modifying the mode of virus spread, likely leading to a limited dissemination within the CNS. Taken together, these results are consistent with the adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to the CNS environment, resulting from the selection of quasi-species harboring mutations that lead to amino acid changes in viral genes, like the S gene in HCoV-OC43, which may contribute to a more efficient establishment of a less pathogenic but persistent CNS infection. This adaptative mechanism could potentially be associated with human encephalitis or other neurological degenerative pathologies.","publish_time":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le Coupanec, Alain; Desforges, Marc; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Dub\u00E9, Mathieu; Day, Robert; Seidah, Nabil G.; Talbot, Pierre J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dacc557b6e40bb69974e2e1a831aef665e524867.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4636366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein","OC43 strain of HCoV","S gene","S protein","adaptation of HCoV","laboratory reference strain HCoV-OC43 ATCC VR","S sequences of viruses","corresponding recombinant virus","CNS environment","mode of virus","amino acid changes","amino acid residues important","neuroinvasive properties","human encephalitis","human respiratory tract","Human coronaviruses","point mutation","predominant mutation","persistent CNS infection","RRSR","functional cleavage site","coronavirus species","viral genes","neurotropic properties","viral spike","respiratory pathogens","decreased neurovirulence","selection of quasi-species","neurological degenerative pathologies","development of neurological diseases","clinical isolates","view","mutations","S1","major virulence factor","S2 portions","functions","central nervous system","molecular cDNA infectious clone","role","efficient establishment","results","putative furin","time","limited dissemination","adaptative mechanism","attempt"],"language":"en"},

The binding strength of each of the X(j) reagents to each other is measured, for example by an ELISA assay, giving an N\u00D7N matrix K . The matrix K is used to define another set of N reagents called Y(j), with j=1 to N, each of which is a linear combination of the X(j) reagents and each of which is tailored to be complementary to one of the X(j) reagents. Each of the N pairs of reagents X(j) and Y(j) defines an axis in an N-dimensional shape space. The definition of these axes facilitates proteomic analysis of diverse biological samples, for example, mixtures of proteins such as serum samples or T cell extracts. A method for defining and measuring similarity between pairs of biological samples and between sets of biological samples in the context of the set of N reagent pairs is described. This leads to methods for using the N reagent pairs in the diagnosis of diseases and in the formulation of preventive and therapeutic vaccines.

However, the variability of inactivation across farms and over time is unknown because most studies have examined pathogen inactivation under ideal laboratory conditions or have focused on only one or two full\u2010scale digesters at a time. In contrast, we sampled seven full\u2010scale digesters treating cattle manure in Wisconsin for 9 mo on a biweekly basis (n = 118 pairs of influent and effluent samples) and used real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze these samples for 19 different microbial genetic markers. Overall, inactivation of pathogens and fecal indicators was highly variable. When aggregated across digester and season, log\u2010removal values for several representative microorganisms\u2014bovine Bacteroides, Bacteroidales\u2010like CowM3, and bovine polyomavirus\u2014were 0.78 \u00B1 0.34, 0.70 \u00B1 0.50, and 0.53 \u00B1 0.58, respectively (mean \u00B1 SD). These log\u2010removal values were up to two times lower than expected based on the scientific literature. Thus, our study indicates that full\u2010scale anaerobic digestion of cattle manure requires optimization with regard to pathogen inactivation. Future studies should focus on identifying the potential causes of this suboptimal performance (e.g., overloading, poor mixing, poor temperature control). Our study also examined the fate of pathogens during manure separation and found that the majority of microbes we detected ended up in the liquid fraction of separated manure. This finding has important implications for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens through the environment to humans. CORE IDEAS: Pathogen inactivation is highly variable among full\u2010scale anaerobic digesters. Pathogen inactivation by full\u2010scale digesters on cattle farms needs optimization.

They show a worldwide distribution, a high degree of ecological diversification as well as a high diversity of associated parasites and pathogens. Despite their prominent and unique role, the knowledge of their parasite-host-relationships as well as the mechanisms of co-evolutionary processes are, partly due to strict conservation regulations, scarce. METHODS: Juvenile specimens of the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) from a roosting colony in Gladenbach (Hesse, Germany) were examined for their metazoan endo-and ectoparasite infections and pathogens. Morphometric data were recorded and the individuals were checked for Lyssavirus-specific antigen using a direct immunofluorescence test. For unambiguous species identification, the bats were analysed by cyt-b sequence comparison. RESULTS: Myotis myotis were parasitized by the six insect and arachnid ectoparasite species, i.e. Ixodes ricinus, Ischnopsyllus octactenus, Ichoronyssus scutatus, Steatonyssus periblepharus, Spinturnix myoti and Cimex dissimilis. Additionally, the nematode Molinostrongylus alatus and the cestode Vampirolepis balsaci were recorded. Each bat was parasitized by at least four species. The parasites showed partially extreme rates of infection, never recorded before, with more than 1,440 parasites per single host. Ichoronyssus scutatus, Steatonyssus periblepharus, Vampirolepis balsaci and Molinostrongylus alatus are recorded for the first time in Germany. A checklist for Europe is presented containing records of 98 parasite species of 14 Myotis species. CONCLUSIONS: The Myotis myotis from Gladenbach (Hesse, Germany) were parasitized by a diverse parasite fauna with high infestation rates. We assume that in juvenile Myotis the number of parasites is generally higher than in adults due to only later acquired immune competence and behavioural adaptations. Our results revealed new insights into parasite fauna of M. myotis and European bats in general. The finding of endoparasitic cyclophyllidean cestodes that have a two-host lifecycle is, considering the stationary behaviour of the juvenile bats, rather unusual and suggests a non-predatory transmission mechanism (e.g. via autoinfection). A new insight gained from the collated literature was that the European wide composition of the Myotis parasite fauna is dominated by a few specific taxonomic groups in Europe.","publish_time":"2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frank, Raphael; Kuhn, Thomas; Werblow, Antje; Liston, Andrew; Kochmann, Judith; Klimpel, Sven","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab4ac6a35dc75015f99a5c253c05dbda5628639a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4336729.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0707-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gladenbach"],"locations":["Mammalia","Germany","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Myotis myotis","Myotis species","juvenile Myotis","Myotis parasite fauna","parasite-host","juvenile bats","diverse parasite fauna","European bats","arachnid ectoparasite species","Germany","species-rich orders","unambiguous species identification","number of parasites","high diversity of associated parasites","Steatonyssus periblepharus","Ichoronyssus scutatus","high infestation rates","Gladenbach","Juvenile specimens","Hesse","pathogens","RESULTS","host lifecycle","single host","cestode Vampirolepis balsaci","nematode Molinostrongylus alatus","high degree of ecological diversification","ectoparasite infections","new insights","European wide composition","Lyssavirus-specific antigen","specific taxonomic groups","extreme rates of infection","greater mouse-eared bat","Ixodes ricinus","Ischnopsyllus octactenus","Spinturnix myoti","collated literature","roosting colony","knowledge","non-predatory transmission mechanism","Cimex dissimilis","stationary behaviour","direct immunofluorescence test","individuals","metazoan endo","records","insect","immune competence","mechanisms of co-evolutionary processes","cyt-b sequence comparison","unique role","worldwide distribution","strict conservation regulations","finding of endoparasitic cyclophyllidean cestodes","behavioural adaptations","autoinfection","METHODS","adults","Mammalia","relationships","CONCLUSIONS","Morphometric data","checklist","time","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease. To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese\u2013Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline. Methods The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world. Results We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients\u2019 disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases. Conclusion To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines. Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Leonard T.F.; Chan, Karina K.H.; Chung, Vincent C.H.; Leung, Ting Hung","journal":"Eur J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fc9f7167f8950a389c6b8eeab1117cbb6ff87d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129866.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382020303899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292529/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382020303899?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","TCM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["National COVID","confirmed COVID","relevant TCM treatments of COVID","suspected COVID","waves of COVID","clinical classifications of COVID","TCM recommendations","TCM practitioners","internationalisation of TCM","Chinese guideline","national guideline","TCM pattern diagnoses","China","Treatment Guideline","Traditional Chinese medicine","number of confirmed cases","sake of public health","World Health Organization","best management","implementation of integrative Chinese","recent case definition","up-to-date information","coronavirus disease","rehabilitation of recovering cases","herbal formulae","local public health measures","types of Chinese patent medicines","patients\u2019 disease status","Western Medicine","practical information","recent editions","initial outbreak","Medical professionals","up-to-date guidelines","frontline experience of medical experts","opinions","Diagnostic","adherence","citizens","researchers","groups","evidence base","accordance","country","Abstract Introduction","outcomes","epicentre","Methods","countries","Future evaluation","Conclusion","fold","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which is structurally categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, within the same group as influenza virus and HIV. However, S proteins have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of proteases. The exact location of the CoV fusion peptide (FP) has been disputed. However, most evidence suggests that the domain immediately downstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site is the FP (amino acids 798\u2013818 SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQY for SARS-CoV, FP1). In our previous electron spin resonance spectroscopic studies, the membrane-ordering effect of influenza virus, HIV, and Dengue virus FPs has been consistently observed. In this study, we used this effect as a criterion to identify and characterize the bona fide SARS-CoV FP. Our results indicate that both FP1 and the region immediately downstream (amino acids 816\u2013835 KQYGECLGDINARDLICAQKF, FP2) induce significant membrane ordering. Furthermore, their effects are calcium dependent, which is consistent with in vivo data showing that calcium is required for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed a direct interaction between calcium cations and both FPs. This Ca2\u002B-dependency membrane ordering was not observed with influenza FP, indicating that the CoV FP exhibits a mechanistically different behavior.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and patient acceptability of self-collected foam nasal swabs for detection of respiratory viruses in SOT recipients and to define the virologic and clinical course. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively monitored the course of symptomatic respiratory virus infection in 18 SOT patients (14 lung, 3 liver, and 1 kidney) using patient self-collected swabs. RESULTS: The initial study sample was positive in 15 patients with the following respiratory viruses: rhinovirus (6), metapneumovirus (1), coronavirus (2), respiratory syncytial virus (2), parainfluenza virus (2), and influenza A virus (2). One hundred four weekly self-collected nasal swabs were obtained, with a median of 4 samples per patient (range 1\u201317). Median duration of viral detection was 21 days (range 4\u201377 days). Additional new respiratory viruses detected during follow-up of these 15 patients included rhinovirus (3), metapneumovirus (2), coronavirus (1), respiratory syncytial virus (1), parainfluenza virus (1), and adenovirus (1). Specimen collection compliance was good; 16/18 (89%) patients collected all required specimens and 79/86 (92%) follow-up specimens were obtained within the 7\u00B13 day protocol-defined window. All participants agreed or strongly agreed that the procedure was comfortable, simple, and 13/14 (93%) were willing to participate in future studies using this procedure. CONCLUSION: Self-collected nasal swabs provide a convenient, feasible, and patient-acceptable methodology for longitudinal monitoring of upper respiratory virus infection in SOT recipients.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Preiksaitis, Carl M.; Kuypers, Jane M.; Fisher, Cynthia E.; Campbell, Angela P.; Jerome, Keith R.; Huang, Meei-Li; Boeckh, Michael; Limaye, Ajit P.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bd13605cb70e8bfba2e47c66f27615e52ebabfb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d96afb8361d949032ea16c358ac55a1dd927be4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4629250.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4629250?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464966/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214004120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.10.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214004120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","longitudinal study of respiratory virus infections","detection of respiratory viruses","patient self-collected swabs","course of symptomatic respiratory virus infection","following respiratory viruses","SOT patients","longitudinal monitoring of upper respiratory virus infection","SOT recipients","weekly self-collected nasal swabs","Additional new respiratory viruses","patient acceptability of self-collected foam nasal swabs","patient-acceptable methodology","STUDY DESIGN","days","rhinovirus","range","coronavirus","follow-up specimens","procedure","metapneumovirus","initial study sample","Median duration of viral detection","clinical course","required specimens","solid organ transplant","feasibility","kidney","natural history","understanding","virologic","Methods","CONCLUSION","Specimen collection compliance","day protocol-defined window","future studies","RESULTS","liver","BACKGROUND","lung","samples","OBJECTIVES","adenovirus","participants"],"language":"en"},

We attempted to develop a risk\u2010prediction model to assess the early risk of MERS\u2010CoV infection in dialysis patients. Methods This two\u2010center retrospective cohort study included 104 dialysis patients who were suspected of MERS\u2010CoV infection and diagnosed with rRT\u2010PCR between September 2012 and June 2016 at King Fahd General Hospital in Jeddah and King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh. We retrieved data on demographic, clinical, and radiological findings, and laboratory indices of each patient. Findings A risk\u2010prediction model to assess early risk for MERS\u2010CoV in dialysis patients has been developed. Independent predictors of MERS\u2010CoV infection were identified, including chest pain (OR = 24.194; P = 0.011), leukopenia (OR = 6.080; P = 0.049), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR = 11.179; P = 0.013). The adequacy of this prediction model was good (P = 0.728), with a high predictive utility (area under curve [AUC] = 76.99%; 95% CI: 67.05% to 86.38%). The prediction of the model had optimism\u2010corrected bootstrap resampling AUC of 71.79%. The Youden index yielded a value of 0.439 or greater as the best cut\u2010off for high risk of MERS infection. Discussion This risk\u2010prediction model in dialysis patients appears to depend markedly on chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated AST. The model accurately predicts the high risk of MERS\u2010CoV infection in dialysis patients. This could be clinically useful in applying timely intervention and control measures to prevent clusters of infections in dialysis facilities or other health care settings. The predictive utility of the model warrants further validation in external samples and prospective studies.","publish_time":"2018-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.; Alshukairi, Abeer N.; Al\u2010Jahdali, Hamdan; Alaqeel, Mody; Siddiq, Salma S.; Alsaab, Hanan A.; Sakr, Ezzeldin A.; Alyahya, Hamed A.; Alandonisi, Munzir M.; Subedar, Alaa T.; Aloudah, Nouf M.; Baharoon, Salim; Alsalamah, Majid A.; Al Johani, Sameera; Alghamdi, Mohammed G.","journal":"Hemodial Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b61c65fd19e460ddc6fe50085d72c5404a253f6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165861.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656480/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hdi.12661","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Fahd General Hospital","King Abdulaziz Medical City","Youden","AST"],"locations":["Jeddah","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","high risk of MERS infection","prediction model","dialysis patients","early risk of MERS","Independent predictors of MERS","high predictive utility","high mortality","elevated AST","chest pain","leukopenia","clusters of infections","transmission clusters","hemodialysis facilities","radiological findings","elevated aspartate aminotransferase","King Abdulaziz Medical City","King Fahd General Hospital","corrected bootstrap resampling AUC","Jeddah","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","validation","optimism","control measures","center retrospective cohort study","best cut\u2010off","Introduction","external samples","area","curve","timely intervention","health care settings","prospective studies","demographic","laboratory indices","Riyadh","value","Methods","adequacy","rRT","Discussion","Youden index","data","PCR"],"language":"en"},

Pre-existing airway abnormalities contribute to early virus-induced symptoms which usually remit in early childhood, whereas an interaction with airway inflammation causes exacerbations in asthma. However, the distinction between these two groups and the reason why some but not other children wheeze with viral infections is still debated. The effect of early infections on the developing immune system is also complex. The successful maturation of the T-cell response from a predominantly type 2 (atopic predisposition) at birth to a predominantly type 1 (optimal viral immunity) response, is influenced by genetic factors and the number of infections, as both are known to affect outcome. The relative parts played by predisposition and immunomodulation by early infections in later development of asthma are still controversial. These contentions are gradually being resolved by detailed prospective studies.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Nicola M","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d03773fdafb2ab6ff88b766a589c8c34790d95e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128228.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054203000526; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054203000526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of early infections","number of infections","Abstract Viral infections","early childhood","early virus-induced symptoms","later development of asthma","development of symptoms","optimal viral immunity","airway inflammation","atopic predisposition","Pre-existing airway abnormalities","T-cell response","frequent triggers of wheeze","immunomodulation","interaction","developing immune system","exacerbations","genetic factors","role","successful maturation","relative parts","children","detailed prospective studies","groups","reason","birth","distinction","contentions","outcome"],"language":"en"},

Various types of nanoparticles with diverse pathogenic or foreign antigens can help to overcome immunotolerance and alleviate the need of booster doses as required with conventional vaccines. Nanovaccines have the potential to induce both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity and can render long-lasting immunogenic memory. With such properties, nanovaccines have shown high potential for the prevention of infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer. Their therapeutic potential has also been explored in the treatment of cancer. The various kinds of nanomaterials used for vaccine development and their effects on immune system activation have been discussed with special relevance to their implications in various pathological conditions. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system has opened multiple avenues to combat a variety of infectious and non-infectious pathological conditions. Limitations of conventional vaccines have paved the path for nanomedicine associated benefits with a hope of producing effective nanovaccines. This review highlights the role of different types of nanovaccines and the role of nanoparticles in modulating the immune response of vaccines. The applications of nanovaccines in infectious and non-infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, influenza, and cancers have been discussed.

Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5\u2032-3\u2032 mRNA exonuclease Xrn1, thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses. We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases. In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1. Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription, and that gamma-herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abernathy, Emma; Gilbertson, Sarah; Alla, Ravi; Glaunsinger, Britt","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ceee8bd813092ee8fd87287b164aafb36cb567a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5e7b080a27ccef247832c109e1b1863e1515b17e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e09abcab2dd8e2fe16bb1988d6adab5b8ade3fb0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/de628dce1f0a6c46f7bee9c40f83405b1b3b4ac1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4538998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26211836/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312815002929; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312815002929/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312815002929; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2015.06.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOX","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA exonuclease Xrn1","widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay","viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression","mRNA decay rates impact transcription","nascent mRNA synthesis","viral gene expression","cellular gene expression","cellular exonucleases","cellular mRNAs","initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage","transcriptional repression","SOX","Gamma-herpesviruses","transcriptional feedback","Cleaved fragments","viral evasion of host defenses","Xrn1 catalytic activity","feedback mechanism","RNAPII recruitment","mammalian cells","RNA polymerase","promoters","degradation","response","majority of affected genes","results","nucleus"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: In this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age \u2265 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level \u003E 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level \u003E 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis. The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97). The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation. INTERPRETATION: The proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics. Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ruchong; Liang, Wenhua; Jiang, Mei; Guan, Weijie; Zhan, Chen; Wang, Tao; Tang, Chunli; Sang, Ling; Liu, Jiaxing; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chunliang; Peng, Yixiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Yahua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jianming; Liu, Jiyang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhijian; Qiu, Shaoqin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Changjiang; Zhu, Shaoyong; Liu, Xiaoqing; Cheng, Linling; Ye, Feng; Zheng, Jinping; Zhang, Nuofu; Li, Yimin; He, Jianxing; Li, Shiyue; Zhong, Nanshan","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/408b458ba27d2ed2d2b6a5e588885a82f92fbb1b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/98835457fc21346e3459f406d83a570c044a0f11.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f362a646adeaf188c296b484f47ceef1e2cd7839.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158802.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304772/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369220307108; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220307108?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","nomogram model","prognostic nomogram","fatal outcomes","clinical outcomes of patients","proposed nomogram","multivariate Cox regression analysis","independent risk factors","results of multivariate analysis","hospitalized patients","survival of patients","potential risk factors","Independent predicted factors","dyspnea","age","years","high risk","cerebrovascular disease","China","Cox proportional hazards model","novel coronavirus disease","coronary heart disease","retrospective cohort","clinical features","laboratory abnormalities","nationwide cohort","laboratory findings","current study","STUDY DESIGN","procalcitonin level","Kaplan-Meier methods","prognostic effects of variables","aspartate aminotransferase level","subjects","higher incidence of elderly people","coexisting chronic illness","sufficient discriminatory power","intensive surveillance","deaths","nonsurvivors","cumulative number of new confirmed cases","internal bootstrap resampling approach","good consistency","goal","C-index","appropriate therapy","admission","hazard ratio","prediction","calibration plots","Earlier identification","BACKGROUND","RESEARCH QUESTION","global health emergency","observation","individual characteristics","INTERPRETATION"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we evaluated parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV envelope spike protein (PIV5/MERS-S) in a human DPP4 knockin C57BL/6 congenic mouse model (hDPP4 KI). Following a single-dose intranasal immunization, PIV5-MERS-S induced neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses in hDPP4 KI mice. A single intranasal administration of 10(4) PFU PIV5-MERS-S provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS(MA)6.1.2) and improved virus clearance in the lung. In comparison, single-dose intramuscular immunization with 10(6) PFU UV-inactivated MERS(MA)6.1.2 mixed with Imject alum provided protection to only 25% of immunized mice. Intriguingly, an influx of eosinophils was observed only in the lungs of mice immunized with inactivated MERS-CoV, suggestive of a hypersensitivity-type response.

To address this gap in knowledge, we evaluated the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) immune responses to a mixed immune challenge in early postnatal rats of varying strains and sex. METHODS: On postnatal day 10 (P10), male and female Lewis and Brown Norway rats were injected intramuscularly with either a mix of bacterial and viral components in adjuvant, adjuvant-only, or saline. Immune responses were evaluated at 2 and 5 days post-challenge. Cytokine and chemokine levels were evaluated in serum and in multiple brain regions using a Luminex multiplex assay. Multi-factor ANOVAs were used to compare analyte levels across treatment groups within strain, sex, and day of sample collection. Numbers and activation status of astrocytes and microglia were also analyzed in the cortex and hippocampus by quantifying immunoreactivity for GFAP, IBA-1, and CD68 in fixed brain slices. Immunohistochemical data were analyzed using a mixed-model regression analysis. RESULTS: Acute peripheral immune challenge differentially altered cytokine and chemokine levels in the serum versus the brain. Within the brain, the cytokine and chemokine response varied between strains, sexes, and days post-challenge. Main findings included differences in T helper (Th) type cytokine responses in various brain regions, particularly the cortex, with respect to IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 levels. Additionally, peripheral immune challenge altered GFAP and IBA-1 immunoreactivity in the brain in a strain- and sex-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that genetic background and sex influence the CNS response to an acute peripheral immune challenge during early postnatal development. Additionally, these data reinforce that the developmental time point during which the challenge occurs has a distinct effect on the activation of CNS-resident cells.

As a result, the focus of attention has shifted from the approaches to VLP production to the development of a precise interface between the organism\u2019s immune system and the peptides inducing a strong immune response to pathogens or the organism\u2019s own pathological cells.

Effective mucosal immunity by vaccination should provide protection at this primary infection site. Our aim was to develop a new vaccination strategy that elicits a mucosal immune response. A new strain of Enterococcus faecium, a non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with strong cell adhesion ability, was identified and used as a vaccine vector to deliver two model antigens. Specifically, sigma (\u03C3) C protein of avian reovirus (ARV), a functional homolog of mammalian reovirus \u03C31 protein and responsible for M-cell targeting, was administered together with a subfragment of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Next, the effect of immunization route on the immune response was assessed by delivering the antigens via the LAB strain. Intranasal (IN) immunization induced stronger humoral responses than intragastic (IG) immunization. IN immunization produced antigen specific IgA both systemically and in the lungs. A higher IgA titer was induced by the LAB with ARV \u03C3C protein attached. Moreover, the serum of mice immunized with LAB displaying divalent antigens had much stronger immune reactivity against ARV \u03C3C protein compared to IBV-S1. Our results indicate that ARV \u03C3C protein delivered by LAB via the IN route elicits strong mucosal immunity. A needle-free delivery approach is a convenient and cost effective method of vaccine administration, especially for respiratory infections in economic animals. Furthermore, ARV \u03C3C, a strong immunogen of ARV, may be able to serve as an immunoenhancer for other vaccines, especially avian vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Kuan-Hsun; Hsu, Ai-Ping; Shien, Jui-Hung; Chang, Tien-Jye; Liao, Jiunn-Wang; Chen, Jeng-Rung; Lin, Chuen-Fu; Hsu, Wei-Li","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ea02653a85f4ad7fd8a9e0d7d80bf8e3be885c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115360.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.04.043; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12005749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531554/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X12005749","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARV \u03C3C protein","LAB strain","strong immunogen of ARV","mucosal immune response","strong mucosal immunity","C protein of avian reovirus","Effective mucosal immunity","effect of immunization route","stronger immune reactivity","functional homolog of mammalian reovirus \u03C31 protein","spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus","Abstract Mucosal surfaces","divalent antigens","model antigens","avian vaccines","strong cell adhesion ability","new vaccination strategy","effective method of vaccine administration","vaccine vector","new strain of Enterococcus faecium","IBV-S1","stronger humoral responses","antigen specific IgA","higher IgA titer","common sites of pathogen colonization","pathogenic lactic acid bacteria","protection","intragastic","respiratory infections","entry","needle-free delivery approach","primary infection site","economic animals","immunoenhancer","subfragment","sigma","serum of mice","results","aim","lungs"],"language":"en"},

From very significant preclinical research performed at Virginia Commonwealth University with vitamin C and with the very positive results of a previously performed phase I safety trial infusing high dose vitamin C intravenously into patients with severe sepsis, we reasoned that infusing identical dosing to a patient with ARDS from viral infection would be therapeutic. We report here the case of a 20-year-old, previously healthy, female who contracted respiratory enterovirus/rhinovirus infection that led to acute lung injury and rapidly to ARDS. She contracted the infection in central Italy while on an 8-d spring break from college. During a return flight to the United States, she developed increasing dyspnea and hypoxemia that rapidly developed into acute lung injury that led to ARDS. When support with mechanical ventilation failed, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. Twelve hours following ECMO initiation, high dose intravenous vitamin C was begun. The patient\u2019s recovery was rapid. ECMO and mechanical ventilation were discontinued by day-7 and the patient recovered with no long-term ARDS sequelae. Infusing high dose intravenous vitamin C into this patient with virus-induced ARDS was associated with rapid resolution of lung injury with no evidence of post-ARDS fibroproliferative sequelae.

During PEDV infection, the spike protein (S) is a major virion structural protein interacting with receptors and inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, the neutralizing B-cell epitopes within PEDV S protein have not been well studied. METHODS: To accurately identify the important immunodominant region of S1, the purified truncated S1 proteins (SA, SB, SC, SD and SE) were used to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare polyclonal antibodies. The antisera titers were determined by indirect ELISA, western blot and IFA after four immunizations to find the important immunodominant region of S1, and then purified the immunodominant region of S1 protein and immunized mice to generate the special antibodies, and then used recombinant peptides to determine the B-cell epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Five antisera of recombinant proteins of the spike protein region of PEDV were generated and we found that only the polyclonal antibody against part of the S1 region (signed as SE protein, residues 666\u2013789) could recognize the native PEDV. Purified SE protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice and generate mAb 2E10. Pepscan of the SE protein demonstrated that SE16 ((722)SSTFNSTREL(731)) is the minimal linear epitope required for reactivity with the mAb 2E10. Further investigation indicated that the epitope SE16 was localized on the surface of PEDV S protein in the 3D structure. CONCLUSIONS: A mAb 2E10 that is specifically bound to PEDV was generated and identified a specific linear B-cell epitope (SE16, (722)SSTFNSTREL(731)) of the mAb. The epitope region of PEDV S1 localized in the different regions in comparison with the earlier identified epitopes. These findings enhance the understanding of the PEDV spike protein structure for vaccine design and provide a potential use for developing diagnostic methods to detect PEDV.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kong, Ning; Meng, Qiong; Jiao, Yajuan; Wu, Yongguang; Zuo, Yewen; Wang, Hua; Sun, Dage; Dong, Sujie; Zhai, Huanjie; Tong, Wu; Zheng, Hao; Yu, Hai; Tong, Guangzhi; Xu, Yongjie; Shan, Tongling","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f3fc911c8b5e8366e833f19eba35a4bb5acbcb8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119268.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245493/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01305-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SD","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spike protein region of PEDV","SE protein","epitope region of PEDV S1","immunodominant region of S1 protein","PEDV spike protein structure","S1 region","PEDV infection","surface of PEDV S protein","native PEDV","important immunodominant region of S1","epitope SE16","mAb 2E10","major virion structural protein","purified truncated S1 proteins","neutralizing antibodies","polyclonal antibodies","B-cell epitopes of monoclonal antibodies","neutralizing B-cell epitopes","specific linear B-cell epitope","c mice","special antibodies","minimal linear epitope","immunized mice","antisera of recombinant proteins","BALB","earlier identified epitopes","SSTFNSTREL","recombinant peptides","D structure","antisera titers","diagnostic methods","polyclonal antibody","weight loss","vomiting","SB","vaccine design","acute enteric tract infectious disease","high mortality","dehydration","anorexia","indirect ELISA","immunizations","receptors","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","different regions","western blot","IFA","potential use","comparison","reactivity","understanding","neonatal piglets","BACKGROUND","SD","RESULTS","findings","CONCLUSIONS","investigation","residues","Pepscan"],"language":"en"},

Case-study reports on 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks have discussed the role of quarantine in the community in transmission. However, this literature has not yielded quantitative estimates of the reduction in secondary cases attributable to quarantine as would be seen in other areas of health policy and cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Using data from the 2003 Ontario, Canada, SARS outbreak, two novel expressions for the impact of quarantine are presented. Secondary Case Count Difference (SCCD) reflects reduction in the average number of transmissions arising from a SARS case in quarantine, relative to not in quarantine, at onset of symptoms. SCCD was estimated using Poisson and negative binomial regression models (with identity link function) comparing the number of secondary cases to each index case for quarantine relative to non-quarantined index cases. The inverse of this statistic is proposed as the number needed to quarantine (NNQ) to prevent one additional secondary transmission. RESULTS: Our estimated SCCD was 0.133 fewer secondary cases per quarantined versus non-quarantined index case; and a NNQ of 7.5 exposed individuals to be placed in community quarantine to prevent one additional case of transmission in the community. This analysis suggests quarantine can be an effective preventive measure, although these estimates lack statistical precision. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to other health policy areas, literature on quarantine tends to lack in quantitative expressions of effectiveness, or agreement on how best to report differences in outcomes attributable to control measure. We hope to further this discussion through presentation of means to calculate and express the impact of population control measures. The study of quarantine effectiveness presents several methodological and statistical challenges. Further research and discussion are needed to understand the costs and benefits of enacting quarantine, and this includes a discussion of how quantitative benefit should be communicated to decision-makers and the public, and evaluated.","publish_time":"2009-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bondy, Susan J; Russell, Margaret L; Lafl\u00E8che, Julie ML; Rea, Elizabeth","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a4c5c15a8bbf8fdb5694b2ce8aaf72991784476.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2808319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20034405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SCCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Community quarantine","quarantine relative","impact of quarantine","role of quarantine","study of quarantine effectiveness","benefits of enacting quarantine","SARS case","number of secondary cases","secondary cases attributable","additional case of transmission","fewer secondary cases","additional secondary transmission","Secondary Case Count Difference","non-quarantined index cases","Case-study reports","quantitative estimates","quantitative benefit","discussion","quantitative expressions of effectiveness","estimated SCCD","reduction","areas of health policy","health policy areas","SARS outbreaks","NNQ","specific quantitative evidence of benefit","literature","average number of transmissions","novel expressions","statistical challenges","cost-effectiveness analysis","statistical precision","outcomes attributable","decision-makers","impact of population control measures","effective preventive measure","negative binomial regression models","identity link function","Canada","Poisson","Ontario","differences","agreement","costs","exposed individuals","data","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","public","RESULTS","onset of symptoms","inverse","METHODS","presentation","research"],"language":"en"},

Here, we discuss the structural and functional aspects of the filovirus matrix protein VP40 and compare them to other known matrix protein structures from vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and retroviral matrix proteins.","publish_time":"2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timmins, Joanna; Ruigrok, Rob W.H.; Weissenhorn, Winfried","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e913d44d395e3e7a3d1a7d38559d8ab430bebbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127519.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109704001739; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378109704001739","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["retroviral matrix proteins","Abstract Matrix proteins","matrix proteins of different virus families","known matrix protein structures","filovirus matrix protein VP40","influenza virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","viral particle","cellular vacuolar protein sorting machinery","functional aspects","cellular membranes","functional analogy","viral components","structural homology","individual particle shapes","membrane complex","driving force of assembly","integrity","link","variety of late domain motifs","enveloped viruses","sequence","main function","diversity"],"language":"en"},

Avian influenza is endemic, and human cases of influenza A (H5N1) have been reported annually since 2006. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of SARI at a major sentinel site in the country. METHODS: Data included in the study were collected from a major SARI sentinel site in Egypt during three consecutive years (2013\u201315). RESULTS: A total of 1254 SARI patients conforming to the WHO case definition were admitted to the sentinel site, representing 5.6% of admitted patients for all causes and 36.6% of acute respiratory infection patients. A total of 99.7% of the patients were tested, and 21.04% tested positive; 48.7% of cases involved influenza A viruses, while 25% involved influenza B. The predominant age group was under 5 years of age, accounting for 443 cases. The seasonality of the influenza data conformed to the Northern Hemisphere pattern.

In this study, we evaluated whether pretreatment with SP600125 was able to prevent Orthopoxviruses Vaccinia virus (VACV), Cowpox virus (CPXV) and modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) replication. We found that incubation with SP600125 not only blocked virus-stimulated JNK phosphorylation, but also, significantly reduced virus production. We observed 1\u20133 log decline in viral yield depending on the cell line infected (A31, BSC-40 or BHK-21). The reduction in viral yield correlated with a dramatic impact on virus morphogenesis progress, intracellular mature viruses (IMV) were barely detected. Despite the fact that SP600125 can act as an efficient anti-orthopoxviral compound, we also provide evidence that this antiviral effect is not specifically exerted through JNK1/2 inhibition. This conclusion is supported by the fact that viral titers measured after infections of JNK1/2 knockout cells were not altered as compared to those of wild-type cells. In contrast, a decline in viral titers was verified when the infection of KO cells was carried out in the presence of the pharmacological inhibitor. SP600125 has been the focus of recent studies that have evaluated its action on diverse viral infections including DNA viruses.

Abstract Zika virus belongs to the Flaviridae, an extended phylogenetic family containing dengue or yellow fever, viruses whose shared main vector are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The virus originally came from Central African simian reservoirs and, from there, expanded rapidly across the Pacific to South America. The disease is an example of exantematic fever usually mild. Mortality is very low and mainly limited to secondary Guillain-Barr\u00E9 or fetal microcephaly cases. Diagnostic confirmation requires a RT-PCR in blood up to the 5th day from the onset or in urine up to the 10-14th day. Specific IgM are identifiable from the 5th symptomatic day. Clinically, a suspected case should comply with: a) a journey to epidemic areas; b) a clinically compatible appearance with fever and skin rash, and c) a generally normal blood count/basic biochemistry. There is some evidence that causally relates Zika virus infection with fetal microcephaly. While waiting for definitive data, all pregnant women coming from Central or South America should be tested for Zika virus.","publish_time":"2016-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valerio Sallent, Llu\u00EDs; Roure D\u00EDez, S\u00EDlvia; Fern\u00E1ndez Rivas, Gema","journal":"Medicina Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/409e950ca7b252b6c8788d9baa761eeecba13e24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094702.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775316300070; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025775316300070","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Un"],"locations":["Pacific","South America"],"keyphrases":["virus Zika es","Zika virus infection","Abstract Zika virus","microcefalia fetal","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 y","virus por RT-PCR en sangre","fetal microcephaly cases","dengue","fiebre amarilla o","yellow fever","Pac\u00EDfico hasta Sudam\u00E9rica","quinto d\u00EDa sintom\u00E1tico","o IgM espec\u00EDficas","malformaci\u00F3n encef\u00E1lica fetal","South America","symptomatic day","secondary Guillain-Barr\u00E9","mosquito Aedes aegypti","Aedes aegypti mosquitoes","example of exantematic fever","Centro y Sudam\u00E9rica deben ser testadas para descartar","cuyo vector principal es","Specific IgM","reservorio simiano africano y ha protagonizado una expansi\u00F3n fulminante","Provoca una enfermedad leve caracterizada por fiebre","bioqu\u00EDmica levemente alteradas o normales","shared main vector","normal blood count","Central African simian reservoirs","mujeres embarazadas procedentes","trav\u00E9s","hemograma","Flavivirus filogen\u00E9ticamente cercano","soporte","zona end\u00E9mica","viruses","cuadro pseudogripal","casos","Flaviridae","confirmaci\u00F3n diagn\u00F3stica requiere identificar","extended phylogenetic family","relaci\u00F3n causa-efecto","antecedente epidemiol\u00F3gico","pregnant women","compatible appearance","datos definitivos","infecci\u00F3n","desplazamiento","skin rash","partir","Existe alguna evidencia que","orina","mortalidad se circunscribe","basic biochemistry","caso sospechoso ser\u00E1 aquel","Resumen","epidemic areas","definitive data","espera","journey","disease","Diagnostic confirmation","evidence","onset","urine","Pacific","suspected case","Mortality"],"language":"en"},

N. meningitidis infections are a leading cause of bacterial septicemia and meningitis in humans. Antibodies to PS are fundamental to host defense and diagnostics. The polysaccharide capsule of group B N. meningitidis is poorly immunogenic and thus is an important model for studying pathogen-host co-evolution through understanding the molecular basis of the host immune response. We used a modified reverse-transcriptase PCR to amplify and sequence the V-genes of murine hybridomas produced against types B and C capsular PS. Databank analysis of the sequences encoding the V-genes of type C capsular PS mAb, 4-2-C, reveal that heavy chain alleles are recurrently used to encode this specificity in mice. Interestingly, a V-gene from the same germline family also encodes the V-domain of mAbs 2-2-B, which targets the antigenically distinct serogroup B capsular PS. Somatic mutation, junctional diversity and alternative light chains collectively impart the specificity for these serologically distinct epitopes.

The outbreak was eventually controlled by quarantine measures but not before it had caused many fatalities. The original zoonotic source of the SARS virus that caused the outbreak is still unknown but is suspected to be bats. Attempts were made to develop a prophylactic vaccine but the SARS epidemic was over before any vaccines could be tested for human efficacy. As will be discussed in this chapter, coronavirus vaccines present many challenges including low and rapidly waning immunity and the fact that coronavirus vaccines, particularly when formulated with Th2-biased alum adjuvants, can exacerbate coronavirus infection-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology. Fortunately, this problem can be avoided by formulation of coronavirus vaccines with Th1-type adjuvants that enhance T cell IFN-\u03B3 responses, such as, delta inulin or TLR agonists. Hence, appropriate adjuvant selection is vitally important for the development of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines. This chapter will describe the current state of development of SARS vaccines, the issue of coronavirus-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology and how adjuvants can be used to reduce the risk of this complication.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrovsky, N.","journal":"The Microbiology of Respiratory System Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17e72ee178b183ee417e8827681663db38f08d4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149758.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128045435000038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128045435000038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","TLR"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS vaccines","formulation of coronavirus vaccines","effective coronavirus vaccines","coronavirus infection","issue of coronavirus","SARS epidemic","SARS virus","eosinophilic lung immunopathology","outbreak","chapter","Th1-type adjuvants","development of safe","Th2-biased alum adjuvants","human efficacy","epidemic of fatal human pneumonia cases","current state of development","T cell IFN-\u03B3 responses","challenges","waning immunity","multiple countries","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","delta inulin","epicenter","original zoonotic source","fact","Hong Kong","prophylactic vaccine","appropriate adjuvant selection","TLR agonists","quarantine measures","risk","complication","Attempts","problem","fatalities"],"language":"en"},

The mutant was able to grow in a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) which is resistant to infection by the parent virus due to a lack of receptors. Inactivation of cellular receptors by either neuraminidase or acetylesterase and generation of receptors by resialylation of cells with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicated that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is a receptor determinant for both parent and mutant virus. However, the mutant required less Neu5,9Ac2 on the cell surface for virus attachment than the parent virus. The increased binding efficiency enabled the mutant to infect cells with a low content of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid which were resistant to the parent virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (HEF) genes of the parent and the mutant virus only a single point mutation could be identified on the mutant gene. This mutation at nucleotide position 872 causes an amino acid exchange from threonine to isoleucine at position 284 on the amino acid sequence. Sequence similarity with a stretch of amino acids involved in the receptor-binding pocket of the influenza A hemagglutinin suggests that the mutation site on the influenza C glycoprotein (HEF) is part of the receptor-binding site.","publish_time":"1992-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szepanski, Sigrun; Gross, H.

Here we found that quercetin inhibited influenza infection with a wide spectrum of strains, including A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), A/FM-1/47/1 (H1N1), and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 7.756 \u00B1 1.097, 6.225 \u00B1 0.467, and 2.738 \u00B1 1.931 \u03BCg/mL, respectively.

Furthermore, synthetic biologists can design cost-effective microbial production processes for complex natural products, which could help overcome global drug shortages. These impressive advances have been achieved in only a few years, and are an indicator for the potential of synthetic biology.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weber, Wilfried; Fussenegger, Martin","journal":"Drug Discovery Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b31cf3d4149415153995c8698bddf4d5c3b7788e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108258.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2009.06.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644609002220; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359644609002220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19580884/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Synthetic biology tools","potential of synthetic biology","emergence of synthetic biology","synthetic biologists","field of drug discovery","entire drug discovery process","design novel biopharmaceuticals","global drug shortages","novel opportunities","cost-effective microbial production processes","complex natural products","small chemotherapeutic molecules","disease mechanisms","solutions","great hopes","promise","target identification","indicator","unmet needs of humankind","avenues","review article","impressive advances","years"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrated that DP2392-E10 exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting replication of a broad range of influenza A subtypes. In regard to the molecular mechanism, we revealed that DP2392-E10 inhibits nuclear export of both viral NP and nuclear export protein (NEP). More specifically, in vitro pull-down assays revealed that DP2392-E10 directly binds cellular CRM1, which mediates nuclear export of NP and NEP. In silico docking suggested that DP2392-E10 binds at a region close to the HEAT9 and HEAT10 domains of CRM1. Together, these results indicate that the CRM1-mediated nuclear export function of influenza virus represents a new potential target for antiviral drug development, and also provide a core structure for a novel class of inhibitors that target this function.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chutiwitoonchai, Nopporn; Mano, Takafumi; Kakisaka, Michinori; Sato, Hirotaka; Kondoh, Yasumitsu; Osada, Hiroyuki; Kotani, Osamu; Yokoyama, Masaru; Sato, Hironori; Aida, Yoko","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65a34d151b5bc8e1e83e1def7b51b3680d321a2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111614.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217301022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399435/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217301022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","NEP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nuclear export of NP","DP2392-E10","nuclear export protein","nuclear export function of influenza virus","viral nucleoprotein-nuclear export signal","viral NP","NP-NES3","cellular CRM1","broad range of influenza","anti-influenza compound","HEAT10 domains of CRM1","antiviral effect","new potential target","antiviral drug development","replication","inhibition","novel class of inhibitors","previous high-throughput screening system","silico docking","core structure","HEAT9","region","NEP","subtypes","molecular mechanism","pull-down assays","regard","results"],"language":"en"},

One of the key antiviral factors induced by IFNs, 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase (OAS), is a well-known molecule that regulates the early phase of viral infection by degrading viral RNA in combination with RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication. In this review, we describe OAS family proteins from a different point of view from that of previous reviews. We discuss not only RNase L-dependent (canonical) and -independent (noncanonical) pathways but also the possibility of the OAS family members as biomarkers for various diseases and clues to non-immunological functions based on recent studies. In particular, we focus on OASL, a member of the OAS family that is relatively less well understood than the other members. We will explain its anti- and pro-viral dual roles as well as the diseases related to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the corresponding gene.","publish_time":"2015-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Un Yung; Kang, Ji-Seon; Hwang, Yune Sahng; Kim, Young-Joon","journal":"Exp Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bd993ed684d4c751619da3349d569b99c861e22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4351405.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emm.2014.110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OAS family members","OAS family proteins","viral RNA","inhibition of viral replication","RNase","early phase of viral infection","pro-viral dual roles","IFN-stimulated genes","study of antiviral pathways","various diseases","downstream target genes","key antiviral factors","non-immunological functions","clues","methods","biomarkers","different point of view","possibility","single-nucleotide polymorphisms","effective response","clearance of virus","recent studies","noncanonical","well-known molecule","combination","corresponding gene","IFNs","OASL","previous reviews","interferon","oligoadenylate synthase"],"language":"en"},

The cattle were infected through direct contact with an experimentally inoculated calf. All experimental cattle shed faecal BCV with development of diarrhoea, being profusely watery with small amounts of blood in the most severely affected animals, including both cows and calves. The cows, in contrast to the calves, showed depressed general condition and appetite leading to a marked decrease in milk yield. Further age-associated differences were a shorter incubation period in the two youngest calves, but with milder fever and milder decrease in white blood cell counts. These findings shed light on the apparent epidemiological differences between WD and calf BCV diarrhoea suggesting that, (1) the same strains of BCV cause natural outbreaks of calf diarrhoea and WD, (2) seronegative cows are more severely affected by the infection than seronegative conventionally reared calves, and (3) unaffected general condition in diarrhoeic calves may lead to underestimation of the occurrence of calf diarrhoea in WD outbreaks. In response to infection, all cattle produced early interferon type 1 in serum and, except for one calf, in nasal secretions. A finding not previously reported is the detection of interferon type 1 responses in bovine milk. All cattle developed high IgM antibody responses and long-lasting IgA antibody responses both systemically and locally. The serum IgM antibody responses came earlier in most of the calves than in the cows. Prolonged IgM antibody responses were detected in serum and milk, while those in nasal secretions were much shorter. BCV-specific IgA was present in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6 months follow-up. The IgA antibody response in serum was detected up to 17 months post-infection and the duration showed an age-related variation indicating a more prominent IgA memory in the adult cattle and in the older calves than in the younger ones. BCV-specific IgG was detected in all cattle during the experimental period of up to 22 months. In conclusion, WD was reproduced in seronegative lactating cows. The cows showed a more severe general diseases than seronegative calves infected concurrently. Very long-lasting IgA antibody responses were detected both systemically and locally.","publish_time":"2001-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tr\u00E5v\u00E9n, M; N\u00E4slund, K; Linde, N; Linde, B; Silv\u00E1n, A; Fossum, C; Hedlund, K.

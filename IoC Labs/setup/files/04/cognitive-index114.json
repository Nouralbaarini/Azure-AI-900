We aimed to assess the results of a conservative approach of OAGB compared with the original OAGB and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a 1-year follow-up study. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted based on prospectively maintained data in a cohort of patients who underwent either RYGB with a Roux limb of a 150 cm and a BPL of 50 cm (n = 145), OAGB with a 200-cm BPL (n = 272), or OAGB with a 160-cm BPL (n = 383), from March 2013 to 2017 at three university hospitals by a single surgical team. RESULTS Groups were comparable regarding age and sex. Mean preoperative body mass indexes of the RYGB, OAGB-160, and OAGB-200 groups were 44.5 \u00B1 5.8, 45.6 \u00B1 6.3, and 46.7 \u00B1 6.4 kg/m2, respectively. One-year follow-up rates were 83.4%, 85.3%, and 82.5% for the RYGB, OAGB-200, and OAGB-160 groups, respectively. One-year percent total weight loss values were 33.8 \u00B1 6.7 after OAGB-160 and 35.3 \u00B1 6.9 after OAGB-200 (P = 0.056), which were significantly greater compared with 30.9 \u00B1 8.9 after RYGB (P \u003C 0.001). All groups were comparable regarding remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Mean operative time was longer with RYGB than with either OAGB techniques. Groups were comparable for postoperative complications except for the incidence of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM), occurring in 11 patients (4.7%) after OAGB-200, 7 of whom required revisional surgery, in one patient (0.3%) after OAGB-160 who responded to parenteral alimentation, but in no patients after RYGB. CONCLUSION After 1 year, OAGB with a 160-cm BPL was as effective as OAGB with a 200-cm BPL and RYGB, but safer than OAGB-200. This approach also avoided the need for revisional surgery following postoperative malnutrition.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khalaj, Alireza; Mousapour, Pouria; Motamedi, Mohammad Ali Kalantar; Mahdavi, Maryam; Valizadeh, Majid; Hosseinpanah, Farhad; Barzin, Maryam","journal":"Obesity surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04681-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAGB","RYGB","BPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original OAGB","OAGB techniques","RYGB","conservative approach of OAGB","BPL","RESULTS Groups","year follow-up study","year follow-up rates","comparable regarding age","postoperative complications","postoperative malnutrition","revisional surgery","Roux limb","cohort of patients","comparable regarding remission of type","Y gastric bypass","anastomosis gastric bypass","Roux-en","nutritional complications","year percent total weight loss values","calorie malnutrition","biliopancreatic limb","retrospective study","diabetes mellitus","hypertension","incidence of protein","dyslipidemia","need","preoperative body mass indexes","university hospitals","single surgical team","PCM","sex","concerns","fatty liver","MATERIALS","METHODS","PURPOSE","length","parenteral alimentation","data","operative time","CONCLUSION","m2"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to explore the correlates of fatigue amongst a number of clinical parameters in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in order to better understand potential contributing factors and resulting consequences. METHODS Twenty-six clinically stable CIDP patients underwent assessments of motor and sensory function, disability, quality of life and depression and anxiety. Experienced fatigue was assessed using the Rasch-built fatigue severity scale and Checklist of Individual Strength. RESULTS The two utilized fatigue scales showed significant inter-correlation. Only depression scores and grip strength predicted experienced fatigue levels in multivariate regression analyses. Fatigue scores inversely correlated with strength, sensory, disability and quality of life scores. DISCUSSION Experienced fatigue is likely multifactorial in CIDP, with both physical and neuropsychiatric components. Fatigue is associated with lower functional and quality-of-life outcomes in CIDP.

Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate\u0027s health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging. Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Faheem; Ghaffar, Asim; Khan, Naeem; Cho, Sung Ho","journal":"Sensors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/s20092479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Non-invasive monitoring","heart rate monitoring","ECG monitoring","sleep monitoring","IR-UWB radar","measurement of vital signs","vital signs of people","neonate\u0027s health monitoring","IR-UWB sensors","Non-invasive remote health monitoring","vital signs measurements","vital role","respiration rate","IR- UWB radar sensor design","human body","human lungs","non-stationary human","non-invasive medical applications","wall vitals measurement","low cost","epidemiological situations","magnitude of signal","medical imaging","SARS outbreak","low power requirement","signal processing techniques","ongoing outbreak of COVID","paper reviews recent advances","robustness","simple hardware","precise ranging","multipath interferences","technology","healthcare","detection","Impulse Radio","higher penetration capabilities","victims","vehicle","macro","displacement","complicated wired connections","patient","unique characteristics","rescue missions","micro movement","infants","change","fine range resolution","building collapses","topics","spread of contagious infections","earthquakes","MERS"],"language":"en"},

It went on to be officially recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020. While many public health strategies have evolved, there has been little mention of the immune system and how this could be strengthened to help protect against viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The present paper evaluates the current evidence base relating to immunonutrition, with a particular focus on respiratory viruses. Within the nutrition sector a promising body of evidence studying inter-relationships between certain nutrients and immune competence already exists. This could potentially be an important player in helping the body to deal with the coronavirus, especially among elders. Evidence for vitamins C, D and zinc and their roles in preventing pneumonia and respiratory infections (vitamins C and D) and reinforcing immunity (zinc) appears to look particularly promising. Ongoing research within this important field is urgently needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derbyshire, Emma; Delange, Joanne","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c31d35971a69f50b14fb235e462ac2fc0c1ae91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211076.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","promising body of evidence","vitamins C","respiratory viruses","zinc","SARS-CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","current evidence base relating","immune competence","viral infections","immune system","important field","important player","World Health Organisation","public health strategies","inter-relationships","immunonutrition","certain nutrients","pneumonia","roles","particular focus","present paper","reinforcing immunity","nutrition sector","China","pandemic","Ongoing research","little mention","Wuhan","Hubei","fatal COVID","elders"],"language":"en"},

Through a pair of linked controversies over scientific access to H5N1 flu virus and genomic data, it examining the duties, obligations, and allocations of authority articulated around the imperative for globally free-flowing information and around the corollary imperative for a science that is set free to produce such information. It argues that scientific regimes are laying claim to a kind of sovereignty, particularly in moments where scientific experts call into question the legitimacy of claims grounded in national sovereignty, by positioning the norms of scientific practice, including a commitment to unfettered access to scientific information and to the authority of science to declare what needs to be known, as essential to global governance. Scientific authority occupies a constitutional position insofar as it figures centrally in the repertoire of imaginaries that shape how a global community is imagined: what binds that community together and what shared political commitments, norms, and subjection to delegated authority are seen as necessary for it to be rightly governed.","publish_time":"2017-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurlbut, J Benjamin","journal":"Big Data Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37363be031de4cdce94806e6db6bd186862d040c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221289.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7221289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Scientific authority","scientific information","scientific access","scientific experts","scientific regimes","norms of scientific practice","authority of science","political norms","allocations of authority","free-flowing information","global governance","global community","corollary imperative","kind of sovereignty","national sovereignty","political commitments","governance of pandemic risk","H5N1 flu virus","relationships","genomic data","legitimacy of claims","question","moments","pair of linked controversies","duties","subjection","obligations","paper","constitutional position","repertoire of imaginaries"],"language":"en"},

Commonly named copaiba, the oleoresin has been found to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects in our previous study, which could be attributed to some of its diterpenoid constituents. In order to find new biological activities and to eventually enhance the before observed effects, (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) and kaurenoic acid (2), together with eight prepared semi-synthetic derivatives (1a\u20131c and 2a\u20132e) were evaluated for their cytotoxic, antibacterial and antifungal properties. Regarding the gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, we found that both the exocylic methylene group and the carboxyl group were crucial for the activity against these two clinically relevant bacterial strains. Investigation of the antifungal activity, in contrast, showed that the carboxyl group is unnecessary for the effect against the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Cryptococcus neoformans, indicated by low micromolar IC(50) values for both (\u2212)-polyalthic acid diethylamide (1a) as well as (\u2212)-polyalthic acid methyl ester (1b). Apart from studying the biological activity, the structure of one semi-synthetic derivative, compound 1c, is being reported for the first time. During the course of the structure elucidation of the new compound, we discovered inconsistencies regarding the stereochemistry of polyalthic acid and its stereoisomers, which we clarified in the present work.

We reviewed the most recent literature and guidelines in this field and organized the current recommendations for healthcare professionals caring for critically ill organ transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms is increasing. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria comprise about 14% of organisms. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections are also on the rise, as 20.5% of nosocomial enterococci are now vancomycin-resistant, changing empiric antibiotic selection. Fluconazole-resistant Candida species comprise up to 46% of cases of candidemia in hospitalized patients. Consequently, new guidelines recommend primary use of echinocandins in patients with candidemia who have moderate-to-severe disease. Finally, the incidence of emergence of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection in patients is 5\u201312%, requiring early recognition and change to alternative regimens in the case of poor response to therapy. SUMMARY: Bloodstream infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in solid organ transplantation. Mortality as high as 24% and 50% have been reported with sepsis and septic shock respectively. As such, bloodstream infections should be diagnosed rapidly and intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately. Appropriate resuscitation should be initiated and the number and/or dose of immunosuppressive drugs should be reduced. Proper source control must also be achieved with radiologic drainage or surgical intervention as appropriate. Initial antibiotic treatment of these patients should cover both Gram-positive organisms, especially in the presence of intravascular catheters, and Gram-negative bacteria. Echinocandins like caspofungin should also be considered especially in critically ill patients, particularly if a patient has been on total parenteral nutrition or broad-spectrum antibiotics.","publish_time":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaviani, Aaron; Ince, Dilek; Axelrod, David A.","journal":"Curr Transplant Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db1ad0cf0c373393f7dab12fc2743b12a0a1431e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bloodstream"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resistant organisms","ill patients","management of patients","hospitalized patients","Vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections","Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria","Early diagnosis of infections","ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection","Fluconazole-resistant Candida species","incidence of multidrug","solid organ transplantation","Appropriate resuscitation","Gram-positive organisms","ill organ transplant recipients","immediate initiation of appropriate antimicrobials","incidence of emergence","early recognition","new guidelines","nosocomial enterococci","cases of candidemia","broad-spectrum antibiotics","recent literature","RECENT FINDINGS","intravenous antibiotics","major cause of mortality","primary use of echinocandins","empiric antibiotic selection","Initial antibiotic treatment","morbidity","alternative regimens","healthcare professionals","total parenteral nutrition","field","case of poor response","radiologic drainage","presence of intravascular catheters","current recommendations","surgical intervention","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","number","therapy","rise","SUMMARY","dose of immunosuppressive drugs","Proper source control","sepsis","septic shock","severe disease","caspofungin"],"language":"en"},

Yet, professional vulnerability to secondary traumatic stress (STS) is under-researched in foster carers, as is the suitability of associated intervention techniques. We therefore investigated incidence of STS and psychological predictors relevant to secondary and primary stress appraisal in UK foster carers. METHODS: British foster carers (n = 187; 81% female; aged 23\u201372 years; mean length of experience 9 years) were approached through a range of organizations managing paid foster caring in the UK for a survey study. Self-report measures were obtained on STS, burnout and compassion satisfaction from the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale, as well as on primary trauma and variables previously recommended for inclusion in training targeting secondary trauma: empathy, resilience and self-care. RESULTS: High levels of STS and burnout were found among foster carers. In multivariate model testing, STS was directly and positively predicted by burnout, compassion satisfaction and primary trauma (R(2) = 0.54, p \u003C 0.001). Resilience, empathy and self-care did not show direct associations with STS, but self-care had a significant indirect effect on STS. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the view that STS is a substantial risk factor in foster caring. While self-care is confirmed as a promising factor in intervention, the roles of empathy and resilience are more ambiguous.","publish_time":"2019-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bridger, Kay M.; Binder, Jens F.; Kellezi, Blerina","journal":"J Child Fam Stud","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96a3ddaaa5e9e980fce0ee808b698e285d0dadb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UK foster carers","self-care","foster caring","British foster carers","primary trauma","paid foster","investigated incidence of STS","High levels of STS","burnout","resilience","children\u2019s trauma","secondary traumatic stress","primary stress appraisal","compassion satisfaction","professional vulnerability","roles of empathy","years","Professional Quality of Life","promising factor","substantial risk factor","suitability of associated intervention techniques","psychological predictors relevant","increasing demand","potential exposure","material","view","training","inclusion","direct associations","significant indirect effect","semi-professional role","ProQOL","scale","mean length of experience","variables","METHODS","range of organizations","Self-report measures","domestic setting","multivariate model testing","Findings","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","survey study","female","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine an injury criterion and accompanying tolerance values for cervical spine segments in axial compression applied with varying coronal plane eccentricity. Thirty-three human cadaveric functional spinal units were subjected to axial compression at three magnitudes of lateral eccentricity of the applied force. Injury was identified by high-speed video and graded by spine surgeons. Linear regression was used to define neck injury tolerance values based on a criterion incorporating coronal plane loads accounting for specimen sex, age, size and bone density. Larger coronal plane eccentricity at injury was associated with smaller resultant coronal plane force. The level of coronal plane eccentricity at failure appears to distinguish between the types of injuries sustained, with hard tissue structure injuries more common at low levels of eccentricity and soft tissue structure injuries more common at high levels of eccentricity. There was no relationship between axial force and lateral bending moment at injury which has been previously proposed as an injury criterion.

BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing wide-spread infections and death. To control the spread of infection we are called to observe \u0022social distancing\u0022 and we have been asked to postpone any procedures which are not essential. Since procedural therapies are a mainstay of headache care, the inability to do procedures could negatively affect our patients with migraine. In this manuscript we review alternative therapies, with particular attention to those which may be contra-indicated in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

This latter purpose is particularly important due to the high consequences and cost of delayed detection of a disease moving to a new population. Quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance allows important aspects of the performance of different systems, approaches and authorities to be evaluated, compared and improved. While quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of other branches of surveillance have been available for many years, development has lagged in the area of early detection, arguably one of the most important purposes of surveillance. This paper, using mostly animal health examples, develops a simple approach to quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance, in terms of population coverage, temporal coverage, and detection sensitivity. This approach is extended to quantify the benefits of risk-based approaches to early detection surveillance. Population-based clinical surveillance (based on either farmers and their veterinarians, or patients and their local health services) provides the best combination of sensitivity, practicality and cost-effectiveness. These systems can be significantly enhanced by lifting disincentives to reporting, for instance by implementing effective strategies to improve farmer awareness and engagement with health services and addressing the challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies that inadvertently impose barriers to reporting.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cameron, A R; Meyer, A; Faverjon, C; Mackenzie, C","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection sensitivity","sensitivity of early detection surveillance","area of early detection","branches of surveillance","clinical surveillance","important purposes of surveillance","early detection of non-communicable diseases","cost of delayed detection","free population","new population","based approaches","best combination of sensitivity","terms of population coverage","local health services","important aspects","unusual increases of disease frequency","animal health examples","challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies","temporal coverage","various purposes","simple approach","performance of different systems","farmer awareness","cancer screening","patients","engagement","high consequences","effective strategies","benefits of risk","influenza","practicality","farmers","instance","pertussis outbreaks","development","veterinarians","paper","barriers","cost-effectiveness","years","quantitative evaluation","authorities","occurrence","disincentives"],"language":"en"},

One of the baffling aspects of this pandemic is the asymmetric increase in cases and case fatality rate (CFR) among countries. We analyze the time series of the infection and fatality numbers and found two interesting aspects. Firstly, the rate of spread in a region is directly connected to the population density of the region where the virus is spreading. For example, the high rate of increase in cases in the United States of America (USA) is related to the high population density of New York City. This is shown by scaling the cumulative number of cases with a measure of the population density of the affected region in countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany, and the USA and we see that the curves are coinciding. Secondly, we analyzed the CFR number as a function of the number of days, since the first death, and we found that there are two clear categories among countries: one category with high CFR numbers (around 10%) and the other category with low CFR numbers (2% to 4%). When we analyzed the results, we see that countries with lower CFR numbers more or less tend to have implemented active control measures such as aggressive testing, tracking down possible infections, effective quarantine measures, etc. Moreover, we did not see any convincing correlation between mortality rates and the median age of the population.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iype, Eldhose; Gulati, Sadhya","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb7016f89249ac4018a425f3fe645810984eadff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20073791v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["United States of America","Germany"],"keyphrases":["countries","high CFR numbers","low CFR numbers","lower CFR numbers","fatality numbers","high rate of increase","cumulative number of cases","high population density of New York City","case fatality rate","category","affected region","USA","number of days","people","asymmetric increase","possible infections","interesting aspects","baffling aspects","active control measures","effective quarantine measures","aggressive testing","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mortality rates","SARS-CoV","pandemic","Italy","United States of America","median age","Spain","function","convincing correlation","time series","world","Germany","clear categories","example","disease COVID","death","curves","results"],"language":"en"},

There is an urgent need for robust antibody detection approaches to support diagnostics, vaccine development, safe individual release from quarantine and population lock-down exit strategies. The early promise of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices has been questioned following concerns about sensitivity and specificity. Methods: We used a panel of plasma samples designated SARS-CoV-2 positive (from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; n=40) and negative (samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142)). We tested plasma for SARS-Cov-2 IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and using nine different commercially available LFIA devices. Results: ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with an RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 RT-PCR-positive individuals tested \u226510 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar. Conclusions: The performance of current LFIA devices is inadequate for most individual patient applications. ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10 days following symptoms onset.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adams, Emily R; Anand, Rekha; Andersson, Monique I; Auckland, Kathryn; Baillie, J Kenneth; Barnes, Eleanor; Bell, John; Berry, Tamsin; Bibi, Sagida; Carroll, Miles; Chinnakannan, Senthil; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth; Cornall, Richard J; Crook, Derrick W; De Silva, Thushan; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Dingle, Kate E; Dold, Christina; Eyre, David W; Farmer, Helen; Hoosdally, Sarah J; Hunter, Alistair; Jeffrey, Katie; Klenerman, Paul; Knight, Julian; Knowles, Clarice; Kwok, Andrew J; Leuschner, Ullrich; Liu, Chang; Lopez-Camacho, Cesar; Matthews, Philippa C; McGivern, Hannah; Mentzer, Alexander J; Milton, Jonathan; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Moore, Shona C; Oliveira, Marta S; Pereira, Fiona; Peto, Timothy; Ploeg, Rutger J; Pollard, Andrew; Prince, Tessa; Roberts, David J; Rudkin, Justine K; Screaton, Gavin R; Semple, Malcolm G; Skelly, Donal T; Smith, Elliot Nathan; Staves, Julie; Stuart, David; Supasa, Piyada; Surik, Tomas; Tsang, Pat; Turtle, Lance; Walker, A Sarah; Wang, Beibei; Washington, Charlotte; Watkins, Nicholas; Whitehouse, James; Beer, Sally; Levin, Robert; Espinosa, Alexis; Georgiou, Dominique; Martinez Garrido, Jose Carlos; Thraves, Hannah; Perez Lopez, Elena; del Rocio Fernandez Mendoza, Maria; Sobrino Diaz, Alberto Jose; Sanchez, Veronica","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f51b0332b4ce024515a9a7174f9bd2ab7e050da.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066407","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","LFIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantifying SARS-CoV","sensitivity of LFIA devices","diagnosis of SARS","RT-PCR","ELISA","available LFIA devices","IgG antibodies","IgG titres","IgG levels","performance of current LFIA devices","IgM","positive individuals","specificity","symptom onset","days","symptoms onset","weeks","panel of plasma samples","detection threshold","following concerns","safe individual release","individual patient applications","pre-pandemic controls","robust antibody detection approaches","support diagnostics","vaccine development","quarantine","population lock","early promise of lateral flow immunoassay","urgent need","vs","exit strategies","study size","UK","Conclusions","estimates","Results","limits","Background","Methods","infections"],"language":"en"},

We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8%), two thirds (66.9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Souza, William Marciel de; Buss, Lewis Fletcher; da Silva Candido, Darlan; Carrera, Jean Paul; Li, Sabrina; Zarebski, Alexander; Vincenti-Gonzalez, Maria; Messina, Janey; Sales, Flavia Cristina da Silva; Andrade, Pamela dos Santos; Prete, Carlos A; Nascimento, Vitor Heloiz; Ghilardi, Fabio; Pereira, Rafael Henrique Moraes; Santos, Andreza Aruska de Souza; Abade, Leandro; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Kraemer, Moritz U.

To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms \u201C2019-nCoV\u201D, \u201CCOVID-19\u201D, \u201CSARS-CoV-2\u201D, \u201CHcov-19\u201D, \u201Cnew coronavirus\u201D, \u201Cnovel coronavirus\u201D. We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%).

The early detection of this type of virus will help in relieving the pressure of the healthcare systems. Chest X-rays has been playing a crucial role in the diagnosis of diseases like Pneumonia. As COVID-19 is a type of influenza, it is possible to diagnose using this imaging technique. With rapid development in the area of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning, there had been intelligent systems to classify between Pneumonia and Normal patients. This paper proposes the machine learning-based classification of the extracted deep feature using ResNet152 with COVID-19 and Pneumonia patients on chest X-ray images. SMOTE is used for balancing the imbalanced data points of COVID-19 and Normal patients. This non-invasive and early prediction of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) by analyzing chest X-rays can further be used to predict the spread of the virus in asymptomatic patients. The model is achieving an accuracy of 0.973 on Random Forest and 0.977 using XGBoost predictive classifiers. The establishment of such an approach will be useful to predict the outbreak early, which in turn can aid to control it effectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, R.; Arora, R.; Bansal, V.; Sahayasheela, V.

Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model\u0027s two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loberg, Shelby W; Lehman, Clarence","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e19bb3185113d64145434dd493f34a58986a6ab5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056754","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola outbreak","burgeoning outbreak","tactics","cases","basic model","control","ecological models","public attention","exponential growth","individual parameters","corresponding models","basic mechanisms","number of cumulative deaths","standard parameters of transmission","classical epidemiological models","final outcome","real time","novel disease","early phases","intrinsic rate of increase","satisfactory job","recovery","inflection points of curves","effects","Covid","turn","human social system","model\u0027s","infections","pandemic","predictions","growing infection","news reports","approach","mortality","uncertainty","severity","concepts","path"],"language":"en"},

Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water. In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments. Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 \u00B0C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annalaura, Carducci; Ileana, Federigi; Dasheng, Liu; Julian R, Thompson; Marco, Verani","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135420304449; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135420304449?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["water cycle","different types of water","HCoVs","removal efficiency of water treatments","recovery efficiency of analytical methods","detection methods","low recovery efficiency","Field studies","human coronaviruses","field investigations","non-enveloped viruses","survival","heterogeneous purposes","knowledge gaps","surface waters","fecal elimination","art","sewage","close contacts","slurry","temperature","inclusion criteria","main route of transmission","surrogates","possible spread","current state","new pandemic SARS-CoV","persistence","environment","microbial pollution","research","droplets","lab scale","fate","scarcity of information","scientific literature search","days","biosolids","experiments"],"language":"en"},

We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of COVID-19 and testing practices from different United States (US) states.

Due to presumptions of poor outcomes in such critically ill patients, many hospitals have started considering a universal do-not-resuscitate order in patients with confirmed Covid-19 given a limited supply of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and the potential risk of transmission of infection to healthcare workers during resuscitation. However, empirical data on survival of cardiac arrest in Covid-19 patients are unavailable at this time. To inform this debate, we report survival outcomes following cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a cohort of similar critically ill patients with pneumonia or sepsis who were receiving mechanical ventilation in an ICU at the time of arrest. The probability of survival without severe neurological disability (CPC of 1 or 2) ranged from less than 3% to over 22% across key patient subgroups, For patients with an initial rhythm of asystole or PEA, who were also receiving vasopressors at the time of arrest, fewer than 10% were discharged without severe neurological disability (CPC of 1 or 2), and this number dropped to less than 3% in patients over 80 years old. In contrast, survival rates were much higher in younger patients, patients with an initial rhythm of VF or pulseless VT, and in patients receiving ventilatory support without vasopressors. Our findings suggest caution in universal resuscitation policies. Even in a cohort of critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, survival outcomes following in-hospital resuscitation were not uniformly poor and varied markedly depending on age, co-morbidities and illness severity. We believe that these data can help inform discussions among patients, providers and hospital leaders regarding resuscitation policies and goals of care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Girotra, S.; Tang, Y.; Chan, P.; Nallamothu, B.

Such typical actions apparently help slow down the spreading of infection. Thanks to today\u0027s broad public media coverage, the fear factor may even contribute to prevent an outbreak from happening. We are motivated to study such effects by adopting a complex network approach. Firstly we evaluate the simple case where connections between individuals are randomly removed due to fear factor. Then we consider a different case where each individual keeps at least a few connections after contact reduction. Such a case is arguably more realistic since people may choose to keep a few social contacts, e.g., with their family members and closest friends, at any cost. Finally a study is conducted on the case where connection removals are carried out dynamically while the infection is spreading out. Analytical and simulation results show that the fear factor may not easily prevent an epidemic outbreak from happening in scale-free networks. However, it significantly reduces the fraction of the nodes ever getting infected during the outbreak.","publish_time":"2011-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yubo; Xiao, Gaoxi; Wong, Limsoon; Fu, Xiuju; Ma, Stefan; Cheng, Tee Hiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5549v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fear factor","simple case","different case","epidemic outbreak","people","connections","spreading of infection","study","social contacts","today\u0027s broad public media coverage","Thanks","closest friends","dangerous infectious disease","simulation results","individuals","family members","effects","complex network approach","scale-free networks","nodes","cost","fraction","connection removals","typical actions","reduction"],"language":"en"},

Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number.

We also estimated the effective reproductive number (RE) describing transmission in the study populations. Results: Data covered 1277 hospitalized patients with laboratory- or clinically-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by April 9, 2020. Cumulative incidence of first COVID-19 acute inpatient admission was 10.6-12.4 per 100,000 cohort members across the study regions.

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I 2=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%).

Chest computed tomography (CT) scan is highly important in the diagnosis and follow-up of lung disease treatment. The present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: All research steps were taken according to the MOOSE protocol and the final report was based on PRISMA guidelines. Each stage of the study was conducted by two independent authors. We searched the Web of Science, Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL and Google scholar databases. The search was conducted on March 20, 2020. Grey literature was searched at medrxiv website. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. The adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias. We registered this review at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019127858). Results: Finally, 40 eligible studies with 4,183 patients with COVID-19 were used for meta-analysis. The rate of positive chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 was 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7-96.3). Bilateral lung involvement, pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed (GGO pulse consolidation or reticular), consolidation, reticular, and presence of nodule findings in chest CT scan of COVID-19 pneumonia patients were respectively estimated to be 79.1% (95% CI: 70.8-85.5), 64.9% (95%CI: 54.1-74.4), 49.2% (95%CI: 35.7-62.8), 30.3% (95%CI: 19.6-43.6), 17.0% (95%CI: 3.9-50.9) and 16.6% (95%CI: 13.6-20.2). The distribution of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was peripheral (70.0% [95%CI: 57.8-79.9]), central (3.9% [95%CI: 1.4-10.6]), and peripheral and central (31.1% [95%CI: 19.5-45.8]). The most common pulmonary lobes involved were right lower lobe (86.5% [95%CI: 57.7-96.8]) and left lower lobe (81.0% [95%CI: 50.5-94.7]). Conclusion: Our study showed that chest CT scan has little weakness in diagnosis of COVID-19 combined to personal history, clinical symptoms, and initial laboratory findings, and may therefore serve as a standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 based on its features and transformation rule, before initial RT-PCR screening.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karimian, Mohammad; Azami, Milad","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e2e72818f2cc44be0acea075e7e5c2d4f8efdd3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075382v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA","Web of Science, Ovid, Science Direct","Google","Comprehensive","Newcastle Ottawa"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["chest CT scan of COVID","diagnosis of COVID","chest CT findings","pneumonia patients","rate of positive chest CT scan","Chest computed tomography","Comprehensive Meta-Analysis","present meta-analysis","initial laboratory findings","study","lower lobe","follow-up of lung disease treatment","GGO pulse consolidation","presence of nodule findings","Bilateral lung involvement","distribution of lung lesions","Numerous cases of pneumonia","Science Direct","Web of Science","coronavirus disease","initial RT-PCR screening","EBSCO","pure ground-glass opacity","CINAHL","Cochrane Library","PubMed","Medline","Scopus","EMBASE","clinical symptoms","little weakness","final report","transformation rule","personal history","Google scholar databases","PROSPERO","registration number","features","eligible studies","common pulmonary lobes","research steps","MOOSE protocol","adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale","Grey literature","medrxiv website","Materials","Methods","review","CRD42019127858","PRISMA guidelines","Objectives","analyses","standard method","Results","independent authors","Conclusion","risk of bias","Wuhan","China","stage"],"language":"en"},

To date, more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and 139,500 deaths have been reported worldwide, and there are currently no medical countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease. As the development of a vaccine could require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is \u003E10 years, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. These include the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a desperate need for therapy against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Chloroquine is one proposed medication that has received substantial public attention. However, drug labeling in the package insertion states that persons with epilepsy have the risk of chloroquine provoking seizures, and this has increased questions and anxiety in the epilepsy community. Methods: PubMed (1970 to March 27, 2020) and the Embase (1970 to March 27, 2020) were searched with the terms chloroquine and seizure or epilepsy. Selected studies were reviewed, and the adverse drug reaction was classified. Results: Only nine out of 27 studies were deemed eligible for systematic analysis. Out of the nine studies, only one was a prospective study (N=109), two were case series (N=6), and the remaining 6 were case reports. The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient, the seizure was after taking 1000 mg. The strength of causality for the drug causing seizures in healthy and persons with epilepsy was mostly possible or unlikely, and none were certain. The only clinical trial that evaluated seizure risk with chloroquine failed to find any significant relation. Conclusion: Although the drug insertion label states an increased risk of seizure, the systematic review highlights that such a statement is not supported by any class I studies but by anecdotal case reports. The only randomized clinical study revealed that seizures were not associated with an increased blood level of chloroquine or its metabolite. The present systematic review should provide reassurance to busy clinicians and persons with epilepsy that chloroquine, if prescribed to treat COVID-19, lacks any substantial evidence to suggest that the medication increases the risk of seizure.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pati, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.09.20056358v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of chloroquine","seizure risk","chloroquine therapy","increased risk of seizure","terms chloroquine","dose of chloroquine","persons","epilepsy community","increased blood level of chloroquine","seizures","systematic review highlights","present systematic review","systematic analysis","Selected studies","drug insertion label states","adverse drug reaction","anecdotal case reports","case series","COVID","package insertion states","randomized clinical study","proposed medication","clinical trial","substantial evidence","prospective study","substantial public attention","reassurance","busy clinicians","published literature","SARS CoV","desperate need","statement","questions","pandemic","class","anxiety","metabolite","Conclusion","goal","strength of causality","virus","Background","patient","significant relation","Methods","PubMed","day","Embase","Results"],"language":"en"},

Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p\u003C0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p\u003C0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P\u003C0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Zhiyuan; Lin, Leesa; Lu, Liang; Du, Fanxing; Qian, Mengcen; Liang, Yuxia; Zhang, Juanjuan; Yu, Hongjie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaf0b485f290fa884dd18de71be79d86de20eb31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shanghai","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["Shanghai","outbreak","quarantining Wuhan","governmental containment measures","Findings Proportion of respondents","Differences of outcome measures","better regulation of wet markets","permanent closure of wet markets","live animals","high public support","residents","wild animal trade","consuming wild animal products","reduced exposure","cross-sectional telephone survey","confidence","random dialing","affected city","healthy diets","behavioural change","population","imported cases","Methods","response","COVID","epicentre","usual","Background","Females","Interpretation","cities"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25\u00B0 latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 \u00B0C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 \u00B0C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byass, Peter","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a789d41d9bafdf73dab3e1a6c90f46c1ce963ff9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046565","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","weather data","overall COVID","outbreak of COVID","grid cells","China","weather conditions","cell population","incident cases","confirmed cases","case data","lower incidence","Open-access COVID","summer weather","Weather parameters","clustering of cells","Adjusted incidence rate ratios","maximum solar radiation","cell-week","geo-located cases","minimum daily temperature","population density","Poisson model","Poisson regression model of cell","weeks","Weekly means of maximum daily temperature","longitude grid","total precipitation","single case","rich data source","ecological factors","ecological determinants","appreciable associations","drier conditions","preceding week","importance","understanding","exposure","day incubation period","MJm","relation","new infection","dependent variable","cause","effect","Methods","latitude","epidemic","pandemic","Background","Results","Conclusion","relevance","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

To date, this outbreak has infected more than one million people and killed over fifty thousand people across the world. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply in a short span of time, suggesting a transition from a disease free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition from one stable state to another state in a relatively short span of time is often termed as a critical transition. Critical transitions can be, in general, successfully forecasted using many statistical measures such as return rate, variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Here, we report an empirical test of this forecasting on the COVID-19 data sets for nine countries including India, China and the United States. For most of the data sets, an increase in autocorrelation and a decrease in return rate predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: a) the timing of strict social distancing and/or lockdown interventions implemented, and b) the fraction of a nation\u0027s population being affected by COVID-19 at the time of implementation of these interventions. Further, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide which is emitted predominantly as a result of anthropogenic activities, as an indicator of lockdown policy, we find that in countries where the lockdown was implemented early and strictly have been successful in reducing the extent of transmission of the virus. These results hold important implications for designing effective strategies to control the spread of infectious pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaur, Taranjot; Sarkar, Sukanta; Chowdhury, Sourangsu; Sinha, Sudipta Kumar; Jolly, Mohit Kumar; Dutta, Partha Sharathi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5f41479eb8f891a713fe548cdb7382bdce05e28.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057430","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","China","United States"],"keyphrases":["countries","infectious novel coronavirus disease COVID","disease free","equilibrium state","stable state","data sets","lockdown interventions","low-burden disease","high-burden disease","short span of time","autocorrelation","incidence curve","return rate","outbreak","time of implementation","Critical transitions","people","indicator of lockdown policy","satellite data of nitrogen dioxide","spread of infectious pandemics","India","effective strategies","decrease","onset","timing of strict social distancing","public health emergency of international concern","important implications","China","variance","specific country","increase","forecasting","nation\u0027s population","extent of transmission","fraction","results","United States","result of anthropogenic activities","statistical measures","lag","key features","empirical test","analysis","epidemic","world","date"],"language":"en"},

We find that logarithmic daily fatalities caused by Covid-19 are well described by a quadratic function in time. By fitting the data to second order polynomials from a statistical chi2-fit with 95% confidence, we are able to obtain the characteristic parameters of the GM, i.e. a width, peak height and time of peak, for each country separately. We provide evidence that this supposedly oversimplifying model might still have predictive power and use it to forecast the further course of the fatalities caused by Covid-19 per country, including peak number of deaths per day, date of peak, and duration within most deaths occur.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-COV-2) was found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum of such cases. Objective: We aimed to estimate virus release from such cases into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and what exposure can result from this in a room shared with such as case. Data Sources and Model: We combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath aerosols for coughing and normal breathing with viral sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50m3, the size of a small office or medical exam room. Results: The estimated viral load in aerosols emitted by patients while breathing normally was on average 0.34 copies/cm3 and could go up to 11.5 copies/cm3. The corresponding numbers for coughing patients were 10,900 copies/cm3 and 366,000 copies/cm3, respectively, per cough. The resulting concentrations in a room with a coughing emitter were always very high, up to 2.02*10^9 copies/m3. However, also regular breathing aerosol from high emitters was predicted to lead to several thousand copies/m3. Conclusions and Relevance: These very high predicted virus concentrations may provide an explanation why for COVID-19, frequent community transmissions from non-symptomatic cases and also high infection rates in medical staff in hospital settings were reported. Our findings suggest that strict respiratory protection is needed when there is a chance to be in the same room with a patient - whether symptomatic or not - especially if this was for a prolonged time.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riediker, M.; Tsai, D.-H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/171995ba226739b163f2866dbef682b1000976b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081398v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["copies","high concentrations","high predicted virus concentrations","cm3","resulting concentrations","viral sputum concentrations","normal breathing","high emitters","coughing patients","room of 50m3","medical exam room","virus release","coughing emitter","high infection rates","non-symptomatic cases","regular breathing aerosol","estimate of emitted virus levels","single-compartment model of airborne concentrations","COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome virus","resulting emission data","medical staff","size-distribution","coronavirus disease","Data Sources","different aerosol sizes","exhaled breath aerosols","estimated viral load","strict respiratory protection","approximation","lung lining liquid","frequent community transmissions","small office","SARS-COV","hospital settings","Relevance","explanation","swab","corresponding numbers","findings","Results","Importance","average","direct contact","Conclusions","exposure","mild symptoms","prolonged time","Objective","chance"],"language":"en"},

For indirect ELISA, CHO-expressed recombinant full length SARS-CoV-2-S1 protein with 6*His tag was used as the coating antigen to capture the SARS-CoV-2-S1 antibodies specifically. The specificity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human sera including 257 samples collected prior to the outbreak and 155 collected during the outbreak. The sensitivity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. Most importantly, in one case study, the ELISA test kit was able to identify an infected person who had previously been quarantined for 14 days after coming into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, and discharged after testing negative twice by nucleic acid test.

Due to unprecedented shortages in N95 respirators, many healthcare systems have explored reprocessing of N95 respirators. Data supporting these approaches are lacking in real hospital settings. In particular, published studies have not yet reported an evaluation of multiple viruses, bacteria, and fungi along with respirator filtration and fit in a single, full-scale study. Objective: We initiated a full-scale study to evaluate different N95 FFR decontamination strategies and their impact on respirator integrity and inactivating multiple microorganisms, with experimental conditions informed by the needs and constraints of the hospital. Methods: We explored several reprocessing methods using new 3MTM 1860 N95 respirators, including dry (\u003C10% relative humidity) and moist (62-66% relative humidity) heat (80-82 oC) in the drying cycle of industrial instrument washers, ethylene oxide (EtO), pulsed xenon UV (UV-PX), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Respirator samples were treated and analyzed for biological indicator inactivation using four viruses (MS2, phi6, influenza A virus, murine hepatitis virus), three bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus), and the fungus Aspergillus niger. The impact of different application media was also evaluated. In parallel, decontaminated respirators were evaluated for filtration integrity and fit. Results: VHP resulted in \u003E2 log10 inactivation of all tested biological indicators. The combination of UV-PX \u002B moist heat resulted in \u003E2 log10 inactivation of all biological indicators except G. stearothermohphilus. Greater than 95% filtration efficiency was maintained following 2 (UV-PX \u002B \u003C10% relative humidity heat) or 10 (VHP) cycles of treatment, and proper fit was also preserved. UV-PX \u002B dry heat was insufficient to inactivate all biological indicators. Although very effective at virus decontamination, HPGP resulted in decreased filtration efficiency after 3 cycles, and EtO treatment raised potential toxicity concerns. The observed inactivation of viruses with UV-PX, heat, and hydrogen peroxide treatments varied as a function of which culture media (PBS buffer or DMEM) they were deposited in. Conclusions and Relevance: High levels of biological indicator inactivation were achieved following treatment with either moist heat or VHP. These same treatments did not significantly impact mask filtration or fit. Hospitals have a variety of scalable options to safely reprocess N95 masks. Beyond value in the current Covid-19 pandemic, the broad group of microorganisms and conditions tested make these results relevant in potential future pandemic scenarios.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wigginton, K.

Similar findings have been described in other coronaviruses. COVID-19 patient autopsies have revealed thrombi in the microvasculature, suggesting intravascular coagulation as a prominent feature of organ failure and of the acro-ischaemia increasingly reported in these patients. In COVID-19 pulmonary compliance is preserved despite severe hypoxemia, contrarily to classic ARDS, corroborating the hypothesis that perfusion mismatch may play a significant role in the development of respiratory failure in these patients. Based on this rationale, a series of 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were treated with heparin in doses tailored to clinical severity, ranging from 1 - 2 mg/kg of enoxaparin BD. PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased significantly over the 72 hours following the start of anticoagulation, from 254(SD 90) to 325(SD 80), p=0.013, and over half of the patients were discharged home within an average time of 7.3 (SD 4.0) days. Half of mechanically ventilated patients were extubated within 10.3 (SD 1.5) days. The remaining patients showed progressive, albeit slower improvement, and both the mortality and the bleeding complications rate in these patients were absent. Even though this uncontrolled case series does not offer absolute proof of DIC as the underlying mechanism of respiratory failure in COVID-19, as well as patients positive response to tailored dose heparinization, it contributes to the understanding of the physiopathological mechanism of the disease and provides valuable information for the treatment of these very sick patients while we await the results of further prospective controlled studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negri, E.

Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of particular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms, labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A susceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the U-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral responses \\emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in the improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most concerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two models are given by two methods. The analytic results \\emph{quantitatively} describe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection, the awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic thresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the suppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS model.","publish_time":"2016-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hai-Feng; Xie, Jia-Rong; Chen, Han-Shuang; Liu, Can; Small, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad4d9c9d9590641b33f6e5b4daa6f6520006a7d6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04049v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["improved SIR model","improved SIS model","improved Susceptible-Infected","susceptible individuals","U-nodes","coupled disease-behavior interaction model","inappropriate behavioral responses","U-state","evident clinical symptoms","so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction","interplay","impacts of asymptomatic infection","emph","risks of infection","epidemic thresholds","lack of obvious clinical evidence of diseases","infectious individuals","network structure","complex network framework","suppression effect","awareness rate","dynamics","states","influence of different factors","incomplete information","particular importance","Letter","models","increasing attention","irreversible process","concerned problems","analytic results","mechanism","methods","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on PCR positivity. IL-6, CRP, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined in blood samples. Two radiologists evaluated the severity of imaging findings in computed tomography (CT) images on a scale from 1 (no characteristic signs of COVID-19) to 5 (confluent ground glass opacities in over 50% of the lung parenchyma). The volume of affected lung was quantified using commercially available software. Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for intensive care unit treatment. Findings: Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased IL-6, CRP and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts. The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients. Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean \u002B/- standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 \u002B/- 0.1, 0.86 \u002B/- 0.16 and 0.80 \u002B/- 0.1 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79 \u002B/- 0.1.

There was a strong convergent sequence signature across patients, and we identified 777 clonotypes convergent between at least four of the COVID-19 patients, but not present in healthy controls. A subset of the convergent clonotypes were homologous to known SARS and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralising antibodies. Convergence was also demonstrated across wide geographies by comparison of data sets between patients from UK, USA and China, further validating the disease association and consistency of the stereotypical immune response even at the sequence level.

Methods Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct) value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21 January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. RESULTS In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group, regardless of the Ct values for N or ORF1ab gene of virus (all p\u003C0.05).Typical CT abnormalities was more likely existing in the severe group than in the nonsevere group in patchy shadows or ground glass opacities, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening (all p\u003C0.05). In addition, the PII values in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5 [42.5-62.5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6]; p\u003C0.001). Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%) were noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme levels; whereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Multivariable logistic regress analysis distinguished three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19, including age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to 4.580); p=0.012], Ct value [OR 0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR 1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079); p=0.008]. Interpretation Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of epidemic regions.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Kun-Long; Liu, Zhi-Heng; Cao, Chun-feng; Liu, Ming-Ke; Liao, Juan; Zou, Jing-Bo; Kong, Ling-Xi; Wan, Ke-Qiang; Zhang, Jun; Wang, Qun-Bo; Tian, Wen-Guang; Qin, Guang-Mei; Zhang, Lei; Luan, Fun-Jun; Li, Shi-Ling; Hu, Liang-Bo; Li, Qian-Lu; Wang, Hai-Qiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cbb982f243a17d8cb9f47bbf9eaa186cb24a001.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20034124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ct values","nonsevere group","key-independent risk factors of COVID","independent severity risk factors","non-severe group","clinical hallmarks of COVID","predictor of clinical severity of COVID","key independent risk factors","intrinsic factors","extrinsic factors","prognostic factors","PII values","hospitalized adult patients","Typical CT abnormalities","chest CT findings","SARS-CoV","myocarditis incidence rate","viral load of SARS","value data of real-time PCR","medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients","nonsevere cases","low incidence rate","laboratory data","Multivariable logistic regress analysis","RT-PCR","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","oxygen pressure","blood oxygen saturation","individual\u0027s health conditions","consolidation","ground glass opacities","patchy shadows","ECGs","ORF1ab gene of virus","interlobular septal thickening","serum myocardial enzyme levels","Pulmonary inflammation index","total","Cycle threshold","Interpretation","Methods Demographic","abnormal electrocardiograms","RESULTS","critical issues","Background","altitude of epidemic regions","early stage","addition","time duration","vs"],"language":"en"},

In a huge and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for an inner Brazil and what can we do to control infection transmission in each one of these locations? In this paper, a mathematical model was developed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by the intensity and type of control measures. Mitigation strategies rely on social distancing of all individuals, and detection and isolation of infected ones. The model shows that control effort varies among cities. The social distancing is the most efficient method to control disease transmission but improving detection and isolation of infected individuals can help loosening this mitigation strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berg de Almeida, Gabriel; Vilches, Thomas; Ferreira, Claudia; Fortaleza, Carlos Magno Castelo Branco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/714dd1fe1309414e8b8d3c8c2e180b1dbe32e94e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077438v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["disease transmission","control effort","isolation of infected individuals","detection","social distancing","infection transmission","type of control measures","isolation of infected ones","mathematical model","Mitigation strategies","mitigation strategy","inner Brazil","regional disparities","major metropolitan areas","emergence of local epidemics","factors","efficient method","heterogeneous country","climate diversity","intensity","scenarios","SARS-Cov","causative agent of severe pneumonia","nations","pandemic of globalized era","novel coronavirus","concern","world experiences","health systems","dynamics of COVID","paper","cities","locations"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p\u003C0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs.

Methods Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82). Conclusions We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients\u0027 records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related with schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) induction is known to increase glutamatergic transmission. Thus, we hypothesized that LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma crossfrequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.","publish_time":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopes-Aguiar, Cleiton; Ruggiero, Rafael N.; Rossignoli, Matheus T.; de Miranda Esteves, Ingrid; Santos, Jos\u00E9 Eduardo Peixoto; Romcy-Pereira, Rodrigo N.; Leite, Jo\u00E3o P.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/040117480dced03655ddf0c6d2fd42dba7928e1c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/763540","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTP","KET","PFC","HPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LTP induction","KET administration","synaptic plasticity","synaptic efficiency","HPC-PFC evoked responses","NMDAr hypofunction effects","HPC-PFC local field potentials","animal models of psychosis","oscillatory coordination","increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors","gamma crossfrequency","glutamatergic transmission","electrophysiological changes","normal oscillatory dynamics","aberrant delta-high","high-frequency stimulation","cortical gamma amplitude comodulation","cognitive impairment","evidence","key brain regions","urethane anesthetized rats","D-aspartate receptor","antagonists","behavior","enhancement","cortico-limbic circuits","schizophrenia","humans","psychotic","long-term potentiation","ketamine","N-methyl","hippocampus","findings","contrast","useful tool","prefrontal cortex","results"],"language":"en"},

The accuracy of the prediction of the peaks of the epidemic is validated using data in different regions in China showing the effects of different levels of quarantine. The validated tool can be applied to other countries where Covid-19 has spread, and generally to future epidemics.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huwen; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Chang, Ruijie; Xu, Chen; Yu, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shuxian; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Shang, Meili; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Zhang, Xinxin; Cai, Yong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9548530d954b407b35fb266e2b4192402c982a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","control measures","strict measures","Wuhan","estimated number of infections","current measures","high number of COVID","peak","necessary strict public health measures","estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease","implementation of strict prevention","outbreak of clusters","high level of transmission","novel coronavirus","infectious disease dynamics SEIR","ideal level","different phases","various levels of prevention","public heath intervention","viral pneumonia","groups","cases","nCoV","early phase","dates","sufficiency","order","new estimation","locations","valuable prediction","epidemic trend","SARS-CoV","Hubei Province","assumptions of","effect","important index","model","occurrence","indication"],"language":"en"},

Design: Prospective, case series study with postmortem brain MRI obtained early (\u003C24h) after death. Setting: Monocentric study. Participants: From 31/03/2020 to 24/04/2020, consecutive decedents who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were included: death \u003C24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest computerized tomographic (CT) scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Signs of acute brain injury and MRI signal abnormalities along the olfactory tract and brainstem were searched independently by 3 neuroradiologists, then reviewed with neurologists and clinicians. Results: Among the 62 patients who died from COVID-19 during the inclusion period, 19 decedents fulfilled inclusion criteria. Subcortical micro- and macro-bleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, one decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (one decedent) were observed. Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality. Conclusions and Relevance: Postmortem brain MRI demonstrates hemorrhagic and PRES-related brain lesions in non-survivors of COVID-19 that might be triggered by the virus-induced endothelial disturbances. SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory impairment seems to be limited to olfactory bulbs. The absence of brainstem MRI abnormalities does not support a brain-related contribution to respiratory distress in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coolen, T.; Lolli, V.; Sadeghi, N.; Rovai, A.; Trotta, N.; Taccone, F.

In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to appear in the case count. In context of the COVID-19 epidemic and for countries planning large international gatherings, such as the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020, the ability to assess the actual stage of an epidemic is of outmost importance. Methods We applied now-casting onto COVID-19 data provided by the nCoV-2019 Data Working Group to evaluate the .true count of cases, by taking into account reporting delays occurring between date of symptom onset and date of confirmation. Findings We calculated a decrease of reporting delay, from a median delay of ten days in calendar week four 2020 to six days in calendar week eight, resulting in an overall mean of 4.3 days. The confidence intervals of the now-casting indicated an increase of cases in the last reporting days, while case country in that same time period suggested a decline.

The number of cases dramatically increased beginning in early March 2020. Aim: We assessed the cumulative change in the incidence and case-fatality rates of COVID-19 at the global, regional, and national levels from January to March 16, 2020, in 154 affected countries and territories globally. Methods: We collected data of COVID-19 cases using the GitHub repository, which provided real-time surveillance information developed by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins University (USA). Information such as confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries reported across all affected countries was collected from January 22 to March 16, 2020. We estimated the change in the incidence rate, case-fatality rate, and recovery rate from January 22 to February 29 and from March 1 to March 16, 2020. Results: From January 22 to March 16, 2020, globally, the number of incident COVID-19 cases increased by 276.2%, and Europe recorded 65,281 new cases from March 1 to 16, 2020. Overall, the case-fatality rate was 3.92%, with a high COVID-19 fatality rate in Italy (7.7%), Iran (5.7%), China (4.2%) and the United Kingdom (3.6%). The estimated percentage change in COVID-19 cases from March 1 to 16, 2020, was highest in Belgium (105.8/100,000 population), followed by Qatar (439/100,000 population) and Portugal (331/100,000 population). The overall recovery rate of COVID-19 was 43%; China (35.5%) had the highest recovery rate, while the United States of America recorded a recovery rate of 0.3%. Conclusion: Overall, all the COVID-19-affected countries showed an upward trend in incidence, with little change in the incidence rate of -0.20% from January to Mid-March. The case-fatality rate was found to be 3.92%, and the recovery rate was observed to be less than half (43%) among COVID-19 patients.

Susceptibility for infectious diseases like Covid-19 is likely to be partly genetic. Mapping the genetic susceptibility for Covid-19 outcomes may reveal biological mechanisms that could potentially aid in drug or vaccine developments. However, as the disease spreads unevenly across the country, regional allele frequency differences could become spuriously associated with disease prevalence. Methods: A regional genome-wide association study (RGWAS) was conducted in 396,042 individuals from England to investigate the association between 1.2 million genetic variants and regional differences in daily reported Covid-19 cases from March 1st to April 18th 2020. Results: The polygenic signal increases during the first weeks of March, peaking at March 13th with the measured genetic variants explaining ~3% of the variance, including two genome-wide significant loci. The explained variance starts to drop at the end of March and reaches almost zero on April 18th. The majority of this temporary polygenic signal is due to genes associated with higher educational attainment and better health. Conclusions: The temporary positive relationship between Covid-19 cases and regional socio-economic status (SES) at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak may reflect 1) a higher degree of international travelers, 2) more social contacts, and/or 3) better testing capacities in higher SES regions. These signals are in the opposite direction of expected disease risk increasing effects, which has the potential to cancel out signals of interest. Genetic association studies should be aware of the timing and location of cases as this can introduce interfering polygenic signals that reflect regional differences in genes associated with behavior.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdellaoui, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0dac95f48bdad41b66e55ad50dfcd5b121d4c46.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20075333v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SES"],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["regional differences","genetic susceptibility","Genetic association studies","daily reported Covid","measured genetic variants","regional genome-wide association study","regional allele frequency differences","location of cases","regional socio-economic status","temporary polygenic signal","interfering polygenic signals","genes","higher SES regions","polygenic signal increases","disease spreads","England","disease prevalence","higher educational attainment","higher degree of international travelers","better health","genome-wide significant loci","explained variance","opposite direction of expected disease risk","better testing capacities","temporary positive relationship","country","effects","RGWAS","outcomes","timing","beginning","rapid increase","infectious diseases","drug","Conclusions","biological mechanisms","individuals","Results","weeks","majority","outbreak","Methods","behavior","social contacts","vaccine developments","potential","end","Background"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction Acute viral bronchiolitis (AB) is one of the most common respiratory diseases in infants. However, diagnostic criteria for AB are heterogeneous and not very well known. Objective To identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain. Methods Delphi study with Spanish AB experts, looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis. A subsequent cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an on-line questionnaire addressed to all Spanish paediatricians, reached through electronic mail messages sent by nine paediatric scientific societies. Descriptive and factorial analyses were carried out, looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables, or with paediatric subspecialty. Results Agreement was reached by 40 experts in many issues (first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency, diagnosis in any season of the year, and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis), but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics such as the maximum age for diagnosis. The on-line questionnaire was completed by 1297 paediatricians. Their diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous and strongly associated with their paediatric sub-specialty. Their agreement with the Spanish expert consensus and with international standards was very poor. Conclusions Diagnostic criteria for AB in Spain are heterogeneous. These differences could cause variability in clinical practice with AB patients.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cano-Garcinu\u00F1o, Alfredo; Praena-Crespo, Manuel; Mora-Gandarillas, Isabel; Carvajal-Urue\u00F1a, Ignacio; Call\u00E9n-Blecua, Mar\u00EDa Teresa; Garc\u00EDa-Merino, \u00C1gueda; Calvo, Cristina; Cansino-Campuzano, \u00C1ngeles; Flores-Gonz\u00E1lez, Jos\u00E9 Carlos; Gaboli, Mirella; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Garc\u00EDa-Marcos, Luis; Gim\u00E9nez-S\u00E1nchez, Francisco; Dios, Javier Gonz\u00E1lez de; Gonz\u00E1lez P\u00E9rez-Yarza, Eduardo; Korta-Murua, Javier; L\u00F3pez-Fern\u00E1ndez, Yolanda M.; Luaces-Cubells, Carles; Mart\u00EDnez S\u00E1enz de Jubera, Jorge; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Federico; Moreno-Sol\u00EDs, Gloria M.; Naharro-Fern\u00E1ndez, Cristina; Ochoa-Sangrador, Carlos; Oliver-Goicolea, Pablo; O\u00F1oro, Gonzalo; Orej\u00F3n de Luna, Gloria; Pellegrini-Belinch\u00F3n, Francisco Javier; P\u00E9rez-Moreno, Jimena; Pilar-Orive, Javier; Plaza-Almeida, Josefa; Pons-\u00D3dena, Mart\u00ED; Ramos-Fern\u00E1ndez, Jos\u00E9 Miguel; Rey-Gal\u00E1n, Corsino; Ricart-Campos, Silvia; Rivas-Juesas, Cristina; Rueda-Esteban, Santiago; S\u00E1nchez-Etxaniz, Jes\u00FAs; S\u00E1nchez-Luna, Manuel; S\u00E1nchez-Sol\u00EDs de Querol, Manuel; Sim\u00F3-Nebot, Marta","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/138da2c92ea44a660b0d1e8732dd05de46982e79.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S169540331830314X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S169540331830314X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["electronic","scientific societies"],"locations":["Espa\u00F1a","Delphi","Spain"],"keyphrases":["diagn\u00F3stico de BA","The on","criterios de diagn\u00F3stico","Conclusions Diagnostic criteria for AB in Spain","identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain","looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis","diagnosis in any season of the year","in infants","encuesta on","BA empleados","Their diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous and strongly associated with","and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis","variability in clinical practice with AB patients","experts in many","Methods Delphi study with Spanish AB experts","consenso de expertos","Their agreement with the Spanish expert consensus and with international standards was very poor","looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables","one of the most common respiratory","Descriptive and factorial","or with paediatric subspecialty","line questionnaire was completed by","sectional study was conducted by means of an on","Results Agreement was reached by","expertos espa\u00F1oles","criterios diagn\u00F3sticos empleados","criterios usados","criterios utilizados","first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency","heterogeneous and not very well known","line dirigida","expertos participantes","pediatras espa\u00F1oles","but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics such as the maximum age for diagnosis","all Spanish paediatricians","line questionnaire addressed","sent by nine paediatric scientific","an\u00E1lisis factorial","Espa\u00F1a","puntos de consenso","resultados","pediatras cl\u00EDnicos","subespecialidad pedi\u00E1trica","were carried out","variables demogr\u00E1ficas","frecuencia respiratoria","M\u00E9todos Estudio de metodolog\u00EDa Delphi","identificaci\u00F3n de virus","estudio transversal","an\u00E1lisis descriptivo","reached through electronic mail","primer episodio de dificultad respiratoria","aumento","cuestiones importantes","aspectos","mensajes de correo electr\u00F3nico enviados","could","Abstract Introduction Acute viral bronchiolitis","subsequent cross","edad m\u00E1xima aceptable","bronquiolitis v\u00EDrica aguda","sociedades cient\u00EDficas pedi\u00E1tricas","Objective","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","pr\u00E1ctica cl\u00EDnica","opiniones enfrentadas","variabilidad","pacientes","est\u00E1ndares internacionales","estaci\u00F3n","These","However","enfermedades respiratorias","lactantes","utilidad","Conclusiones","diferencias","embargo","acuerdo","Objetivo"],"language":"es"},

The dynamics of this system is quite robust against non-pharmaceutical measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Esch, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8691e01a27cd3e8ed13729451f6f2d3f91a24b08.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20103184v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["general population","model","high R","epidemic evolution","super-spreading small subgroup","qualitative behaviour","logarithmic derivative estimations","covid","system","non-pharmaceutical measures","cohort SIR","significant fraction","herd immunity","dynamics","countries","value"],"language":"en"},

As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into \u201Cannotation tracks\u201D where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis. Results The UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day. Conclusions We invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data. Rapid sharing of data will accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, especially when researchers take time to integrate their data with those from other labs on a widely-used community browser platform with standardized machine-readable data formats, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandes, Jason D.; Hinrichs, Angie S.; Clawson, Hiram; Navarro Gonzalez, Jairo; Lee, Brian T.; Nassar, Luis R.; Raney, Brian J.; Rosenbloom, Kate R.; Nerli, Santrupti; Rao, Arjun; Schmelter, Daniel; Zweig, Ann S.; Lowe, Todd M.; Ares, Manuel; Corbet-Detig, Russ; Kent, W.

COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Methods Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case incidence and case morbidity. GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, % age \u003E16 at fulltime work/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. Results The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working and age \u003E60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. Conclusion Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources across the country. This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stedman, Michael; Lunt, Mark; Davies, Mark; Gibson, Martin; Heald, Adrian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["relative impact of Covid","practice population numbers","patient population","local population relevant age","local population comorbidity","GP Practice data","case incidence regression","healthcare resources","median practice","GP practice granularity","individual GP practice impact scores","healthcare utilisation","strongest determinants of case incidence","included population density","Average case morbidity","GP practices","national median","Conclusion Covid","range of relative HC impact","relative local levels of disease burden","local responses","healthcare workload","impact of mitigation measures","social care resources","comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact","estimate of relative demand","disease prevalences","granular source of published public population data","Office of National Statistics","key factors","equivalent national figure","novel coronavirus","SARS-CoV","model","infection transmission rates","significance of specific factors","new strain of coronavirus","community transmission","social deprivation","external infection","utilisation of health","patient engagement","Introduction Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","dynamic situation","Quality Outcome Framework","IMD","balance","international mortality Odds Ratio","latitude","Location","BME ethnicity","defined criteria","useful information","QOF","longitude","indicators","fulltime work","latest values","long term condition management","parts of England","education","country","number of cases","Methods","outbreak","humans"],"language":"en"},

We integrate highly detailed (anonymized, privacy-enhanced) mobility data from mobile devices, with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model to describe the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system. Assuming the identification of 50% of the symptomatic infections, and the tracing of 40% of their contacts and households, which corresponds to about 9% of individuals quarantined, the ensuing reduction in transmission allows the reopening of economic activities while attaining a manageable impact on the health care system.

This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until June, using time series ARIMA model. In further analysis, based on predicted active cases, we estimated the requirement of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients until June. Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of June month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in India from March 14, 2020, to May 3 2020. We estimated requirement of ICU beds as 10%, Ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases predicted from our calculations. Results: We expect that India will be having 441896 confirmed cases (95% CI: 210240, 673552), 124712 active cases (95% CI: 68481, 180944) at the end of June based on our forecasts. Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi (UT) will be the most affected states, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases at the end of June while Kerala is expected to have less than 1000 confirmed cases and no active cases at the end of June. We expect that India has to prepare 106006 isolation beds (95% CI: 58209, 153802), 12471 ICU beds (95% CI: 6848,18094) and 6236 ventilators (95% CI: 3424,9047) to accommodate the patients at the end of June. Discussion and Conclusion: Our forecasts show a very alarming situation for India in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases as India is observing partial lockdown currently. In future, lockdown might be lifted, and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tyagi, R.; Bramhankar, M.; Pandey, M.; M, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f70d160f6e37f346b7a58aa1d2e454178688f54.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20104588v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","ICU","PPP"],"locations":["Punjab","India","Maharashtra","Kerala"],"keyphrases":["number of cases","predicted active cases","estimates of confirmed cases","end","requirement of isolation beds","requirement of ICU beds","highest number of active","ventilators","time series ARIMA model","time series data of COVID","Pandemic","patients","Auto ARIMA model","Indian public health care system","health sector","coming time","World Health Organization","lockdown period","partial lockdown","forecasts","forecasting","Public-Private Partnership","coming days","alarming situation","situation worse","affected states","PPP","month","actual numbers","Punjab","Gujarat","Delhi","loss of livelihood","income","rise","ICUs","homes","Maharashtra","emerging infectious disease","virus","burden","study","analysis","Discussion","Conclusion","signs","surge","absence","vaccine","Methods","calculations","Migrants","Objective","countries","future","Kerala","Results","Background","scenario","projections"],"language":"en"},

According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential. Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features. Methods: This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19. We used STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%), respectively. The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia (61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%). The study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically severe patients. Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent. Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heydari, Keyvan; Rismantab, Sahar; Shamshirian, Amir; Lotfi, Parisa; Shadmehri, Nima; Houshmand, Pouya; Zahedi, Mohammad; Shamshirian, Danial; Bathaeian, Sahar; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/380b2622e2761481a49056abe639a4b710174808.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044057","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Web of Science, Scopus","STATA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["common clinical symptoms","clear clinical symptoms","paraclinical features","severe patients","paraclinical facilities","early symptoms","data analysis","present meta-analysis","fever","laboratory characteristics of patients","unknown features","cough","COVID","study","fatigue","identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients","confirming methods","case-series papers","new strain of coronaviruses","high prevalence of new coronavirus","Computed Tomography Scan findings","public places","investigation","RNA sequencing","Wuhan City","random effect model","bilateral pneumonia","databases of Web","Science","Scopus","Hubei Province","China","airports","cases","frequency of comorbidities","disease","border crossings","overall mortality rate","percent","PubMed","STATA","systematic review","Results","sputum","access","ground-glass opacity","thrombocytopenia","Introduction","factors","lymphocytopenia","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases. In this paper, we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented. The results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate. The model shows that the number of cases will rise to above 4000 cases by the end of the lockdown. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures. A relaxation of the social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. These results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyabadza, F.; Chirove, F.; Chukwu, W.

Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists diagnostic performance improves when incorporating ai-coronas prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCRs diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods. Conclusion: ai-corona is a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for fast and accurate COVID19 diagnosis in chest CT scans. Our results ascertain that our framework, as a reliable detection tool, also improves experts diagnosis performance and helps especially in diagnosing non-typical COVID-19 cases or non COVID-19 abnormal cases that manifest COVID-19 imaging features in chest CT scan.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of \u221248.1 kcal/mol (\u00B1 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as \u221282.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of \u221252.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning\u2013driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desautels, Thomas; Zemla, Adam; Lau, Edmond; Franco, Magdalena; Faissol, Daniel","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/673a9d33f3d75fb307b6c3ea4381b6e4a676ddab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBD of SARS","baseline SARS-CoV","known SARS-CoV","antibody designs","predicted structures","antibody structures capable","round antibody structures","predicted antibody mutants","published neutralizing antibody structures","selected antibody mutants","derived structures","initial antibody sequences","neutralizing antibodies","kcal","multiple antibody developability metrics","targeted RBD region","calculated baseline free energy","calculated interaction energy","receptor binding domain","silico free energy calculations","machine learning","mutant antibodies","homology","free energies","mole","virus","vaccine research efforts","global research efforts","improved interaction","structural modeling","structural models","novel pathogens","complex endeavor","driven designs","catastrophic effects of COVID","novel computational pipeline","silico design platform","human ACE2 receptor","bioinformatics","supercomputing","spike protein","pandemic","mutations","high-level description","viral proteins","Supplementary Materials","invaluable feedback","efficacious countermeasure","technical report","results","weeks","step","process","days"],"language":"en"},

This is analogous to the finite-size scaling, a technique used in the literature of phase transition to identify universality classes. In the disease model, the size of a system is proportional to the volume of the population, within a geographical region, that have been infected at the death of the epidemic or are eventually going to be infected when an epidemic ends. Outcome of our study, for COVID-19, via application of this model, suggests that in most of the countries, after the \u0060onset\u0027 of spread, the growths are described by rapid exponential function, for significantly long periods. In addition to accurately identifying this superuniversal feature, we point out that the model is helpful in grouping countries into universality classes, based on the late time behavior, characterized by physical distancing practices, in a natural way.

Controlling for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality, namely with high PM2.5, CO and NO2 values. In Italy, the correspondence between poor air quality and SARS-CoV-2 appearance and induced mortality was the starkest.

This atlas provides an annotated, geospatial profile of microbial strains, functional characteristics, antimicrobial resistance markers, and novel genetic elements, including 10,928 novel predicted viral species, 1302 novel bacteria, and 2 novel archaea.

We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation. Results: We described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% - 96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%).

Genetic variability in ACE2 may be one factor that mediates the broad-spectrum severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes. We investigated the capacity of ACE2 variation to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on predicting the effect of missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction. We validated the mCSM-PPI2 variant effect prediction algorithm with 26 published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein binding assays and found it performed well in this closely related system (True Positive Rate = 0.7, True Negative Rate = 1). Application of mCSM-PPI2 to ACE2 missense variants from the Genome Aggregation Consortium Database (gnomAD) identified three that are predicted to strongly inhibit or abolish the S-protein ACE2 interaction altogether (p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn) and one that is predicted to promote the interaction (p.Gly326Glu). The S-protein ACE2 inhibitory variants are expected to confer a high degree of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst the S-protein ACE2 affinity enhancing variant may lead to additional susceptibility and severity. We also performed in silico saturation mutagenesis of the S-protein ACE2 interface and identified a further 38 potential missense mutations that could strongly inhibit binding and one more that is likely to enhance binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate places the prevalence of the strongly protective variants between 12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the possibility of higher prevalence in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD. The probable interplay between these ACE2 affinity variants and ACE2 expression polymorphisms is highlighted as well as gender differences in penetrance arising from ACE2\u2019s situation on the X-chromosome. It is also described how our data can help power future genetic association studies of COVID-19 phenotypes and how the saturation mutant predictions can help design a mutant ACE2 with tailored S-protein affinity, which may be an improvement over a current recombinant ACE2 that is undergoing clinical trial. Key results 1 ACE2 gnomAD missense variant (p.Gly326Glu) and one unobserved missense mutation (Thr27Arg) are predicted to enhance ACE2 binding with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which could result in increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 3 ACE2 missense variants in gnomAD plus another 38 unobserved missense mutations are predicted to inhibit Spike binding, these are expected to confer a high degree of resistance to infection The prevalence of the strongly protective variants is estimated between 12-70 per 100,000 population but higher prevalence may exist in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD A strategy to design a recombinant ACE2 with tailored affinity towards Spike and its potential therapeutic value is presented The predictions were extensively validated against published ACE2 mutant binding assays for SARS-CoV Spike protein","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacGowan, Stuart A.; Barton, Geoffrey J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ef2d6498b16c3b3baf897f0423b2bdc2e5ab7a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074781","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 binding","ACE2 SARS-CoV","mutant ACE2","ACE2 missense variants","S-protein ACE2 affinity","S-protein ACE2 interaction","ACE2 affinity variants","S-protein ACE2 interface","S-protein ACE2 inhibitory variants","ACE2 gnomAD missense variant","SARS-CoV Spike protein","published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein binding assays","current recombinant ACE2","S-protein interaction","ACE2 expression polymorphisms","capacity of ACE2 variation","published ACE2 mutant binding assays","tailored S-protein affinity","Spike binding","effect of missense variants","s situation","protective variants","broad-spectrum severity of SARS","infection","potential missense mutations","unobserved missense mutations","tailored affinity","Spike glycoprotein","severity of COVID","saturation mutant predictions","possibility of higher prevalence","local populations","Gly326Glu","high degree of resistance","Thr27Arg","mCSM-PPI2 variant effect prediction algorithm","True Positive Rate","True Negative Rate","power future genetic association studies of COVID","Application of mCSM","Genetic variability","additional susceptibility","increased susceptibility","potential therapeutic value","silico saturation mutagenesis","Genome Aggregation Consortium Database","phenotypes","Glu37Lys","penetrance","Gly352Val","Key results","host cells","human Angiotensin","related system","endocytic pathway","factor","improvement","probable interplay","focus","gender differences","clinical trial","conservative estimate places","enzyme","Asp355Asn","X-chromosome","strategy","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

Methods 50 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection and 130 controls without corona virus infection from the people\u0027s hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in current retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems including seven IgM/IgG antibody detection Kits for 2019-nCoV (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG, D_Ab) were employed to detecting antibody concentration. Chi-square test,receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden\u0027s index were demonstrated to verify the cutoff value of each detection system. Results The repeatability verification results of the A, B, C, and D system are all qualified. D-Ab performances best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse than other systems. Except for the system of A_IgM and C_IgG, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cutoff value of other kits from recommendations are inconsistent with each other. B_IgM got the worst AUC and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, B_IgG system have the highest false positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumor and pregnant. A_IgM system test showed highest false positive rates among elder over 90 years old. Conclusions Systems for CoVID-2019 IgM/IgG antibody test performance difference.

Climate change has tended to dominate the headlines, reflecting, in part, the greater complexity of the biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity itself is a difficult concept. Land plants dominate the global biomass and terrestrial arthropods probably dominate in terms of numbers of species, but most of the Tree of Life consists of single-celled eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Wild plants provide a huge variety of products and services to people, ranging from those that are species-specific, such as food, medicine, and genetic resources, to many which are partly interchangeable, such as timber and forage for domestic animals, and others which depend on the whole community, but not on individual species, such as regulation of water supply and carbon sequestration. The use of information from remote sensing has encouraged a simplified view of the values of nature\u2019s contributions to people, but this does not match the way most people value nature. We can currently estimate the proportion of species threatened by human impacts only for a few well-assessed groups, for which it ranges from 14% (birds) to 63% (cycads). Less than 8% of land plants have been assessed, but it has been estimated that 30-44% are threatened, although there are still few (0.2%) well-documented extinctions. Priorities for improving protection of biodiversity include: improving the inventory, with surveys focused on geographical areas and taxonomic groups which are under-collected; expanding the protected area system and its representativeness; controlling overexploitation; managing invasive species; conserving threatened species ex situ; restoring degraded ecosystems; and controlling climate change. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP26 meetings, both postponed to 2021, will provide an opportunity to address both crises, but success will require high ambition from all participants.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corlett, Richard T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f387ee8b2f0d83935f85d0abe5b0eba507391d79.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468265920300354; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468265920300354?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["climate change","invasive species","individual species","proportion of species","threatened species ex situ","biodiversity loss","biodiversity crisis","protection of biodiversity","Land plants","Wild plants","well-assessed groups","people value nature","taxonomic groups","twin crises","well-documented extinctions","United Nations Framework Convention","COP15","UNFCCC","degraded ecosystems","CBD","simplified view","human impacts","huge variety of products","single-celled eukaryotes","remote sensing","protected area system","representativeness","terrestrial arthropods","geographical areas","regulation of water supply","global biomass","COP26 meetings","values of nature\u2019s contributions","food","medicine","timber","forage","bacteria","carbon sequestration","surveys","Biological Diversity","services","overexploitation","high ambition","Tree of Life","greater complexity","terms of numbers","genetic resources","domestic animals","use of information","archaea","success","way","inventory","reflecting","participants","Anthropocene","difficult concept","Priorities","headlines","community","birds","cycads","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

We anticipate changes in the way we interact with our patients and other providers, the way we design patient workflow, the way we conduct our teaching sessions and, how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of this paper is to review some of the changes to consider in clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow to make this transition smoother, efficient, and less risky for our patients and health care personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and non-clinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for Covid-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and, establishing epidemiologic linkage, will be crucial to contain and prevent new COVID-19 cases until there is a vaccine or an alternate solution. Additionally, we will have to take into consideration the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs, personal protective equipment (PPE), the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, increase in overhead costs and possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths is likely to continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or next 12-24 months. We have to prioritize surgery balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain Covid-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment and, ethical values to continue to deliver high quality economical and accessible patient care.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chigurupati, Radhika; Panchal, Neeraj; Henry, Andrew M.; Batal, Hussam; Sethi, Amit; D\u2019innocenzo, Richard; Mehra, Pushkar; Krishnan, Deepak G.; Roser, Steven M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4999972fa8d4a6d27db090474e0e14b04b34fb1a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278239120305516; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278239120305516?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical care","patient workflow","non-clinical settings","different clinical settings","good clinical judgment","accessible patient care","patient care paths","new COVID","way","changes","patient preferences","health care personnel","maxillofacial surgery workflow","patients","design","social activities","teaching sessions","social distancing guidelines","healthcare personnel risks","New infection control policies","drugs","PPE","microenvironments","high quality economical","collaborative virtual platforms","ethical values","global pandemic","proper surveillance","possible absence of staff","personal protective equipment","academic oral","overhead costs","shortage of essential supplies","transition smoother","overall goal","business","areas","quarantine","telemedicine","awareness","procedures","risk of exposure","ventilation of workspaces","vaccine","consideration","cases","providers","shift","alternate solution","transmission","epidemiologic linkage","symptoms","Screening","Abstract","uncertainties","objective","paper","opportunity","months"],"language":"en"},

Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vlas, Sake J; Coffeng, Luc E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58d20da3ef5357d091ffdcd46e09df8659f5701a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["country","nationwide stringent control","herd immunity","phased lift of control","duration","experience","vulnerable individuals","stratified transmission of Covid","alternative exit strategy","IC beds","health systems","related IC admissions","health care system","novel individual-based model","ethics","controllable way","economics","increasing numbers of cases","availability","disciplines","future developments","pandemic","profound impact","months","provinces","social activities","better drugs","vaccine","actual implementation","deaths","society","average","successive parts","area","characteristics","years","countries"],"language":"en"},

Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate\u0027s role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can spread anywhere in the US.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harbert, Robert S; Cunningham, Seth W; Tessler, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/208982a3db63c37bcf489bbaa8d6e9ad2116f491.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northern Hemisphere","United States"],"keyphrases":["US SARS-CoV","predicted SARS-CoV","cases data","future distribution of SARS","raw human population data","raw data","SDMs","raw cases","population equilibrium","viral cases","human population density","current US viral distribution","current known distribution of cases","species distribution models","global prevalence data","county-level data","primary driver","highlighted issues","link","control models","central role","partial driver","primary niche","Climate\u0027s role","weak distributional predictor","risk","Northern Hemisphere","diseases","distributions","studies","cooler areas","United States","seasonality","havoc","host","study","coronavirus","summer months","cool weather","knowledge","analyses","constrained focus","biology","time"],"language":"en"},

Management strategies for pancreatic injuries include conservative, endoscopic, percutaneous and surgical intervention. Literature on the laparoscopic approach to management of pancreatic trauma is rare and poorly reviewed. We describe a case report of successful and uncomplicated laparoscopic distal pancreatosplenectomy (LDP) for a patient suffering from isolated traumatic pancreatic tail transection. A literature review was performed with regards to the indications for intervention and different modalities of treatment for traumatic pancreatic lacerations. A review and comparison was also made between the scarce pre-existing reports of the laparoscopic approach to pancreatic resection in the setting of trauma. The laparoscopic approach to pancreatic resection, in the setting of trauma, can be considered as a viable alternative to open surgery. Moving forward, further studies with larger patient numbers will be needed to compare the outcomes between the open and laparoscopic approach.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chin, Ken Min; Koh, Ye-Xin; Goh, Brian K P","journal":"Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.14701/ahbps.2019.23.4.408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31825010/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pancreatic injuries","pancreatic resection","laparoscopic approach","management of pancreatic trauma","traumatic pancreatic lacerations","setting of trauma","isolated traumatic pancreatic tail transection","uncomplicated laparoscopic distal pancreatosplenectomy","literature review","solid organ injuries","patient suffering","Management strategies","surgical intervention","open surgery","larger patient numbers","conservative","different modalities of treatment","LDP","case report of successful","scarce pre-existing reports","indications","regards","combination","viable alternative","studies","outcomes","comparison"],"language":"en"},

The potential to induce bone formation beneath the dome-shaped membranes was evaluated through morphometric, histologic and density measurements; and the results were compared with those obtained under control untreated domes. Higher density values were observed for irradiated domes at 3 weeks, while higher volumes were obtained under photofunctionalized domes for longer periods (4 and 6 weeks). Histologically, woven bone was formed by endochondral ossification in all cases; differences in the architecture and size of the trabeculae and in the number of osteoblasts were noted between irradiated and non-irradiated samples. The UV radiation of 254 nm generated a larger bone volume fraction compared to that found in the absence of UVC radiation, and induced an increase of density in the early stages of healing, leading to a better initial bone quality and improved osseointegration.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuchuat, J\u00E9sica; Maldonado, Ysa\u00ED; Botteri, Juli\u00E1n; Decco, Oscar","journal":"Journal of biomedical materials research.

OBJECTIVES To examine psychometric properties, including internal consistency, construct validity, and test-retest reliability, of the Thai version of the International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Quality of Life Basic Data Set (QoL-BDS). SETTING Outpatient rehabilitation clinic, urodynamic clinic, and rehabilitation ward at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital. METHODS Participants were assigned to complete two assessment tools, the Thai version of QoL-BDS which consisted of three single items on satisfaction with life as a whole, physical health and psychological health, and the Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) completed by face to face interview. After 2 weeks, the participants were evaluated the QoL-BDS again via telephone interviewing to assess test-retest reliability. RESULTS One hundred and thirty people with spinal cord injury (SCI) were included in the study. Of all participants, 103 people had a traumatic SCI. The mean (SD) age was 43.0 (13.1) years and the median (IQR) time after SCI was 7.5 (1-14) years. The Thai version of QoL-BDS had good internal consistency (Cronbach\u0027s alpha = 0.89), fair to good construct validity (Spearman\u0027s rank correlation coefficient of 0.43-0.57, p \u003C 0.01) and good to excellent test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.73-0.86). CONCLUSIONS The Thai version of QoL-BDS had acceptable psychometric properties. As it is concise, QoL-BDS should be encouraged in healthcare providers to investigate QoL in people with SCI, especially in middle-income countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pattanakuhar, Sintip; Suttinoon, Luntarima; Wongpakaran, Tinakon; Tongprasert, Siam","journal":"Spinal cord","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-020-0468-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Spinal Cord","Life Basic Data Set","World Health Organization Quality of Life","SCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["QoL-BDS","Thai version of QoL","people","excellent test-retest reliability","good construct validity","good internal consistency","psychological health","physical health","STUDY DESIGN","cross-sectional study","METHODS Participants","years","World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument","International Spinal Cord Injury","Intraclass correlation coefficient","acceptable psychometric properties","Quality of Life Basic Data Set","rehabilitation ward","urodynamic clinic","SETTING Outpatient rehabilitation clinic","Spearman\u0027s rank correlation coefficient","face interview","ISCI","Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital","fair","WHOQOL-BREF","Cronbach\u0027s alpha","telephone interviewing","assessment tools","mean","median","IQR","single items","healthcare providers","SD","age","time","satisfaction","CONCLUSIONS","middle-income countries","OBJECTIVES","weeks","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS Baseline CT scans and clinical and laboratory data of 72 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia (39 men, 46.2 \u00B1 15.9 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline CT findings including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities, consolidation, linear opacities, and lung severity score were evaluated. The outcome event was recovery with hospital discharge. The time from symptom onset to discharge or the end of follow-up (for those remained hospitalized) was recorded. Data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values \u003C 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge. RESULTS Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days). None died during the study period. After controlling for age, onset time, lesion characteristics, number of lung lobes affected, and bilateral involvement, the lung severity score on baseline CT (\u003E 4 vs. \u2264 4 [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.41 [95% confidence interval, CI = 0.18-0.92], p = 0.031) and initial lymphocyte count (reduced vs. normal or elevated [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.14 [95% CI = 0.03-0.60], p = 0.008) were two significant independent factors that influenced recovery and discharge.

While cancer survivors often experience complex issues after diagnosis, being an immigrant and having cancer pose additional challenges. OBJECTIVE This scoping review analyzed research about immigrant cancer survivors of Asian ethnicity in the United States and provided a structured method to understand an area of research and evidence. Aims focused on immigrants\u0027 experiences and how findings could tailor evidence-based interventions, programs, and resources. METHODS The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies in English (2009-2018) targeting Asian immigrant cancer survivors in the United States. While 385 records were initially identified, 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS Thematic analysis of charted study elements revealed 4 themes with subthemes: (1) survival patterns, (2) barriers, (3) culturally informed care, and (4) quality of life (QOL). While qualitative studies provided insight about the cancer experience from immigrants\u0027 perspectives, quantitative designs posed descriptions and associations among QOL concepts. CONCLUSIONS Study results illustrate the need for survival research that explores outcomes by Asian ethnic subgroups and tracks the influence of acculturation. Future research should test culturally informed interventions that minimize barriers and foster QOL across the cancer continuum. Culturally tailored instruments can expedite larger-scaled studies that allow generalization.

The aim of this study was to evaluate predisposing factors and prognosis of NODID RSIE compared to other RSIE forms. A retrospective cohort study (January 2008-January 2019) was conducted in a reference center on 300 patients diagnosed with IE. Endocarditis-related events were defined as related to IE in mortality or open-heart surgery during follow-up. A review and meta-analysis of associated literature (January 2008-January 2019) were also performed. Fifty-seven patients presented RSIE (19%), 22 of which were NODID RSIE (39%). Use of intravascular catheters (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and congenital heart diseases (18% vs 0%; p = 0.019) were associated with NODID RSIE. This group had a higher in-hospital mortality (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and endocarditis-related event rates (41% vs 6%; p = 0.001) than non-NODID RSIE. Furthermore, NODID RSIE was independently associated with in-hospital endocarditis-related events (OR = 19.29; 95%CI:2.23-167.16; p = 0.007). Our meta-analysis evaluated four studies and identified 96 cases (30%) of NODID RSIE from 320 total RSIE cases.

Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic.

Visualization of the intermerdiate layers of our model shows a potential latent space for proteins which extracts important information about the bioactivity. We further investigate the inner workings of our model by visualizing the most important aspects in a protein that the model finds influential. We observed that our model learns important information about possible locations where a ligand would bind including binding sites, allosteric sites and cryptic sites, regardless of the conformation used.

The metapopulation network was used to simulate the true spread of COVID-19 in the United States, and the Bayesian inference was applied to estimate the key parameters including the rate of the number of the susceptibles and the infected beta, the infection ratio between undocumented and documented transmission 1, the infection ratio between latent and documented transmission 2, the proportion of confirmed cases in the infectious population x, and the duration of latent period (incubation period) TL . From the analysis of phase one, 1 was estimated to be 0.40 (95% CI: 0.17 - 0.54), 2 was estimated to be 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02 - 0.11), x was estimated to be 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55 - 0.78), T_L was estimated to be 8.41 (95% CI: 6.64 - 9.42). As of April 13, 2020, it was estimated that only 45% (95% CI: 35% - 73%) of symptom onset cases in the United States have been documnented. The infectivity of undocumented infectious population was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.21 - 0.70) of that of the documented infectious population, while that of the latent population was 0.19 (95% CI: 0.11 - 0.27) of that of the documented infectious population. The incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 10.69 days (95% CI: 10.02 - 11.74). We estimated that if the current control interventions are continued, the pandemic situation in the United States is likely to keep climbing up, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases is expected to reach more than 1.7 million in July and continue to grow. We also performed component analysis and sensitivity analysis, researching the compositions of the people with COVID-19, and considering that there is only a random time delay between the number of patients in the incubation period and the actual number of patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Q.; Zhu, J.; Liu, Z.; Zhu, Y.; Zhou, L.; Gao, Z.; Li, D.; Tang, Y.; Zhang, X.; Yang, J.; Wang, Q.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/335ff0d5d219b32006310322b44658099f7d287f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094086v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["CI","latent population","United States","infectious population x","documented infectious population Id","undocumented infectious population Iu","incubation period of COVID","time period","infectivity of undocumented infectious population","cumulative number of confirmed cases","duration of latent period","documented transmission","proportion of confirmed cases","confirmed cases data","early period of propagation","actual number of patients","basic reproduction number","symptom onset cases","infection ratio","pandemic situation","sensitivity analysis","component analysis","analysis of phase","results","true spread of COVID","real situation","serious pandemic","different phases","random time delay","different categories of communicators","infected beta","epidemic","follow-up trend","rate","susceptibles","compositions","TL","Bayesian inference","current control interventions","key parameters","proposed model","numbers","normalized contributions","country","world","people","metapopulation network","days","R0"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted. Antibody and epitope profiling in response to COVID-19 is possible with our peptide-based SARS-COV-2 proteome microarray. The data gleaned from the array could provide invaluable information to the scientific community to understand, detect, and treat COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hongye; Hou, Xin; Wu, Xian; Liang, Te; Zhang, Xiaomei; Wang, Dan; Teng, Fei; Dai, Jiayu; Duan, Hu; Guo, Shubin; Li, Yongzhe; Yu, Xiaobo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.994756","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","full-length SARS-CoV","propagation of SARS","peptide-based SARS-COV","proteins","proteome array","IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS","proteome microarray","antibody interactions","humoral antibody response","amino acid resolution","amino acids","amino acid offsets","immune response","serological antibodies","proteome-wide analysis","epitope biomarkers","array processing time","social interactions","epitope profiling","available reagents","spotting peptides","viral entry","hours","host cells","diagnosis","insight","lowest limit of detection","orders of magnitude","invaluable information","IgM","potential targets","dynamic range","ACE2 receptor","scientific community","pg","economy","education","vaccine development","serum","immuno-proteomics platform","patients","worldwide pandemic","data","investigation","infection","research","need"],"language":"en"},

Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However, clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 between February 23th and April 4th, 2020, at the Central Defense Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Subcutaneous interferon beta-1b was recommended in moderate-severe pneumonia. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality. Findings We analyzed 256 patients (106 patients in interferon group and 150 patients in control group). At admission, patients who did not receive interferon beta1b presented a greater number of comorbidities. The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63/256). Twenty-two patients (20.8%) in the interferon group died and 41 (27.3%) in the control group (p=0.229). In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age, severity of clinical picture at admission and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Interpretation In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, interferon beta1b treatment was not associated to decrease in-hospital mortality. Further assessment of the earlier administration of this drug in randomized trials is recommended.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Estebanez, M.; Martinez-Oliveira, G.; Mata, T.; Marti, D.; Gutierrez, C.; De Dios, B.; Dolores Herrero, M.; Roel, A.; Martinez, Y.; Aguirre, A.; Alcantara Nicolas, F.; Fernandez Gonzalez, P.; Lopez, E.; Ballester, L.

Aim: To monitor patient volumes, demographics and outcomes at the North-East urgent dental care service and confirm appropriate care pathways. Main Outcome Methods: Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23rd March to 3rd May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics. Results: There were 1746 patient triages, (1595 telephone and 151 face-to-face) resulting in 1322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were: symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. 65% of clinical consultations resulted in extractions, 0.5% an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25km on average to access care, however this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and to our knowledge no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure. Conclusion: The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the 6-week period. Dental preparedness for future pandemic crisis could be improved and informed by this data.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carter, E.; Currie, C.; Asuni, A.; Goldsmith, R.; Toon, G.; Horridge, C.; Simpson, S.; Donnell, C.; Greenwood, M.; Walton, G.; Cole, B.; Durham, J.; Holliday, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb209cb5e8e16b0f79f21ca9e54a795839634443.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20093179v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["urgent dental care centre","establishment of urgent dental care","provision of urgent dental care","urgent care centres","emergency dental care","North-East urgent dental care service","appropriate care pathways","Dental preparedness","appropriate patient pathways","patient triages","patient volumes","majority of patients","Data","week period","clinical consultations","key characteristics of patients","North-East of England","asymptomatic of COVID","prospective service evaluation","future pandemic crisis","outcomes","symptomatic irreversible pulpitis","demographics","staff","infection","common diagnoses","apical periodontitis","challenges","Conclusion","Main Outcome Methods","occupational exposure","knowledge","paper","extractions","Analysis","descriptive statistics","aerosol","Results","telephone","Introduction","average","procedure"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE To synthesise qualitative research exploring the experiences and perspectives of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), relatives and health professionals concerning goal setting in SCI rehabilitation. METHODS Five electronic databases were searched. A search strategy was constructed with key concepts identified using PICo (Population, phenomena of Interest and Context). Peer reviewed studies complying with the inclusion criteria were selected. Interpretive Description methodology guided analysis and synthesis of the findings. RESULTS The search yielded 427 records. Of 12 full text studies assessed for eligibility, four were included describing goal setting in SCI rehabilitation from the perspective of persons with SCI and health professionals. Persons with SCI described a need for goal setting to be related to their everyday life, whereas the health professionals tended to use the hospital setting as their point of reference. Persons with SCI emphasised the importance of being self-directed and taking an active role in goal setting and rehabilitation. No studies presented the perspective of relatives. CONCLUSIONS This review illuminates the divergence in the understanding of goal setting between persons with SCI and health professionals. Goal setting in SCI rehabilitation often directly reflects physical functioning goals set by the health professionals, which does not prepare persons with SCI for everyday life and emotional issues. There is lack of focus on goals addressing psychosocial components such as family issues and change of roles. A shared process with goal setting relevant to persons with SCI and their everyday life is needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maribo, Thomas; Jensen, Charlotte Maria; Madsen, Louise Sofia; Handberg, Charlotte","journal":"Spinal cord","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-020-0485-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SCI rehabilitation","understanding of goal setting","health professionals","perspective of persons","perspectives of persons","everyday life","text studies","perspective of relatives","Peer reviewed studies","STUDY DESIGN Systematic review of qualitative studies","qualitative research","family issues","emotional issues","search strategy","physical functioning goals","synthesis","spinal cord injury","Interpretive Description methodology guided analysis","Population","key concepts","psychosocial components","experiences","divergence","active role","PICo","hospital","inclusion criteria","shared process","phenomena","findings","focus","eligibility","importance","need","METHODS","electronic databases","point of reference","Context","OBJECTIVE","roles","CONCLUSIONS","records"],"language":"en"},

A total of 82 patients with stage I-II (FIGO 2014) ovarian clear cell carcinoma undergoing primary surgery at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2017 were enrolled.

The overall survival was significantly shorter in the PNI-low group than in the PNI-high group. Multivariate analysis showed that high PNI was a significant independent prognostic factor for favorable prognosis (hazard ratio = 0.102, p = 0.010). There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.220), but the postrecurrence survival was significantly longer in the PNI-high group than in the PNI-low group (p = 0.0383).

METHODS A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. CONCLUSION Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Si Heng Sharon; Hong, Choon Chiet; Saha, Soura; Murphy, Diarmuid; Hui, James Hoipo","journal":"International orthopaedics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04643-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","patients","systemic steroids","common orthopaedic antibiotics","vitamin D","vitamin B","vitamin C","potential implications","potential impact","orthopaedic surgery","common medications","orthopaedic surgeons","systematic review","vitamins B","clinical studies","line of analgesia","use of analgesia","PRISMA guidelines","usual clinical practice","possible avascular necrosis","clindamycin","anticoagulants","immunosuppression","penicillin","anti-inflammatories","current literature","addition","reviews","consensus","summary","respiratory depression","oral anticoagulation","tetracyclines","organisms","main recommendations","macrolides","prescription","NSAIDs","parental heparin","CONCLUSION","paracetamol","antipyretic","METHODS","opioids","need","conditions","care","total","articles","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms. The new CoV-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome. If CoV-19 would spread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths. Moreover, people from the poorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities. To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and the collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission. In the case of a pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals. At present, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death. One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone. It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected. In addition, germicidal UV radiation \u0022breaks down\u0022 the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration. All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk of infection by CoV-19. New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration. For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis. Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19. We strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conti, P; Gallenga, C E; Tet\u00E8, G; Caraffa, Al; Ronconi, G; Younes, A; Toniato, E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K","journal":"Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23812/editorial-conti-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new CoV","aggravation of CoV","SARS-CoV","risk of infection","IL","COVID","consideration","viral replication","viral transmission","new drugs","serious infection","New anti-viral therapies","health system","oxygen O2","immune system","pulmonary fibrosis","people","severe acute respiratory diseases","lower respiratory tract","large number of individuals","ozone layer","drug capable","RNA virus","immune genes","normal flu","severe shortage of respirators","bacterial infectious diseases","lack of health care","higher incidence rate","protective clothing","molecules","bronchitis","mixture of gaseous hydrogen","enormous demand","better results","reduction","period","pandemic","mediator of fever","pleiotropic cytokine","month","order","home","O3","mortality","insufficient production","pneumonia","spreads","collapse","poorest classes","germicidal UV radiation","assistance","greater survival","addition","closed communities","quarantine","treatments","lung respiration","efficiency","inflammation","patients","population","treatment of rheumatoid arthritis","X chromosome","microbes","competent authorities","islands","therapeutic remedies","present","case","TLR","causes of death","example","severity","devices","effects","precautions","symptoms","deaths"],"language":"en"},

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via human respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1-3. This study investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients\u0027 toilet areas. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas was undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions showing peaks in submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions, but these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols.

Objective: To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Methods and Results: This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to nine hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. Unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (3.7% vs. 9.8%; P = 0.01). In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; P =0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared to use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01) in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Peng; Zhu, LiHua; Cai, Jingjing; Lei, Fang; Qin, Juan-Juan; Xie, Jing; Liu, Ye-Mao; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Huang, Xuewei; Lin, Lijin; Xia, Meng; Chen, Ming-Ming; Cheng, Xu; Zhang, Xiao; Guo, Deliang; Peng, Yuanyuan; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Chen, Jing; She, Zhi-Gang; Wang, Yibin; Xu, Qingbo; Tan, Renfu; Wang, Haitao; Lin, Jun; Luo, Pengcheng; Fu, Shouzhi; Cai, Hongbin; Ye, Ping; Xiao, Bing; Mao, Weiming; Liu, Liming; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Mingyu; Chen, Manhua; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Touyz, Rhian M; Xia, Jiahong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Huang, Xiaodong; Yuan, Yufeng; Rohit, Loomba; Liu, Peter P; Li, Hongliang","journal":"Circulation research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.120.317134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACEI/ARB"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ARB group","non-ACEI","hospital use of ACEI","inpatient use of ACEI","ARB non-users","hypertension","lower risk of COVID","lower risk of all-cause mortality","decreased mortality","increased mortality risk","Use of angiotensin","hospitalized COVID","adult patients","Unadjusted mortality rate","adjusted HR","median age","detected risk","mixed-effect Cox model","Results","random effect","hospital medications","IQR","men","subgroup propensity score-matched analysis","study interpretation","multi-center study","imbalanced variables","ACEIs","site","major concern","ARBs","retrospective","clinicians","coronavirus disease","enzyme inhibitors","receptor blockers","potential","comorbidities","antihypertensive drugs","hospitals","Hubei Province","China","residual confounders","association","Methods","gender","years","Conclusions","Rationale","Objective"],"language":"en"},

We recently demonstrated that exchanging functionally altered endogenous microglia with peripheral myeloid cells did not change A\u03B2-burden in a mouse model mimicking aspects of AD at baseline, and only mildly reduced A\u03B2 plaques upon stimulation. To better characterize these different myeloid cell populations, we used long-term in vivo 2-photon microscopy to compare morphology and basic functional parameters of brain populating peripherally-derived myeloid cells and endogenous microglia. While peripherally-derived myeloid cells exhibited increased process movement in the non-diseased brain, the A\u03B2 rich environment in an AD-like mouse model, which induced an alteration of surveillance functions in endogenous microglia, also restricted functional characteristics and response to CNS injury of newly recruited peripherally-derived myeloid cells.

Seroma formation is a common complication of LVHR. The aim of this study is to review the current evidence on seroma prevention strategies following LVHR. METHODS A systematic search of PubMed, Embase (1946-13 February 2019) and Medline (1946-13 February 2019) databases was conducted using terms which include \u0022seroma\u0022, \u0022hernia, ventral\u0022 and \u0022laparoscopy\u0022. All studies are comparative retrospective or prospective human adult studies in peer-reviewed journals describing at least one intra-operative intervention designed to decrease the rate of seroma formation in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. RESULTS The database searches identified 3762 citations, and 21 studies were included for final analysis. Five studies compared the different methods of mesh fixation, nine studies compared primary defect closure (PFC) and bridged repair, two studies compared the effect of different types of meshes, two studies looked into the use of electrical cauterization, one study compared single- site laparoscopy with conventional laparoscopy, one study looked into the use of fibrin sealant and one study compared transabdominal preperitoneal placement of mesh with conventional repair. PFC appears to be the most promising with large studies showing a low rate of seroma formation with additional benefits of decreasing wound infection and recurrence rate. Cauterisation of hernia sac and injection of fibrin sealant also show promising results but are mainly derived from small studies. Other strategies did not demonstrate benefit. CONCLUSION Currently, primary fascial closure appears to be the most promising strategy available to decrease seroma formation after LVHR based on the results of large studies. Other promising strategies that decrease dead space such as cauterisation of the sac and fibrin sealant injection will require further multicentre trials to confirm benefit before an increase in operative time and cost can be justified for their routine use.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, C; Lu, J; Ong, M W; Lee, D J K; Tan, K Y; Chia, C L K","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-02098-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LVHR","PFC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["small studies","results of large studies","study","low rate of seroma formation","promising strategies","promising results","seroma prevention strategies","prospective human adult studies","conventional repair","use of fibrin sealant","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair","injection of fibrin sealant","fibrin sealant injection","Cauterisation of hernia sac","bridged repair","conventional laparoscopy","recurrence rate","common complication of LVHR","promising strategy available","PFC","routine use","different methods of mesh fixation","primary defect closure","single- site laparoscopy","primary fascial closure","use of electrical cauterization","operative time","intra-operative intervention","effect of different types","transabdominal preperitoneal placement of mesh","additional benefits of decreasing wound infection","peer-reviewed journals","comparative retrospective","current evidence","increase","multicentre trials","dead space","systematic search of PubMed","cost","Embase","CONCLUSION","citations","database searches","popularity","terms","final analysis","years","databases","aim","Medline"],"language":"en"},

The current study aimed to repurpose stilbenoid analogs, reported for some other biological activities, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex for their affinity and stability using molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis based on molecular docking. Four compounds in total were probed for their binding affinity using molecular docking. All of the compounds showed good affinity (\u003E -7 kcal/mol). However, fifty nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation in aqueous solution revealed highly stable bound conformation of resveratrol to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex. Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex. Based on the results, we report that stilbene based compounds in general and resveratrol, in particular, can be promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike protein.

Since nowadays no specific drug therapies neither vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19, drug repositioning may offer a strategy to efficiently control the clinical course of the disease and the spread of the outbreak. In this paper we aim to describe the main pharmacological properties, including data on mechanism of action, safety concerns and drug-drug interactions, of drugs currently administered in patients with COVID-19, focusing on antivirals and drugs with immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 were reported. Several studies have been registered worldwide and a number of drugs were repurposed to face the new health emergency of COVID-19. For many of these drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit in improving patients\u0027 clinical conditions. However, adequate clinical trials are necessary to reach any firm conclusion on the efficacy and safety profiles of these compounds. Even though drug repurposing is necessary, it requires caution. Too many drugs that are currently tested in patients with COVID-19 have peculiar safety profiles. In conclusion, while waiting for the development of effective preventive measures, such as vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. It is conceivable that very soon their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scavone, Cristina; Brusco, Simona; Bertini, Michele; Sportiello, Liberata; Rafaniello, Concetta; Zoccoli, Alice; Berrino, Liberato; Racagni, Giorgio; Rossi, Francesco; Capuano, Annalisa","journal":"British journal of pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","preliminary clinical trials","drug-drug interactions","adequate clinical trials","clinical course","number of drugs","drug repurposing","drug repositioning","causing agent of COVID","patients\u0027 clinical conditions","new health emergency of COVID","specific drug therapies","vaccines","safety concerns","data","peculiar safety profiles","spread","firm conclusion","anti-inflammatory properties","main pharmacological properties","favipiravir","tocilizumab","mechanism of action","remdesivir","ritonavir","efficacy","different therapeutic classes","benefit","immune-modulatory","development of effective preventive measures","lopinavir","disease","strategy","antivirals","compounds","novel SARS-Cov","outbreak","caution","symptoms","best way","results","complications","world","paper","studies"],"language":"en"},

The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 \u00B1 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 \u00B1 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 \u00B1 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 \u00B1 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device.

An understanding of injury epidemiology in twenty-first century armed conflict is required to plan humanitarian trauma systems capable of responding to population needs. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, World Health Organization Catalog, Google Scholar) and grey literature repositories to identify records that described conflict-related injuries sustained by civilians and local combatants since 2001. RESULTS The search returned 3501 records. 49 reports representing conflicts in 18 countries were included in the analysis and described injuries of 58,578 patients. 79.3% of patients were male, and 34.7% were under age 18 years. Blast injury was the predominant mechanism (50.2%), and extremities were the most common anatomic region of injury (33.5%). The heterogeneity and lack of reporting of data elements prevented pooled analysis and limited the generalizability of the results. For example, data elements including measures of injury severity, resource utilization (ventilator support, transfusion, surgery), and outcomes other than mortality (disability, quality of life measures) were presented by fewer than 25% of reports. CONCLUSIONS Data describing the needs of civilians and local combatants injured during conflict are currently inadequate to inform the development of humanitarian trauma systems. To guide system-wide capacity building and quality improvement, we advocate for a humanitarian trauma registry with a minimum set of data elements.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wild, Hannah; Stewart, Barclay T; LeBoa, Christopher; Stave, Christopher D; Wren, Sherry M","journal":"World journal of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05428-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32100067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization Catalog"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["local combatants","BACKGROUND Conflict-related injuries","Blast injury","CONCLUSIONS Data","needs of civilians","measures of injury severity","humanitarian trauma registry","minimum set of data elements","humanitarian trauma systems capable","development of humanitarian trauma systems","century armed conflict","understanding of injury epidemiology","records","reports","patients","results","common anatomic region of injury","quality of life measures","quality improvement","pooled analysis","systematic search of databases","World Health Organization Catalog","North Atlantic Treaty Organization","Google Scholar","resource utilization","ventilator support","Web of Science","transfusion","grey literature repositories","Embase","PubMed","coalition military personnel","disability","lack of reporting","system-wide capacity building","outcomes","surgery","mortality","extremities","predominant mechanism","heterogeneity","countries","generalizability","fewer","population","example","conflicts","METHODS","age","years","male"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A joint investigation team of emergency response for COVID-19 epidemic by CDC professional workers of Liaocheng city and district at two levels on January 30, 2020. According to a indicator case from ZH supermarkets, close contacts and related subjects were tracked and screened on February 1, including ZH supermarket employees, family members having contact history with related cases during January 13-26, supermarket clients during January 16-30 and family members of related cases. an epidemiological investigation was carried on and their swab of nose /throat were collected and were sent to Liaocheng CDC laboratory, real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2. Results: a total of 8 437 people were screened during January 30 to February 9, 2020 (120 employees of supermarket, 93 family members, and 8224 clients of supermarket). The epidemic was caused by ZH cases and brought clustered cases in four families. A total 25 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the total infection rate of subjects was 0.30% (25/8 437) with 22 confirmed cases (0.26%, 22/8 437) and 3 asymptomatic patients (0.04%, 3/8 437), asymptomatic patients accounted for 12.00% (3/25) of all infection cases.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples is an efficient and versatile approach to detecting aquatic animals. In the ocean, eDNA composition reflects local fauna at fine spatial scales, but little is known about the effectiveness of eDNA-based monitoring of marine communities at larger scales. We investigated the potential of eDNA to characterize and distinguish marine communities at large spatial scales by comparing vertebrate species composition among marine habitats in Qatar, the Arabian Gulf (also known as the Persian Gulf), based on eDNA metabarcoding of seawater samples. We conducted species accumulation analyses to estimate how much of the vertebrate diversity we detected. We obtained eDNA sequences from a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates, spanning 191 taxa in 73 families. These included rare and endangered species and covered 36% of the bony fish genera previously recorded in the gulf. Sites of similar habitat type were also similar in eDNA composition. The species accumulation analyses showed that the number of sample replicates was insufficient for some sampling sites but suggested that a few hundred eDNA samples could potentially capture \u003E90% of the marine vertebrate diversity in the study area. Our results confirm that seawater samples contain habitat-characteristic molecular signatures and that eDNA monitoring can efficiently cover vertebrate diversity at scales relevant to national and regional conservation and management. Article impact statement: Environmental DNA provides habitat-characteristic molecular signatures and can be used efficiently to map marine biodiversity at large spatial scales.

The international cooperation involving indigenous peoples and local communities is urgently required in joint prevention to control the epidemic. Currently, many indigenous populations are continuing to face COVID 19. This study is concerned about the dynamic of COVID 19 pandemic among indigenous populations living in the remote Amazon rainforest enclaves. Using the Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model, the spread of the COVID 19 under 3 intervention scenarios (low, moderate, high) is simulated and predicted in indigenous tribe populations. The SIR model forecasts that without intervention, the epidemic peak may reach within 10 20 days. Nonetheless the peak can be reduced with strict interventions. Under low intervention, the COVID 19 cases are reduced to 73% and 56% of the total populations. While, in the scenario of high intervention, the COVID 19 peaks can be reduced to values ranging from 53% to 15% .To conclude, the simulated interventions tested by SIR model have reduced the pandemic peak and flattened the COVID 19 curve in indigenous populations.

Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI\u003E6 points or/and AIS\u003E6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins\u2014whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of infected-coronavirus cells\u2014presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature.

Multi-chains are considered as the superposition of distinctive single chains. Parameter identification is carried out by minimizing the penalty function. Results: From results of numerical simulations, the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting and reasonably interprets the revival phenomena.

Italy has now become the most hit country outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giordano, Giulia; Blanchini, Franco; Bruno, Raffaele; Colaneri, Patrizio; Filippo, Alessandro Di; Matteo, Angela Di; Colaneri, Marta; Force, the COVID19 IRCCS San Matteo Pavia Task","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e2719064be04fd488be75a358c40fc717730faf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09861v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care"],"locations":["China","Asia"],"keyphrases":["new epidemic model","non-diagnosed individuals","epidemic containment","epidemic phenomenon","SARS-CoV","COVID","Italy","infected individuals","new framework","life-threatening symptoms","emerging infectious disease outbreak","different possible predicted scenarios","deaths of people","China","total","outbreaks","seriousness","hospitalisation","order","Intensive Care Unit admission","confirmed cases","real data","novel strand of Coronavirus","misperceptions","multiple world countries","case fatality rate","effective control strategy","fatal respiratory syndrome","context","trend","potential","Hubei Province","adopted countermeasures","paramount importance","Italian Civil Protection","healthcare system capacity","Wuhan","Simulation results","patients","validity","paper","hit country","basic reproduction number","Asia","infection","pandemic","impact","distinction","ones","severity"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing. Methods: We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. Results: We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and many public gatherings were held. We further discuss three different modeled scenarios of quarantine efficiency: high-, medium-, and low-efficiency. Conclusions: Israel early lessons show that there is no allowance to compromise with the directive of social distancing. Even before the onset of the pandemic in Israel, fine-tuned but determined early decisions were taken by policy makers to monitor flight arrivals from Covid-19 affected regions and to limit public gatherings. Our analysis show that one particular holiday has shifted the occurrence curve from controlled regime to exponential growth.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed several criteria that define high-risk individuals, but multivariable prediction models may allow for a more accurate and granular risk evaluation. In the early days of the pandemic, when individual level data required for training prediction models was not available, a large healthcare organization developed a prediction model for supporting its COVID-19 policy using a hybrid strategy. The model was constructed on a baseline predictor to rank patients according to their risk for severe respiratory infection or sepsis (trained using over one-million patient records) and was then post-processed to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case fatality rates. Since its deployment in mid-March, this predictor was integrated into many decision-processes in the organization that involved allocating limited resources. With the accumulation of enough COVID-19 patients, the predictor was validated for its accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality among all COVID-19 cases in the organization (3,176, 3.1% death rate). The predictor was found to have good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.942. Calibration was also good, with a marked improvement compared to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated for the COVID-19 mortality outcome. While the CDC criteria identify 41% of the population as high-risk with a resulting sensitivity of 97%, a 5% absolute risk cutoff by the model tags only 14% to be at high-risk while still achieving a sensitivity of 90%.

Japan is known to have relatively less number of infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1,000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from March 31 to April 7, 2020, stratified by decade of age and sex. Results There were 33 positive IgG among 1,000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3-4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (poplation: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50,123 (95%CI: 34,934-69,868). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of positivity was 2.7% (95%CI 1.8-3.9%), and the estimated number of people with positive IgG was 40,999 (95%CI: 27,333-59,221). These numbers were 396 to 858 fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing in Kobe City.

For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease), however for more than 3.4% of people, it can be fatal. Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) are at risk for severe disease and mortality. The incubation period of the virus is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days but longer incubation are reported. Furthermore, Data published by world authorities shows that statistics are different for different geographical regions and depends on many social and environmental factors. The sad reality of the COVID-19 is that there are currently no medications or vaccines proven to be effective for the treatment or prevention of the disease. The pandemic spread is consequenctly followed by a worldwide panic. Facing this dramatic uncertain situation, implementing a country wide strategy for social distancing and a general logistic policy for critical and life-saving supplies is an urgency for governomental and sanitaire authorities. Several mathematical models have been proposed for developed countries to predict the epidemic spread. However these models can\u0027t be adapted to developing countries due to the major differences in geographic, societal, economic and political adopted strategies. Here, we propose the application of the well known SIR model to the case study of Tunisia where Data are collected from three official databases showing differences in reporting methods. The proposed data could be useful to predict the spread of COVID-2019 and design a more reliable model that can estimate the finale size of the spread and help in monitoring infection control.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lassoued, Abir; Ben Saad, Afef; Lassoued, Hela; Ketata, Raouf; Boubaker, Olfa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076802v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","cardiovascular disease","severe disease","Coronavirus Disease","chronic respiratory disease","symptom of respiratory disease","pandemic spread","world authorities","epidemic spread","proposed data","New confirmed infected cases","Older people","days","World Health Organization","New daily deaths","social distancing","major differences","situation report","developed countries","reliable model","sanitaire authorities","incubation period","longer incubation","mathematical models","different geographical regions","known SIR model","dramatic uncertain situation","monitoring infection control","general logistic policy","country wide strategy","life","statistics","diabetes","case study of Tunisia","pre-existing medical conditions","urgency","fever","official databases","sign","Global Level","risk","political adopted strategies","supplies","governomental","reporting methods","mild illness","crucial day","finale size","application","treatment","prevention","mortality","medications","vaccines","environmental factors","sad reality","China","marks","worldwide panic"],"language":"en"},

However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also find a 14-fold increase in the dN/dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95% C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years (95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hongru; Pipes, Lenore; Nielsen, Rasmus","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adaee6d51fb97118356056678f628497ba52541b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.052019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human SARS-CoV","synonymous divergence","amino acid divergence","human strains","recent common ancestor of SARS","recent recombination","RaTG13","recombination hypothesis","related strains","segment of high amino acid similarity","convergent amino acid evolution","RBD","GD410721","pangolin strain","pangolin isolated strain","RmYN02","years","vast majority of non-synonymous mutations","Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","bat derived viruses","dN","dS ratio","coronaviruses","strong additional support","negative impact","lineage","receptor binding domain","selection","fold increase","viral fitness","spike protein","current pandemic","average genetic distance","time","bats","detailed analysis","pattern"],"language":"en"},

An important purpose of the shutdown is to avoid overstretching intensive care unit (ICU) capacity (flattening the curve). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a successful shutdown. Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short-term. Results: A successful shutdown is projected to yield an average gain between 0.02 and 0.08 life years (0.3 to 1.0 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between 2147 and 8056 euros per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 5% to 19% of the gross domestic product in 2019. Nevertheless, if herd immunity is achieved through natural infection, even a shutdown that is successful in flattening the curve is expected to yield a loss of 0.40 life years per capita compared to the situation before the pandemic. Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population.

Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pawlowski, C.; Wagner, T.; Puranik, A.; Murugadoss, K.; Loscalzo, L.; Venkatakrishnan, A.; Pruthi, R.

NPS gather both extracellular material and human respiratory epithelial cells and, when used with RT-PCR, have reliable sensitivity for detection of viral infection. However, at our institution, we identified a 1.7% re-order rate within 7-days for NPS for respiratory pathogen RT-PCR, which we hypothesize may be due to low confidence in adequate sample collection. We sought to identify an inexpensive and accessible strategy for benchside quality assurance of NPS adequacy by observing microscopic content of viral transport media. For 801 NPS samples collected in November 2019, we air-dried and safranin-stained aliquots of viral transport media on glass slides. We then counted morphologically distinct ciliated columnar epithelial cells (CCEs). 19% of samples negative by RT-PCR for respiratory pathogens had no CCEs, while just 6% of positive samples exhibited the same. Pearson\u0027s Chi-squared test was used to compare presence of CCEs between samples that were positive and negative for respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR (p=3.3x10-38). The negative predictive value (NPV) of finding no identifiable CCEs on microscopy was 85%. We posit that samples without identifiable CCEs may have been inadequately collected. The basic, benchside protocol using inexpensive laboratory reagents that we describe here could help improve accuracy and accessibility of NPS and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV2 and other respiratory pathogens while conserving limited resources in the face of a pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matelski, Alexander T; Siddique, Nikhut I; Mead, Philip; Raimondi, Tommaso; Jorgenson, Laura C; Calderon, Omar; Harman, Kory; Farrell, John J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/159ba7c964dc99d71f35411ce8733f6160b141bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20050088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["NPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NPS samples","RT-PCR testing","respiratory pathogen RT-PCR","respiratory pathogens","accessibility of NPS","identifiable CCEs","positive samples","presence of CCEs","human respiratory epithelial cells","benchside quality assurance of NPS adequacy","SARS-CoV2","microscopic content of viral transport media","safranin-stained aliquots of viral transport media","detection of viral infection","negative predictive value","benchside protocol","collection modality","distinct ciliated columnar epithelial cells","inexpensive laboratory reagents","adequate sample collection","days","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","CDC","reliable sensitivity","extracellular material","accessible strategy","Prevention","Centers","NPV","Disease Control","glass slides","limited resources","low confidence","Pearson\u0027s Chi-squared test","re-order rate","face","accuracy","Nasopharygneal swabs","pandemic","3x10","microscopy","institution"],"language":"en"},

Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 68 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 30 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 18% to below 1:1000 in 78%, while only 3% showed titers \u003E1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) as low as few ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 without hospitalization do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robbiani, Davide F.; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C.

Data including demographics, COVID-19 severity, patient outcome, and the incidence and degree of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction were collected and analyzed. The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to quantify olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively. All subjects at one hospital (Shanghai) without subjective olfactory complaints underwent objective testing. Results: Of 394 screened subjects, 161 (41%) reported olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction and were included. Incidence of olfactory and/or gustatory disorders in Chinese (n=239), German (n=39) and French (n=116) cohorts were 32%, 69%, and 49% 138 respectively. The median age of included subjects was 39 years old, 92/161 (57%) were male, and 10/161 (6%) were children. Of included subjects, 10% had only olfactory or gustatory symptoms, and 19% had olfactory and/or gustatory complaints prior to any other COVID-19 symptom. Of subjects with objective olfactory testing, 10/90 demonstrated abnormal chemosensory function despite reporting normal subjective olfaction. 43% (44/102) of subjects with follow-up showed symptomatic improvement in olfaction or gustation.

Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the virus\u2019s evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at 8 different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by February 2nd 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 to 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1\u00D710\u22123 subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019.

In readiness for this challenge, Australia has drawn on clinical pathway models developed over many years in preparation for influenza pandemics. These models have been used to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients, in the context of broader public health measures. Methods An age and risk stratified transmission model of COVID-19 infection was used to simulate an unmitigated epidemic with parameter ranges reflecting uncertainty in current estimates of transmissibility and severity. Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing. Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways. Findings An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone will be insufficient to constrain case presentations within a feasible level of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions will need to be applied at some level over the course of the epidemic to ensure that systems do not become overwhelmed, and that essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed to ensure access to critical care. Interpretation Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality will rely on a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health and clinical capacity, along with reduction of overall infection transmission in the community. Ongoing attention to maintaining and strengthening the capacity of health care systems and workers to manage cases is needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moss, Robert; Wood, James; Brown, Damien; Shearer, Freya; Black, Andrew J; Cheng, Allen; McCaw, James M; McVernon, Jodie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12133f479d0ee1c9d0ac85f0ef94bbe31eca0d09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056184","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["care of COVID","capacity of health care systems","health care requirements","health sector capacity","Australian health care system","clinical capacity","Australian health system","pathway of clinical care","Overlaid public health measures","critical care","unmitigated COVID","ability of global health systems","context of broader public health measures","essential health sector functions","Clinical presentations","expansion of available intensive care capacity","clinical pathway models","increasing numbers of COVID","case isolation","case presentations","unmitigated epidemic","risk stratified transmission model of COVID","alternative clinical assessment pathways","cases","combination of measures","patients","feasible level of expansion","Overlaid social restrictions","reduction of overall infection transmission","quarantine of contacts","contact quarantine","social distancing","Ongoing attention","reflecting uncertainty","patient flows","parameter","years","current estimates of transmissibility","age","workers","preparation","Methods","access","prolonged period","influenza pandemics","severity","community","challenge","mortality","morbidity","Findings","major concern","readiness","Interpretation","course"],"language":"en"},

The population of Mexico is younger, yet the impact of COVID-19 on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging. METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for improving COVID-19 mortality risk prediction. RESULTS: We analyzed 7,029 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged [\u2265]60 years. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a comprehensive geriatric care approach.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bello-Chavolla, O.

The main protease (Mpro) in SARS-CoV-2 is a viable drug target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the virus polypeptide and subsequent viral replication. Feline infectious peritonitis, a fatal infection in cats caused by a coronavirus, was successfully treated previously with a dipeptide-based protease inhibitor. Here we show this drug, GC376, and its analog GC373, are effective inhibitors of the Mpro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these inhibitors have a covalent modification of the nucleophilic Cys145. NMR analysis reveals that inhibition proceeds via reversible formation of a hemithioacetal. GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, with EC50 values near one micromolar and little to no toxicity. These protease inhibitors are soluble, non-toxic, and bind reversibly. They are strong drug candidates for the treatment of human coronavirus infections because they have already been successful in animals (cats).

IBV-associated tracheitis, nephritis, salpingitis, proventriculitis and egg drop have caused devastating economic losses to poultry industry worldwide. Since the end of 2018, a remarkably increasing number of commercial broilers and layers, vaccinated or not, were infected with IBV in China. Here, we described two IB outbreaks with severe respiratory system or kidney injury in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms in central China. Other possible causative viral pathogens, including Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Kedah fatal kidney syndrome virus (KFKSV), were excluded by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and three virulent IBV strains, HeN-1/China/2019, HeN-2/China/2019 and HeN-101/China/2019, were identified. Although the gross pathologic appearance of these two IB outbreaks were different, the newly identified IBV strains were all closely related to the ck/China/I0529/17 strain and grouped into GI-19 genotype clade based on the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 genes. Moreover, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains, HeN-101/China/2019 in particular, and other GI-19 strains, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve toward different directions. In conclusion, this study provided an insight of the recently emerging IBV outbreaks in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms and identified the genetic characteristics of three virulent GI-19 IBV strains, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaozhan; Deng, Tongwei; Lu, Jianzhou; Zhao, Pandeng; Chen, Lulu; Qian, Mengwei; Guo, Yiwen; Qiao, Hongxing; Xu, Yaohui; Wang, Yan; Li, Xinzheng; Zhang, Guizhi; Wang, Zeng; Bian, Chuanzhou","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31943814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IB"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["identified IBV strains","virulent IBV strains","Chinese IBV strains","emerging IBV outbreaks","IBV-associated tracheitis","HeN","central China","commercial poultry farms","IB outbreaks","virulent GI","Avian influenza virus","Newcastle disease virus","Infectious bronchitis virus","Kedah fatal kidney syndrome virus","ongoing emergence enveloped virus","poultry industry","number of commercial broilers","kidney injury","different directions","NDV","egg drop","severe respiratory system","devastating economic losses","salpingitis","proventriculitis","nephritis","KFKSV","AIV","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","phylogenetic analysis","RT-PCR","genetic characteristics","possible causative viral pathogens","sequencing","proper preventive measures","insight","need","positive-sense RNA genome","Gammacoronavirus genus","complete S1 genes","control strategies","gross pathologic appearance","genotype clade","evolutionary distance","Coronaviridae family","layers","I0529","conclusion","study","ck","end"],"language":"en"},

By mid-March, all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City (NYC), and four U.S. territories had reported cases of COVID-19. This report describes the geographic distribution of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths reported by each U.S. state, each territory and freely associated state,* DC, and NYC during February 12-April 7, 2020, and estimates cumulative incidence for each jurisdiction. In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7). As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC. On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases. Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC. Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices. Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"MMWR.

AIMS To assess the efficiency of AndraStent XXL before PPVI. METHODS In this retrospective multicentre cohort study, 86 AndraStents XXL were implanted in 77 patients in 6 centres. RESULTS PPVI was indicated mainly for pulmonary regurgitation (75.3%) in native or patched RVOT (88.3%). The stents were manually mounted on balloon catheters and delivered through sheaths using a conventional femoral approach. PPVI was performed successfully in 97.4% of patients after successful prestenting, generally during the same procedure (77.9%). There were no deaths associated with stent implantation, and four patients experienced five complications, mainly stent embolization, including one requiring surgery.

It is unclear whether telephone-based services for people affected by chronic disease are a practical setting for implementing distress screening, referral protocols and rescreening to direct supportive care where it is needed. This systematic review aimed to describe the published literature regarding distress screening and supportive care referral practices in telephone-based services for people affected by chronic diseases such as cancer. METHODS A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane and Scopus was conducted in February 2018. Included quantitative studies involved: patients or caregivers affected by chronic diseases including cancer and describe a health service assessing psychosocial needs or distress via telephone. Extracted data included the type of cancer or other chronic disease, sample size, screening tool, referral or rescreening protocols, and type of health service. RESULTS The search identified 3989 potential articles with additional searches returning 30 studies (n = 4019); fourteen were eligible for full-text review. Of the 14 studies, 13 included cancer patients. Studies were across multiple settings and identified nine distress screening tools in use. CONCLUSION The reviewed studies indicate that validated distress-screening tools are being used via telephone to identify distress, particularly in relation to cancer. Screening-driven supportive care referrals are also taking place in telephone-based services. However, not all services use an established referral protocol. Ongoing rescreening of callers\u0027 distress is also limited despite it being an important recommendation from psycho-oncology guidelines.","publish_time":"2019-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Jo; Fradgley, Elizabeth A; Clinton-McHarg, Tara; Roach, Della; Paul, Chris L","journal":"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-019-05252-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31872298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Scopus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distress screening tools","validated distress-screening tools","chronic diseases","telephone-based services","type of cancer","included cancer patients","high levels of distress","Ongoing rescreening of callers\u0027 distress","referral protocols","reviewed studies","quantitative studies","supportive care referral practices","rescreening protocols","supportive care referrals","direct supportive care","established referral protocol","type of health service","PURPOSE People","systematic review","use","systematic literature search of MEDLINE","published literature","psychosocial needs","psychosocial support","text review","Embase","sample size","PsycInfo","place","caregivers","additional searches","practical setting","CINAHL","potential articles","multiple settings","important recommendation","psycho-oncology guidelines","Cochrane","METHODS","Scopus","CONCLUSION","data","relation"],"language":"en"},

The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

Robotic surgery is considered more expensive than open or laparoscopic approaches, but in certain situations has been demonstrated to be cost-effective. We examined the cost-effectiveness of open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches to proctectomy from societal and healthcare system perspectives. METHODS We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate one-year costs and outcomes of robotic, laparoscopic, and open proctectomy based on data from the available literature. The robustness of our results was tested with one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Open proctectomy had increased cost and lower quality of life (QOL) compared with laparoscopy and robotic approaches. In the societal perspective, robotic proctectomy costs $497/case more than laparoscopy, with minimal QOL improvements, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $751,056 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the healthcare sector perspective, robotic proctectomy resulted in $983/case more and an ICER of $1,485,139/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated factors influencing cost-effectiveness primarily pertained to the operative cost and the postoperative length of stay (LOS). In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost-effective approach to proctectomy was laparoscopic in 42% of cases, robotic in 39%, and open in 19% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic and robotic proctectomy cost less and have higher QALY than the open approach. Based on current data, laparoscopy is the most cost-effective approach. Robotic proctectomy can be cost-effective if modest differences in costs or postoperative LOS can be achieved.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simianu, Vlad V; Curran, Thomas; Gaertner, Wolfgang B; Sklow, Bradford; Kuntz, Karen M; Kwaan, Mary R; Madoff, Robert D; Jensen, Christine C","journal":"Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-020-04615-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["robotic proctectomy costs","robotic approaches","RESULTS Open proctectomy","outcomes of robotic","cost-effectiveness of open","open approach","BACKGROUND Robotic surgery","laparoscopic approaches","cost-effective approach","CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic","laparoscopy","year costs","higher QALY","One-way sensitivity analyses","operative cost","societal perspective","postoperative LOS","incremental cost-effectiveness ratio","ICER","quality-adjusted life year","multi-way sensitivity analyses","lower quality of life","probabilistic sensitivity analysis","healthcare sector perspective","current data","postoperative length of stay","minimal QOL improvements","healthcare system perspectives","modest differences","factors","decision-analytic model","certain situations","available literature","METHODS","WTP","willingness","cases","robustness"],"language":"en"},

CONCLUSIONS We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions.

METHODS A total of 1,950 cancer patients finished questionnaires in four provinces in southern China. The survey included socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants, dosage forms, efficacy, and side effects. RESULTS The study results showed that cancer patients with higher education (\u003E12 years) were more likely to accept the treatment of Chinese herbs. There were 54.61% (1,065 cases) of patients chose Chinese herbs for the initial treatment and 14.46% (282 cases) chose Chinese herbs as monotherapy. Most patients (54.51%, 1,063 cases) continuously used CM for more than 6 months, and a few of them (212 cases) used CM for up to 3 years. All kinds of dosage forms of CM had been used, including CM decoction, CM patent prescription and CM injection. Concerning the efficacy in the view of patients, 40.31% (786 cases) believed that it would be effective to take Chinese herbs before they starting the anti-cancer treatment, and the percentage increased to 81.08% after 1-month CM treatment. The effect of Chinese herbs was mainly demonstrated by symptom relief and improvement of quality of life, and 8.31% (162 cases) of patients experienced control of tumor growth and decreased tumor markers. Furthermore, only 14.31% (279 cases) participants reported that they experienced side effects during CM treatment.

There is no effective vaccine or approved drug treatment against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. The development of antiviral agents is an urgent priority. Biochemical events critical to the coronavirus replication cycle provided a number of attractive targets for drug development. These include, spike protein for binding to host cell surface receptor, proteolytic enzymes that are essential for processing polyproteins into mature viruses, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase for RNA replication. There has been much ground work for drug discovery and development against these targets. Also, high throughput screening efforts led to identification of diverse lead structures, including product-derived molecules. The present review highlights past and present drug discovery and medicinal chemistry approaches against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19 targets. The review will stimulate further research and will be a useful guide to the development of effective therapy against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Arun K; Brindisi, Margherita; Shahabi, Dana; Chapman, Mackenzie E; Mesecar, Andrew D","journal":"ChemMedChem","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202000223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug development","COVID","present drug discovery","RNA replication","SARS-CoV","development of effective therapy","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","approved drug treatment","MERS-CoV","development of antiviral agents","pathogenic coronaviruses","present review highlights","number of attractive targets","effective vaccine","coronavirus replication cycle","host cell surface receptor","proteolytic enzymes","mature viruses","medicinal chemistry approaches","identification of diverse lead structures","binding","processing polyproteins","high throughput screening efforts","Biochemical events critical","spike protein","useful guide","unprecedented health emergency","product-derived molecules","infection","ground work","alarming rate","urgent priority","globe","research","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE The objective of the present study was to detect T. gondii DNA from internal bat organs from Quind\u00EDo, Colombia. RESULTS We report the first detection of T. gondii DNA from internal bat organs in the department of Quindio, Central Andes of Colombia. Out of three silky short tail bat (Carollia brevicauda) specimens collected at the natural reserve \u0022La Monta\u00F1a del Ocaso\u0022, organs were recovered (lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, small and large intestine) and tested for T. gondii through PCR for B1 sequence, with 1/3 (33.3%) positive result for the presence of T. gondii DNA in bat kidney tissues.

However, the exact incidence of venous thromboembolic event is unknown in anticoagulated severe COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES Systematic assessment of VTE using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in anticoagulated COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study in 2 French intensive care units (ICU) were CDU is performed as a standard of care. A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. Anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis. Patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation. Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration. RESULTS From March 19th to April 11th of 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE. 8 patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69%. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared to the other group (100% vs. 56%, respectively, p=0.03). Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms.

The purpose of our study was to explore the current evidence on barriers and enablers for the implementation of humanoid robots in health and social care. DESIGN Systematic review of studies entailing hands-on interactions with a humanoid robot. SETTING From April 2018 to June 2018, databases were searched using a combination of the same search terms for articles published during the last decade. Data collection was conducted by using the Rayyan software, a standardised predefined grid, and a risk of bias and a quality assessment tool. PARTICIPANTS Post-experimental data were collected and analysed for a total of 420 participants. Participants comprised: older adults (n=307) aged \u226560 years, with no or some degree of age-related cognitive impairment, residing either in residential care facilities or at their home; care home staff (n=106); and informal caregivers (n=7). PRIMARY OUTCOMES Identification of enablers and barriers to the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots in health and social care, and consequent insights and impact. Future developments to inform further research. RESULTS Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. None of the selected studies had an experimental design; hence overall quality was low, with high risks of biases. Several studies had no comparator, no baseline, small samples, and self-reported measures only. Within this limited evidence base, the enablers found were enjoyment, usability, personalisation and familiarisation. Barriers were related to technical problems, to the robots\u0027 limited capabilities and the negative preconceptions towards the use of robots in healthcare. Factors which produced mixed results were the robot\u0027s human-like attributes, previous experience with technology and views of formal and informal carers. CONCLUSIONS The available evidence related to implementation factors of socially assistive humanoid robots for older adults is limited, mainly focusing on aspects at individual level, and exploring acceptance of this technology.

There are very limited data on the interference of immunomodulating drugs on the risk of infection and on the course of the disease. In particular, there are no current clinical data about the interference exerted by dupilumab, a biologic drugs blocking IL-4 and IL-13, used for adult atopic dermatitis (AD). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is complex, characterized by an immune response mainly Th1/Th17. The hyper-activation of these cells may cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines that may result in lung impairment. IL-4 and IL-13 are Th2 cytokines, thus being part of a pathway not considered implicated in host defense mechanism against viral infections. Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials. Furthermore, dupilumab has been proven to be efficacious also in exacerbations of asthma, and it is known that viral infections can worsen asthma. Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic. Obviously, a careful assessment is mandatory for each individual patient and further studies are necessary to characterize the immunologic responses in COVID-19.

However, it is a heterogeneous condition with inter-related factors including ethnicity, body mass index and gestational weight gain significantly modifying the absolute risk of complications at an individual level. Predicting the risk of pregnancy complications for an individual woman with GDM presents a useful adjunct to therapeutic decision-making and patient education. Diagnostic prediction models for GDM are prevalent. In contrast, prediction models for risk of complications in those with GDM are relatively novel. This study will systematically review published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM, describe their characteristics, compare performance and assess methodological quality and applicability. METHODS Studies will be identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. The included studies will be systematically assessed for risk of bias and applicability using appropriate tools designed for prediction modelling studies. Extracted data will be tabulated to facilitate qualitative comparison of published prediction models. Quantitative data on predictive performance of these models will be synthesised with meta-analyses if appropriate. DISCUSSION This review will identify and summarise all published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM. We will compare model performance across different settings and populations with meta-analysis if appropriate. This work will guide subsequent phases in the prognosis research framework: further model development, external validation and model updating, and impact assessment. The ultimate model will estimate the absolute risk of pregnancy complications for women with GDM and will be implemented into routine care as an evidence-based GDM complication risk prediction model. It is anticipated to offer value to women and their clinicians with individualised risk assessment and may assist decision-making. Ultimately, this systematic review is an important step towards a personalised risk-stratified model-of-care for GDM to allow preventative and therapeutic interventions for the maximal benefit to women and their offspring, whilst sparing expense and harm for those at low risk.

In particular, in the context of a pre-existing \u0022hub-and-spoke\u0022 network, we describe how procedure types and volumes have changed in the last 3 months. RESULTS Since our institution was selected as a COVID-19 referral center, the entire in-hospital activity was reorganized to assist more than 1000 COVID-positive cases. Only urgent EP procedures, including ventricular tachycardia ablation and extraction of infected devices, were both maintained and optimized to meet the needs of external hospitals. In addition, most of the non-urgent EP procedures were postponed. Finally, following prompt internal reorganization, both outpatient clinics and on-call services underwent significant modification, by integrating telemedicine support whenever applicable. CONCLUSION We presented the fast reorganization of an EP referral center during the ongoing COVID-19 healthcare emergency.

Various Solidago-canadensis-L.-derived biochars prepared through pyrolysis from 400 to 600 \u00B0C were applied to coastal saline-alkali soil samples to optimise the biochar pyrolysis temperature and investigate its actual ecological responses. All biochars reduced the soil bulk density and exchangeable sodium stress and increased soil water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter content. Principal-component-analysis results showed that pyrolysis temperature played an important role in the potential application of biochars to improve the coastal saline-alkali soil, mainly contributed to ameliorating exchangeable sodium stress and decreasing biochar-soluble toxic compounds. Furthermore, soil bulk density and organic matter, as well as carboxylic acids, phenolic acids and amines of biochar were major driving factors for bacterial community composition. Compared to low-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed below 550 \u00B0C), which showed higher toxicity for Brassica chinensis L. growth due to the higher content of carboxylic acids, phenols and amines, high-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed at or above 550 \u00B0C) possessed less amounts of these toxic functional groups, more beneficial soil bacteria and healthier for plant growth. Therefore, high-temperature biochar could be applied as an effective soil amendment to ameliorate the coastal saline-alkali soil with acceptable environmental risk.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Jiawen; Zhang, Shudong; Zhang, Xiaotong; Chen, Jinhuan; He, Xinyu; Zhang, Qiuzhuo","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brassica"],"keyphrases":["biochar pyrolysis temperature","saline-alkali soil amendments","coastal saline-alkali soil samples","soil bulk density","high-temperature biochar","amines of biochar","low-temperature biochar","increased soil water","beneficial soil bacteria","effective soil amendment","biochar-soluble toxic compounds","derived biochars","potential application of biochars","higher content of carboxylic acids","exchangeable sodium stress","phenolic acids","organic matter content","salinity of coastal soils","higher toxicity","plant growth","cation exchange capacity","toxic functional groups","major driving factors","phenols","bacterial community composition","important role","analysis results","acceptable environmental risk","Brassica chinensis","amounts","actual ecological responses","considerable attention","Principal-component","Various Solidago-canadensis"],"language":"en"},

Common clinically focussed tools may be less appropriate. OBJECTIVE To identify stakeholder perceptions of key outcomes from supplementary palliative care support services, then map these onto outcome measurement tools to assess relevance and item redundancy. METHODS A scoping review using Arksey and O\u0027Malley\u0027s design. EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE and PSYCHinfo searched using terms relating to palliative care, qualitative research and supplementary support interventions. Papers imported into Endnote\u2122, and Covidence\u2122 used by two reviewers to assess against inclusion criteria. Included papers were imported into NVivo\u2122, and thematically coded to identify key concepts underpinning outcomes. Each item within contender outcome measurement tools was assessed against each concept. RESULTS 60 included papers focused on advance care planning, guided conversations, and volunteer befriending services. Four concepts were identified: enriching relationships; greater autonomy and perceived control; knowing more; and improved mental health. Mapping concepts to contender tool items revealed issues of relevance and redundancy. Some tools had no redundant items, but mapped only to two of four outcome themes, others mapped to all concepts, but with many redundant questions.

An educational program was then completed that involved training our anesthesia providers about complications related to excessive cuff pressure and how to utilize a quantitative cuff pressure measurement device (manometer). The impact of this educational initiative was assessed by comparing the incidence of postoperative complications associated with the use of airway devices before and after the training period. METHODS After approval by our institution\u0027s Institutional Review Board, a pre-intervention (baseline) survey was obtained from 259 adult patients after having undergone surgery with general anesthesia with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Survey responses were used to determine the baseline incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Once these results were obtained, education was provided to the anesthesia department members addressing the complications associated with excessive cuff pressures, appropriate cuff pressures based on manufacturer recommendations, and instructions on the use of a quantitative monitor to determine cuff pressure (manometry). Clinical care was then changed by requiring intraoperative cuff pressure monitoring throughout our institution for all surgical patients. After this educational period, 299 patients completed the same survey describing postoperative airway complications. RESULTS The use of manometry reduced the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative sore throat in the pre- vs. post-intervention groups (35 patients vs 31 patients, p = 0.045), moderate to severe hoarseness (30 patients vs 13, patients p = 0.0001), and moderate-to-severe dysphagia (13 patients vs 5 patients, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Caring for patients in the perioperative setting frequently entails placement of an airway device. This procedure is associated with several potential complications, including sore throat, coughing, and vocal cord damage. Our quality improvement initiative has shown that intraoperative management of intra-cuff pressure based on manometry is feasible to implement in clinical practice and can reduce postoperative airway complications.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fritz, Ashley V; Mickus, Gregory J; Vega, Michael A; Renew, J Ross; Brull, Sorin J","journal":"BMC anesthesiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-00963-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32093637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institutional Review Board"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients vs","patients p","postoperative airway complications","adult patients","surgical patients","incidence of postoperative complications","use of airway devices","potential complications","use of manometry","intraoperative cuff pressure monitoring","excessive cuff pressures","severe postoperative sore throat","use of cuffed airway devices","incidence of moderate","quantitative cuff pressure measurement device","appropriate cuff pressures","intraoperative management of intra-cuff pressure","baseline incidence of sore throat","laryngeal mask airway","severe hoarseness","severe dysphagia","educational initiative","educational period","pre-intervention","general anesthesia","anesthesia providers","quality improvement initiative","Survey responses","training period","educational program","results","anesthesia department members","quantitative monitor","clinical practice","Clinical care","post-intervention groups","institution\u0027s Institutional Review Board","manufacturer recommendations","undergone surgery","approval","project","endotracheal tube","manometer","QI","instructions","placement","perioperative setting","single center","METHODS","vocal cord damage","BACKGROUND","LMA","impact","procedure","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This study assesses the relationship between visible fractures on the top and bottom of core samples and the resulting hydraulic and mass transport properties of the core. We hypothesized that more visible fractures would indicate the presence of a well-connected fracture network, leading to greater hydraulic conductivity (K) values and earlier chemical breakthrough times. To test this hypothesis, water flow and bromide (Br-) tracer experiments were performed on ten, 16-cm diameter, 16-cm-tall samples of fractured Dows Formation till from central Iowa. Visually identifiable fractures were present on the top and bottom of every sample. Results indicate that the visual identification of fractures does not predict a connected fracture network, as some samples produced breakthrough curves showing rapid first arrival times and shapes characteristic of solute transport in a fractured medium, while others appeared similar to an unfractured medium. No correlation was found between the number of visible fractures and K (Pearson\u0027s r = 0.25), or Br- first arrival time (r = -0.33), but a strong negative correlation between K and first arrival time (r = -0.92). Results indicate that the sample volume was not large enough to reliably contain a connected fracture network. Thus, testing large volumes of till at the field scale coupled with fracture-flow modeling likely represents the best approach for estimating hydraulic and mass transport properties for fractured till.

To achieve proper motor control in diverse situations, predicting future states of the environment and body and modifying the prediction are indispensable. The internal model is a promising hypothesis about brain function for generating and modifying the prediction. Although several findings support the involvement of the cerebellum in the internal model, recent results support the influence of other related brain regions on the internal model. A representative example is the motor adaptation ability in Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) patients. Although this ability provides some hints about how dopamine deficits and other PD symptoms affect the internal model, previous findings are inconsistent; some reported a deficit in the motor adaptation ability in PD patients, but others reported that the motor adaptation ability of PD patients is comparable to that of healthy controls. A possible factor causing this inconsistency is the difference in task settings, resulting in different cognitive strategies in each study. Here, we demonstrate a larger, but not better, motor adaptation ability in PD patients than in healthy controls while reducing the involvement of cognitive strategies and concentrating on implicit motor adaptation abilities. This study utilizes a smart-device-based experiment that enables motor adaptation experiments anytime and anywhere with less cognitive strategy involvement. The PD patients showed a significant response to insensible environmental changes, but the response was not necessarily suitable for adapting to the changes. Our findings support compensatory cerebellar functions in PD patients from the perspective of motor adaptation.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takiyama, Ken; Sakurada, Takeshi; Shinya, Masahiro; Sato, Takaaki; Ogihara, Hirofumi; Komatsu, Taiki","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63717-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["motor adaptation ability of PD patients","motor adaptation experiments","perspective of motor adaptation","implicit motor adaptation abilities","PD symptoms","internal model","proper motor control","appropriate motor commands","involvement of cognitive strategies","cognitive strategy involvement","essential brain function","different cognitive strategies","previous findings","healthy controls","study","prediction","related brain regions","significant response","insensible environmental changes","diverse situations","influence","based experiment","future states","Parkinson\u0027s disease","task settings","compensatory cerebellar functions","inconsistency","body","recent results","promising hypothesis","cerebellum","smart-device","dopamine deficits","difference","representative example","hints","possible factor"],"language":"en"},

The pathogenesis leading to rapid deterioration is unknown.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vallejo, Victoria; Ilagan, John G","journal":"Obstetrics and gynecology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Limited U.S."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pregnant patient","COVID","infection","critical cases","year-old patient","rapid onset of critical complications","hours of admission","rapid deterioration","reports of pregnant women","aggressive supportive care","intensive care unit","fever","cough","cardiopulmonary arrest","transfer","coronavirus disease","shortness of breath","cesarean delivery","weeks of gestation","sore throat","intubation","sepsis","investigational therapies","BACKGROUND Limited","multiorgan failure","respiratory distress","pathogenesis","maternal mortality"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Cohort of hospitalized patients with TIA and stroke discharged alive from a large university hospital in Norway, and their informal caregivers. Questionnaires at 3 and 12 months post discharge were filled out by caregivers (n = 320 and n = 326, respectively) and survivors (n = 368 and n = 383, respectively). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested associations between initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) in caregivers and survivors. RESULTS Caregivers of survivors with TIA or stroke did not report lower HRQoL than matched norms. There was some evidence of an association of the NIHSS with caregiver HRQoL at 3 months only (age-sex-adjusted coefficient - 0.01, p = 0.008), however, this was attenuated after additional adjustments. Survivors with stroke, but not TIA, reported lower HRQoL than population norms at both time points. There was a negative association between higher NIHSS scores and survivors\u0027 HRQoL; fully adjusted coefficient - 0.01 at both time points (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION The informal caregivers and survivors with TIA did not report lower than expected HRQoL. Increasing stroke severity was associated with decreasing HRQoL among survivors, but had limited predictive value among caregivers. Other factors may therefore be better indicators of \u0027at risk\u0027 caregivers.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Labberton, Angela S; Augestad, Liv Ariane; Thommessen, Bente; Barra, Mathias","journal":"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02516-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TIA","National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["subsequent HRQoL of caregivers","lower HRQoL","RESULTS Caregivers of survivors","informal caregivers","survivors\u0027 HRQoL","caregiver HRQoL","decreasing HRQoL","expected HRQoL","association of initial stroke severity","stroke-specific scale","National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale","survivors of transient ischaemic attack","matched norms","sex-matched population norms","age-sex","adjusted coefficient","negative association","months post discharge","time points","higher NIHSS scores","year post discharge","health-related quality of life","associations","Multivariable linear regression analyses","large university hospital","Norway","comparison","METHODS Cohort of hospitalized patients","better indicators","risk","predictive value","CONCLUSION","factors","PURPOSE","Questionnaires","evidence","additional adjustments"],"language":"en"},

Large cohort studies can provide further understanding into inter-individual differences, with more precise characterization of the pathways by which the gut microbiota influences human physiology and disease processes. Here, we aimed to profile the stool microbiome of children and adults from two population-based cohort studies, comprising 2,111 children in the age-range of 9 to 12 years (the Generation R Study) and 1,427 adult individuals in the range of 46 to 88 years of age (the Rotterdam Study). For the two cohorts, 16S rRNA gene profile datasets derived from the Dutch population were generated. The comparison of the two cohorts showed that children had significantly lower gut microbiome diversity. Furthermore, we observed higher relative abundances of genus Bacteroides in children and higher relative abundances of genus Blautia in adults. Predicted functional metagenome analysis showed an overrepresentation of the glycan degradation pathways, riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis pathways in children. In contrast, the gut microbiome of adults showed higher abundances of carbohydrate metabolism pathways, beta-lactam resistance, thiamine (vitamin B1) and pantothenic (vitamin B5) biosynthesis pathways. A predominance of catabolic pathways in children (valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation) as compared to biosynthetic pathways in adults (valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis) suggests a functional microbiome switch to the latter in adult individuals. Overall, we identified compositional and functional differences in gut microbiome between children and adults in a population-based setting. These microbiome profiles can serve as reference for future studies on specific human disease susceptibility in childhood, adulthood and specific diseased populations.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radjabzadeh, Djawad; Boer, Cindy G; Beth, Sanne A; van der Wal, Pelle; Kiefte-De Jong, Jessica C; Jansen, Michelle A E; Konstantinov, Sergey R; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P; Hays, John P; Jaddoe, Vincent W V; Ikram, M Arfan; Rivadeneira, Fernando; van Meurs, Joyce B J; Uitterlinden, Andr\u00E9 G; Medina-Gomez, Carolina; Moll, Henriette A; Kraaij, Robert","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57734-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31974429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Generation R Study"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut microbiome of adults","biosynthesis pathways","stool microbiome of children","biosynthetic pathways","gut microbiota","microbiome profiles","glycan degradation pathways","functional microbiome switch","lower gut microbiome diversity","vitamin B1","vitamin B2","vitamin B6","vitamin B9","vitamin B5","higher abundances of carbohydrate metabolism pathways","predominance of catabolic pathways","isoleucine biosynthesis","functional differences","population-based cohort studies","specific human disease susceptibility","higher relative abundances of genus Bacteroides","higher relative abundances of genus Blautia","human health","valine","human physiology","disease processes","isoleucine degradation","future studies","Dutch population","population-based setting","Large cohort studies","cohorts","adult individuals","years of age","age-range","functional metagenome analysis","Rotterdam Study","specific diseased populations","Generation R Study","inter-individual differences","S rRNA gene profile datasets","childhood","beta-lactam resistance","adulthood","folate","thiamine","pyridoxine","overrepresentation","riboflavin","reference","precise characterization","diverse roles","underlying mechanisms","contrast","comparison"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this systematic review was to determine if physical fitness qualities were associated with performance of sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players. METHODS Five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, ProQuest, and Scopus) were searched for relevant studies up to April 15, 2019. Full-text articles investigating relationships between physical fitness and sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players were included. Methodological quality of included studies was appraised using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Data synthesis was conducted to determine the summary of evidence based on the number of significantly associated relationships divided by the total relationships assessed. An individual relationship was defined as a reported result examining the association between a single physical fitness variable and a single sport-specific technical skill. RESULTS Data synthesis of grouped female ball players from 41 included studies revealed three clear associations: (i) body composition and defensive technical skills (19/29; 66%), (ii) agility and movement with a ball (4/6; 67%), and (iii) coordination and movement with a ball (3/5; 60%). An uncertain association exists between cardiorespiratory fitness and defensive technical skills (2/5; 40%). No association or an unknown conclusion (\u003C 5 relationships reported) exists between all remaining physical fitness attributes and sport-specific technical skills. Sub-analyses revealed clear associations between body composition and throwing/shooting (using hands) in junior ball players (15/15; 100%) and with movement with a ball in elite (6/9; 67%) and senior (6/6; 100%) ball players. Three uncertain associations were found between offensive technical skills and agility in elite ball players (3/8; 38%), and with speed in elite (6/14; 43%) and junior (7/18; 39%) female ball players. CONCLUSION There is limited evidence available to demonstrate relationships between physical fitness qualities and sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players.

Two phantoms were used to assess the possible application of scatter imaging for markerless tracking of lung tumors during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment. A scatter-imaging camera was assembled with a CsI flat-panel detector and a 5 mm diameter pinhole collimator. Scatter images were collected during the irradiation of phantoms with megavoltage photons. To assess scatter image quality, spherical phantom lung tumors of 2.1 - 2.8 cm diameters were placed inside a static, anthropomorphic phantom. To show the efficacy of the technique with a moving target (3 cm diameter), the position of a simulated tumor was tracked in scatter images during sinusoidal motion (15 mm amplitude, 0.25 Hz frequency) in a dynamic lung phantom in open-field, dynamic conformal arc (DCA), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries. Anatomical features are identifiable on static phantom scatter images collected with 10 MU of delivered dose (2.1 cm diameter lung tumor contrast-to-noise ratio of 4.4). The contrast-to-noise ratio increases with tumor size and delivered dose. During dynamic motion, the position of the 3.0 cm diameter lung tumor was identified with a root-mean-square error of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.9 mm for open field (0.3 s frame integration), DCA (0.5 s), and VMAT (0.5 s), respectively. Based on phantom studies, scatter imaging is a potential technique for markerless lung tumor tracking during SBRT without additional imaging dose. Quality scatter images may be collected at low, clinically relevant doses (10 MU). Scatter images are capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision, but modulation decreases accuracy.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Kevin C; Turian, Julius V; Redler, Gage; Cifter, Gizem; Strologas, John; Templeton, Alistair; Bernard, Damian; Chu, James C H","journal":"Physics in medicine and biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab9355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408276/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Quality scatter images","static phantom scatter images","scatter-imaging camera","dynamic lung phantom","markerless lung tumor","scatter image quality","diameter lung tumor contrast","possible application of scatter imaging","spherical phantom lung tumors","markerless tracking of lung tumors","phantom studies","tumor size","simulated tumor","additional imaging dose","anthropomorphic phantom","dynamic motion","open-field","open field","DCA","SBRT","therapy beam","dynamic conformal arc","noise ratio","VMAT","position","diameter pinhole collimator","volumetric modulated arc therapy","s frame integration","stereotactic body radiation therapy","potential technique","sinusoidal motion","irradiation of phantoms","megavoltage photons","capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision","modulation","CsI flat-panel detector","Anatomical features","Hz frequency","amplitude","treatment","deliveries","root","moving target","treated volume","relevant doses","accuracy","square error","efficacy","diameters"],"language":"en"},

Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have been shown to have increased vulnerability and risk to disasters due to links between racism, vulnerability, and economic power, based on disadvantage related to different disaster stages: 1) reduced perception of personal disaster risk; 2) lack of preparedness; 3) reduced access and response to warning systems; 4) increased physical impacts due to substandard housing; 5) likelihood of poorer psychological outcomes; 6) cultural insensitivity on the part of emergency workers; 7) marginalization, lower socio-economic status, and less familiarity with support resources leading to protracted recovery; and 8) diminished standard of living, job loss, and exacerbated poverty during reconstruction and community rebuilding. Moreover, given that psychiatric morbidity is predictable in populations exposed to disasters, mental health and psychosocial support programs should increasingly become a standard part of a humanitarian response. In the crisis and immediate recovery phase of disasters, the focus should be on making survivors feel safe and giving them assistance in decreasing their anxiety by addressing their basic needs and welfare. So, it is critical that governmental institutions, business, and non-profit organizations proactively find mechanisms to work collaboratively and share resources. Special attention and extra resources must be directed towards vulnerable and marginalized populations. In this editorial we share lessons learned from experiencing disproportionate impact of health crisis and advocate for the notion that recovery efforts must address trauma at individual, interpersonal and community levels, and be based in a healing justice framework.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shervington, Denese O; Richardson, Lisa","journal":"Journal of injury \u0026 violence research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5249/jivr.v12i2.1538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["perception of personal disaster risk","support resources","increased vulnerability","United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction","different disaster stages","likelihood of loss","recovery efforts","protracted recovery","immediate recovery phase of disasters","extra resources","job loss","mental health","disproportionate impact of health crisis","United States","community rebuilding","community levels","marginalized populations","given period","humanitarian response","psychosocial support programs","diminished standard of living","likelihood of poorer psychological outcomes","advocate","exacerbated poverty","individual","familiarity","trauma","notion","business","marginalization","cultural insensitivity","conditions of exposure","disadvantage","reconstruction","life","injury","racism","damage","destruction","lower socio-economic status","governmental institutions","non-profit organizations","substandard housing","physical impacts","emergency workers","complex interactions","systems","product","ethnic minorities","economic power","focus","links","lack of preparedness","basic needs","assistance","anxiety","survivors","lessons","access","psychiatric morbidity","Special attention","mechanisms","hazard","healing justice framework","welfare","editorial"],"language":"en"},

Radical cystectomy is the standard treatment. However, due to surgery and postoperative complications, the quality of life of patients is seriously affected. Therefore, it is increasingly important to find prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for MIBC. Here, we investigated the expression of PDK1, a key regulator of glucose metabolism, in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and its effect on prognosis. The expression pattern of PDK1 was examined by bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry. A total of 101 cases of BLCA were selected for tissue microarrays (TMAs) that contained both tumour and paired normal tissues. We demonstrated that PDK1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and Ki67expression in our TMA cohort (all p values \u003C 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with MIBC with high PDK1 expression had a worse prognosis than patients with low PDK1 expression (p = 0.016). Multifactor risk analysis showed that increased PDK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival of MIBC patients. GSEA showed that the mTOR pathway, HIF pathway, glycolysis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, etc. were differentially enriched in the PDK1 high expression phenotype. Hence, PDK1 may be a prognostic and therapeutic target for MIBC.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jinfeng; Zheng, Guihua; Xu, Haifei; Jin, Xiaoxia; Tang, Ting; Wang, Xiaolin","journal":"Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-020-02782-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIBC","BLCA","TMA","GSEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of PDK1","high PDK1 expression","increased PDK1 expression","low PDK1 expression","expression pattern of PDK1","PDK1 high expression phenotype","overall survival of MIBC patients","prognostic markers","mTOR pathway","worse prognosis","bioinformatics analysis","poor prognosis","Kaplan-Meier survival analysis","independent prognostic factor","Multifactor risk analysis","Muscular infiltrating bladder urothelial carcinoma","HIF pathway","tumour grade","mTOR signalling","cases of BLCA","p values","new therapeutic targets","glycolysis","PI3K","key regulator of glucose metabolism","TMA cohort","AKT","quality of life","postoperative complications","Ki67expression","malignant disease","tissue microarrays","Radical cystectomy","standard treatment","surgery","paired normal tissues","TMAs","effect","total","immunohistochemistry","GSEA"],"language":"en"},

We undertook a systematic review of studies describing delirium in adult medical patients in secondary care.

METHODS We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, only including studies using internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for delirium (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases). Estimates were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis, and we estimated temporal changes using meta-regression. We investigated publication bias with funnel plots. RESULTS We identified 15 further studies to add to 18 studies from the original review. Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19-26%) (33 studies) though this varied according to diagnostic criteria used (highest in DSM-IV, lowest in DSM-5). There was no change from 1980 to 2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. Overall, risk of bias was moderate or low, though there was evidence of increasing publication bias over time.

This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) on blood loss and transfusion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients in comparison with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) or GA. METHODS Totally, 240 patients (aged \u226565 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] I-III) scheduled for posterior THA were enrolled from September 1st, 2017 to March 1st, 2018. All cases were randomly divided into three groups to receive CSEA (group C, n = 80), GA (group G, n = 80), or subarachnoid anesthesia and propofol TCI (group T, n = 80), respectively. Primary outcomes measured were intra-operative blood loss, autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion, mean arterial pressure at different time points, length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction degree. Furthermore, post-operative pain scores and complications were also observed. The difference of quantitative index between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, repeated measurement generalized linear model, Student-Newman-Keuls test or rank-sum test, while ratio index was analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS Basic characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Intra-operative blood loss in group T (331.53 \u00B1 64.33 mL) and group G (308.03 \u00B1 64.90 mL) were significantly less than group C (455.40 \u00B1 120.48 mL, F = 65.80, P \u003C 0.001). Similarly, the autologous transfusion of group T (130.99 \u00B1 30.36 mL) and group G (124.09 \u00B1 24.34 mL) were also markedly less than group C (178.31 \u00B1 48.68 mL, F = 52.99, P \u003C 0.001). The allogenetic blood transfusion of group C (0 [0, 100.00]) was also significantly larger than group T (0) and group G (0) (Z = 2.47, P = 0.047). Except for the baseline, there were significant differences in mean arterial blood pressures before operation (F = 496.84, P \u003C 0.001), 10-min after the beginning of operation (F = 351.43, P \u003C 0.001), 30-min after the beginning of operation (F = 559.89, P \u003C 0.001), 50-min after the beginning of operation (F = 374.74, P \u003C 0.001), and at the end of operation (F = 26.14, P \u003C 0.001) among the three groups. Length of stay in PACU of group T (9.41 \u00B1 1.19 min) was comparable with group C (8.83 \u00B1 1.26 min), and both were significantly shorter than group G (16.55 \u00B1 3.10 min, F = 352.50, P \u003C 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of length of hospitalization and post-operative visual analog scale scores. Patient satisfaction degree of group T (77/80) was significantly higher than group C (66/80, \u03C7 = 7.96, P = 0.004) and G (69/80, \u03C7 = 5.01, P = 0.025). One patient complained of post-dural puncture headache and two complained of low back pain in group C, while none in group T. Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in group G (10/80) was significantly higher than group T (3/80, \u03C7 = 4.10, P = 0.043) and group C (2/80, \u03C7 = 5.76, P = 0.016). No deep vein thrombosis or delayed post-operative functional exercise was detected. CONCLUSIONS Single subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol TCI seems to perform better than CSEA and GA for posterior THA in elderly patients, with less blood loss and peri-operative transfusion, higher patient satisfaction degree and fewer complications.

METHODS We evaluated total hydroxychloroquine concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric lupus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted hydroxychloroquine concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The average total serum/plasma hydroxychloroquine concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/L in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/L), all studies had approximately one-tenth the necessary concentration for in-vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving hydroxychloroquine long-term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma. Because the therapeutic window for hydroxychloroquine in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Christoph P; Green, Thomas P; Clowse, Megan E B; Gonzalez, Daniel; Maharaj, Anil R; Schanberg, Laura E; Eudy, Amanda M; Swamy, Geeta K; Hughes, Brenna L; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael","journal":"The Journal of rheumatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.200493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393664/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["target concentrations","plasma hydroxychloroquine concentrations","total hydroxychloroquine concentrations","plasma concentrations","predicted hydroxychloroquine concentrations","hydroxychloroquine exposure","long-term hydroxychloroquine","hydroxychloroquine long-term","simulated concentrations","tissue concentrations","target exposures","patients","lowest SARS-CoV","average total serum","total plasma concentration","coronavirus SARS-CoV","highest antiviral target exposure","lowest median target exposure","rheumatic diseases","setting of SARS","pregnant adults","frozen serum samples","reported antiviral activity","published pharmacokinetic model","pregnancy","studies","Pharmacokinetic model simulations","average patient","necessary concentration","published literature values","vitro viral inhibition","children","pediatric lupus trial","common dosing","well-designed clinical trials","treatment","safety","day","therapeutic window","models","efficacy","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","dosage","CONCLUSION","source","dose"],"language":"en"},

It is currently unclear whether the \u00B5-oscillation phase effects on corticospinal excitability demonstrated previously for the motor-dominant M1 are also different between motor-dominant and motor-non-dominant M1 or, alternatively, are similar to reflect a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest. Here, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the hand representations of the motor-dominant and the motor-non-dominant M1 of 51 healthy right-handed volunteers when electroencephalography indicated a certain \u00B5-oscillation phase (positive peak, negative peak, or random). We determined resting motor threshold (RMT) as a marker of corticospinal excitability in the three \u00B5-phase conditions. RMT differed significantly depending on the pre-stimulus phase of the \u00B5-oscillation in both M1, with highest RMT in the positive-peak condition, and lowest RMT in the negative-peak condition. \u00B5-phase-dependency of RMT correlated directly between the two M1, and interhemispheric differences in \u00B5-phase-dependency were absent.

Recently, Colombo and Impicciatore compared the deaths in 1084 selected municipalities between 21 February 2020 and 21 March 2020 with deaths in the same time period in 2015 to 2019. We extend analyses of data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and calculate SMRs for all causes of death in the nine selected regions of Italy, separately for men and women and summarized. We analyze the effect of covariables by Poisson modelling and discuss the limitations of the current elaborations. We conclude: In agreement with Colombo and Impicciatore, in the particular corona situation, this \u0022mortality excess loupe\u0022 - assuming otherwise constant determinants of death - can be a virus-test-independent tool to determine mortality effects of SARS-CoV-2. The current \u0022loupe\u0022 is focused on municipalities with increases of more than 20% deaths in March 2020 compared to the average deaths on the same days in 2015-2019. The time window of investigation could be opened before 21 February 2020 to detect masked increases in mortality before the first \u0022COVID-19 death\u0022 was ascertained. The current \u0022loupe\u0022 conveys pronounced mortality increases also in regions that were not considered to be corona hotspots. In this respect, even in the absence of representative virus test results, mortality data can be important indicators of the distribution or spread of a newly acting factor. Overall, it is advisable to carry out SMR analyses for Germany on a regular basis, differentiated by region, gender, age group and cause of death. Such analyses can contribute to the early detection and evaluation of the severity of a deadly pandemic (\u0022burden of disease\u0022) as well as to monitoring the dynamic spread of a factor such as SARS-CoV-2. SMR analyses can also be used to assess and evaluate both desired and undesired effects of measures taken against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 - and possibly other epidemics or pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morfeld, Peter; Erren, Thomas C","journal":"Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1160-5859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institute of Statistics","SMR"],"locations":["Colombo","Germany"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","mortality effects of SARS","mortality data","pronounced mortality","mortality excess loupe","analyses of data","SMR analyses","COVID","cause of death","causes of death","average deaths","virus-test","Impicciatore","constant determinants of death","selected regions of Italy","selected municipalities","Colombo","current elaborations","masked increases","corona hotspots","acting factor","time period","dynamic spread","absence of representative virus test results","undesired effects of measures","particular corona situation","time window of investigation","Italian National Institute of Statistics","independent tool","severity","gender","ISTAT","age group","regular basis","deadly pandemic","important indicators","Poisson modelling","evaluation","limitations","early detection","SMRs","Germany","effect of covariables","burden of disease","distribution","women","days","agreement","epidemics","pandemics","respect"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN Adult laparoscopic primary bariatric procedures were queried from the 2015 and 2016 MBSAQIP registry. Adjusted logistic and multinomial regressions were used to examine the relationships between race and 30-day complications categorized by the Clavien-Dindo grading system. RESULTS A total of 212,970 patients were included in the regression analyses. For Black patients, readmissions were higher (OR = 1.39, p \u003C 0.0001) and the odds of a Grade 1, 3, 4, or 5 complication were increased compared with White patients (OR = 1.21, p \u003C 0.0001; OR = 1.21, p \u003C 0.0001; OR = 1.22, p = 0.01; and OR = 1.43, p = 0.04) respectively. The odds of a Grade 3 complication for Hispanic patients were higher compared with White patients (OR = 1.59, p \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSION Black patients have higher odds of readmission and multiple grades of complications (including death) compared with White patients. Hispanic patients have higher odds of a Grade 3 complication compared with White patients. No significant differences were found with other races. Specific causes of these disparities are beyond the limitations of the dataset and stand as a topic for future inquiry.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Welsh, Leonard K; Luhrs, Andrew R; Davalos, Gerardo; Diaz, Ramon; Narvaez, Andres; Perez, Juan Esteban; Lerebours, Reginald; Kuchibhatla, Maragatha; Portenier, Dana D; Guerron, Alfredo D","journal":"Obesity surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04657-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["White patients","Hispanic patients","CONCLUSION Black patients","higher odds of readmission","complication severity","postoperative complications","day complications","multiple grades of complications","bariatric surgery","relationship of race","BACKGROUND Racial disparities","STUDY DESIGN Adult laparoscopic primary bariatric procedures","death","Clavien-Dindo grading system","topic","relationships","readmissions","multinomial regressions","significant differences","races","future inquiry","dataset","limitations","Specific causes","regression analyses","MBSAQIP registry","total"],"language":"en"},

By contrast, gut Th22 cells are usually restored at normal frequencies. Th22 cells display a CCR6\u002BCCR10\u002B phenotype and could thus respond to CCL20- and CCL28-mediated chemotaxis, while Th17 cells, which express CCR6 but not CCR10, depend on CCL20. Herein, we found that CCL28 is normally expressed by duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV-1-infected individuals, while CCL20 expression is blunted. Ex vivo, we showed that Th22 cells contribute to the reduction of CCL20 production by enterocytes through an IL-22- and IL-18-dependent mechanism. Th22 cells preferentially migrate via CCL20- rather than CCL28-mediated chemotaxis when both chemokines are available in the microenvironment. However, when the CCL20/CCL28 ratio drops, as in treated HIV-1-infected individuals, Th22 cells can migrate via the CCR10-CCL28 axis, as an alternative to CCR6-CCL20. This could explain the better reconstitution of gut Th22 compared with Th17 cells on antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the frequencies of gut Th17 and Th22 cells and inflammatory markers related to microbial translocation, and showed that Th22 cells do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayrac, Manon; Requena, Mary; Loiseau, Claire; Cazabat, Michelle; Suc, Bertrand; Carrere, Nicolas; Barange, Karl; Alric, Laurent; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Izopet, Jacques; Delobel, Pierre","journal":"Mucosal immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-020-0286-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut Th22 cells","T cells","loss of Th17 cells","CCR6-CCL20","infected individuals","CCL20 expression","frequencies of gut Th17","better reconstitution of gut Th22","CCL28-mediated chemotaxis","CCR10-CCL28 axis","reduction of CCL20 production","CCL28 ratio","duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV","Gut CD4","antiretroviral therapy","express CCR6","IL","normal frequencies","inflammatory markers","chemokines","key subset","microbial translocation","alternative","mucosal homeostasis","relationships","phenotype","contrast","microenvironment","dependent mechanism"],"language":"en"},

However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress. In this regard, these findings provide a greater understanding of the chronological effects of experimentally induced heat stress on bovine sperm, providing valuable insights about spermatogenesis during the first 28 days following heat stress.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Oliveros, Laura Nataly; de Arruda, Rubens Paes; Batissaco, Leonardo; Gonzaga, Vitor Hugo Guilger; Nogueira, Vin\u00EDcius Jos\u00E9 Moreira; Florez-Rodriguez, Shirley Andrea; Almeida, Fl\u00E1via Dos Santos; Alves, Ma\u00EDra Bianchi Rodrigues; Pinto, S\u00E2mara Cristine Costa; Nichi, Marcilio; Losano, Jo\u00E3o Diego de Agostini; Kawai, Giulia Kiyomi Vechiato; Celeghini, Eneiva Carla Carvalho","journal":"International journal of biometeorology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-01917-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Heat stress effects","sperm abnormalities","sperm lipid peroxidation","sperm motility","Testicular heat stress","induced heat stress","bovine sperm","initial effects of heat stress","sperm DNA fragmentation","days","early sequential effects of heat stress","bull sperm quality","plasma membrane integrity","seminal plasma lipid peroxidation","presence of oxidative stress","acrosomal membrane integrity","mitochondrial membrane function","Blood plasma","mitochondrial membrane potential","chronological effects","mitochondrial function","Semen samples","increase","blood samples of Nellore breed bulls","scrotal bags","control","time","greater understanding","valuable insights","spermatogenesis","fertility","turn","late effect","findings","groups","regard","study","chronology"],"language":"en"},

Two consecutive VOT\u0027s were performed on healthy volunteers and tissue oxygenation was measured with MSI and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Correlations between the rate of desaturation, recovery and the hyperemic area under the curve (AUC) measured by MSI and NIRS were calculated. Fifty-eight volunteers were included. The MSI oxygenation curves showed identifiable components of the VOT, including a desaturation and recovery slope and hyperemic area under the curve, similar to those measured with NIRS. The correlation between the rate of desaturation measured by MSI and NIRS was moderate: r = 0.42 (p = 0.001) for the first and r = 0.41 (p = 0.002) for the second test. Our results suggest that non-contact multispectral imaging is able to measure changes in regional oxygenation and deoxygenation during a vascular occlusion test in healthy volunteers.

The objective of the present study was to examine the behavior and ultrastructure of gonocytes in culture. Neonatal porcine testis cells were cultured for 4 weeks and underwent live-cell imaging to explore real-time interactions among cultured cells. This included imaging every 1 h from day 0 to day 3, every 2 h from day 4 to day 7, and every 1 h for 24 h at days 14, 21, and 28. Samples also underwent scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, morphometric evaluations, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR. Live-cell imaging revealed an active amoeboid-like movement of gonocytes, assisted by the formation of extensive cytoplasmic projections, which, using scanning electron microscopy, were categorized into spike-like filopodia, leaf-like lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and cytoplasmic blebs. In the first week of culture, gonocytes formed loose attachments on top of a somatic cell monolayer and, in week 2, formed grape-like clusters, which, over time, grew in cell number. Starting at week 3 of culture, some of the gonocyte clusters transformed into large multinucleated embryoid body-like colonies (EBLCs) that expressed both gonocyte- and pluripotent-specific markers.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was \u003C30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belhadjer, Zahra; M\u00E9ot, Mathilde; Bajolle, Fanny; Khraiche, Diala; Legendre, Antoine; Abakka, Samya; Auriau, Johanne; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Beghetti, Maurice; Wacker, Julie; Ovaert, Caroline; Hascoet, Sebastien; Selegny, Ma\u00EBlle; Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie; Maltret, Alice; Bosser, Gilles; Giroux, Nathan; Bonnemains, Laurent; Bordet, Jeanne; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Mauran, Pierre; Falcon-Eicher, Sylvie; Thambo, Jean-Beno\u00EEt; Lefort, Bruno; Moceri, Pamela; Houyel, Lucile; Renolleau, Sylvain; Bonnet, Damien","journal":"Circulation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.048360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Centers for Disease Control","ECMO"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","infection","children - MIS","ventricular function","multisystem inflammatory syndrome","severe inflammatory state","ventricular dysfunction","recovery of left ventricular systolic function","series of febrile pediatric patients","MIS-C","Median age","pg","years","ventricular ejection fraction","ECMO","pediatric intensive care units","acute cardiac decompensation","D-dimer median","intravenous immune globulin","US Centers","Cardiac injury","acute heart failure","suggestive of cytokine storm","cardiogenic shock","macrophage activation","interleukin","adjunctive steroid therapy","early outcomes data","PCR of nasopharyngeal swab","Inflammation markers","myocarditis","admission","month period contemporary","pandemic","Mean brain natriuretic peptide","Switzerland","serology","Background","Disease Control","range","France","asthma","Gastrointestinal symptoms","Co-morbidities","adults","Treatment","Conclusion","inotropic support","COVID","Methods","Results","study"],"language":"en"},

The motion estimate is used to adapt the radiation beam to the current anatomy, yielding a more conformal dose distribution. As the MR acquisition is the largest component of latency, deep learning (DL) may reduce the total latency by enabling much higher undersampling factors compared to conventional reconstruction and motion estimation methods. The benefit of DL on image reconstruction and motion estimation was investigated for obtaining accurate deformation vector fields (DVFs) with high temporal resolution and minimal latency.Methods: 2D cine MRI acquired at 1.5T from 135 abdominal cancer patients were retrospectively included in this study. Undersampled radial golden angle acquisitions were retrospectively simulated. DVFs were computed using different combinations of conventional- and DL-based methods for image reconstruction and motion estimation, allowing a comparison of four approaches to achieve real-time motion estimation. The four approaches were evaluated based on the end-point-error and root-mean-square error compared to a ground-truth optical flow estimate on fully-sampled images, the structural similarity (SSIM) after registration and time necessary to acquire k-space, reconstruct an image and estimate motion.Results: The lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional methods up to R\u226410. For undersampling factors R\u003E10, the lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional image reconstruction and DL-based motion estimation. We have found that, with this combination, accurate DVFs can be obtained up to R=25 with an average root-mean-square error up to 1 millimeter and an SSIM greater than 0.8 after registration, taking 60 milliseconds.Conclusion: High-quality 2D DVFs from highly undersampled k-space can be obtained with a high temporal resolution with conventional image reconstruction and a deep learning-based motion estimation approach for real-time adaptive MRI-guided radiotherapy.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terpstra, Maarten Lennart; Maspero, Matteo; D\u0027Agata, Federico; Stemkens, Bjorn; Intven, Martijn P W; Lagendijk, Jan J W; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Tijssen, Rob H N","journal":"Physics in medicine and biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab9358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408295/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DVF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["motion estimation methods","real-time motion estimation","motion estimate","conventional reconstruction","conventional image reconstruction","conventional methods","deep learning-based motion estimation approach","based methods","square error","highest SSIM","lowest DVF error","D DVFs","accurate DVFs","SSIM greater","minimal latency","total latency","low latency","different combinations of conventional","undersampling factors R","real-time adaptive MRI-guided radiotherapy","high temporal resolution","D cine MRI","real-time adaptation","largest component of latency","registration","space","approaches","higher undersampling factors","average root","accurate deformation vector fields","Undersampled radial golden angle acquisitions","sampled images","magnetic resonance imaging","structural similarity","Conclusion","Results","current anatomy","ground-truth optical flow","milliseconds","time necessary","millimeter","comparison","radiation beam","MR acquisition","abdominal cancer patients","end-point","conformal dose distribution","Purpose","benefit","study"],"language":"en"},

A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults, those with immune disorders and co-morbidities. Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection. It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of providing anesthesiology and intensive care services.

Due to the potential genetic diversity of some viruses, such as HIV-1 and influenza, standard neutralizing antibodies are often ineffective or easily evaded as their targets are masked or rapidly mutated. This has thwarted efforts to both prevent and treat HIV-1 infections and means that entirely new formulations are required to vaccinate against influenza each year. However, some rare antibodies isolated from infected individuals confer broad and potent neutralization. A subset of these broadly neutralizing antibodies possesses a long complementarity-determining 3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (CDR H3). This feature generates unique antigen binding site configurations that can engage conserved but otherwise inaccessible epitope targets thus neutralizing many viral variants. Remarkably, ultralong CDR H3s are a common feature of the cow antibody repertoire and are encoded by a single variable, diversity, joining (VDJ) recombination that is extensively diversified prior to antigen exposure. Recently, it was shown that cows rapidly generate a broadly neutralizing response upon exposure to HIV-1 and this is primarily mediated by these novel ultralong antibody types. This review summarises the current knowledge of these unusual CDR H3 structures and discusses their known and potential future uses.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burke, Matthew J; Stockley, Peter G; Boyes, Joan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12040473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32331321/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV","standard neutralizing antibodies","neutralizing response","Potent antibody-mediated neutralization","potent neutralization","ultralong CDR H3s","rare antibodies","influenza","antigen exposure","unusual CDR H3 structures","novel ultralong antibody types","cow antibody repertoire","potential genetic diversity","common feature","inaccessible epitope targets","potential future uses","unique antigen binding site configurations","infected individuals","current knowledge","region","organism","immunoglobulin heavy chain","long complementarity","viruses","viral variants","vast array of pathogens","VDJ","single variable","infections","recombination","new formulations","review","cows","subset","lifetime","year","efforts"],"language":"en"},

We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. METHODS We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). CONCLUSION In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive. The continued monitoring of testing and results will help providers understand how COVID-19 is progressing in the community.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tolia, Vaishal M; Chan, Theodore C; Castillo, Edward M","journal":"The western journal of emergency medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.3.47348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223871/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection testing","targeted testing","days of testing","ED patients","acute COVID","majority of patients","data","targeted program of COVID","continued monitoring of testing","high-risk patients","test results","qualifying criteria","common criteria","results groups","preliminary results","widespread infection","study EDs","Symptoms-based criteria","initial period","review","total","day study period","global pandemic","Disease Control","Centers","combined census","male","clinical characteristics","Emergency Severity Index score","years of age","World Health Organization","limited resources","Prevention guidelines","included demographics","novel coronavirus","investigation","patient encounters","descriptive statistics","providers","contact","initiation","institution","vs","INTRODUCTION","tests","METHODS","CONCLUSION","fever","persons","community"],"language":"en"},

To expand our understanding of hygienic triggers and improve hygienic selection tools, we tested the hypothesis that the cuticular compounds (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene, previously associated with unhealthy honey bee brood and/or brood targeted for hygiene, are triggers of honey bee hygienic behavior independent of brood health. In support of our hypothesis, application of synthetic (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene onto brood and brood cell caps significantly increased hygienic behavior compared to application of similarly structured hydrocarbon controls (Z)-16-dotriacontene and (Z)-7-pentadecene. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant positive correlation between colony-level hygienic responses to (Z)-10-tritriacontene and the traditional freeze-killed brood assay for selection of hygienic honey bee stocks. These results confirm biological activity of (Z)-6-pentadecene and reveal (Z)-10-tritriacontene as a novel hygiene trigger. They also support development of improved tools for honey bee colony monitoring and hygienic selection, and thus may accelerate development of honey bee stocks with greater resistance to Varroa and associated pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wagoner, Kaira M; Millar, Jocelyn G; Schal, Coby; Rueppell, Olav","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64144-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selection of hygienic honey bee stocks","unhealthy honey bee brood","honey bee hygienic behavior independent of brood health","hygienic selection tools","development of honey bee stocks","honey bee colony monitoring","health of western honey bee","honey bees","pentadecene","tritriacontene","understanding of hygienic triggers","brood assay","colony-level hygienic responses","brood cell caps","hypothesis","associated pathogens","support","development of improved tools","application of synthetic","numerous harmful pathogens","novel hygiene trigger","parasitic mite Varroa destructor","greater resistance","colonies","Apis mellifera","mites\u0027 impact","significant positive correlation","social immune trait","traditional freeze","structured hydrocarbon controls","sustainable approach","results","biological activity","cuticular compounds","Selective breeding","reveal","dotriacontene"],"language":"en"},

However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as persons with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE To examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors among persons with serious mental illness and the behaviors taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. METHODS Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and non-psychiatric control participants who are currently or previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April, 2020 through August, 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at two time points to assess their current emotional functioning and measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, and demographic, cognitive and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. RESULTS Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS Findings have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness, and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.

A statistically significant decrease in heart rate was observed 2 min after administration of alfaxalone at 15 mg/kg; however, this finding was noted to be transient. A statistically significant decrease in respiratory rate was observed at 6 and 10 min after injection in both groups. Cloacal temperature measurement with a digital thermometer and eye temperature calculated from thermographic images demonstrated a decrease in body temperature over time but was not found to be statistically significant. Intramuscular use of alfaxalone proved to provide short-term sedation in budgerigars, with statistically significant but clinically mild cardiorespiratory effects. Due to a significant decrease in body temperature, active warming is recommended when using alfaxalone in budgerigars.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, Jon; Hasse, Kayla; Johnston, Matthew","journal":"Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1638/2019-0059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant decrease","administration of alfaxalone","intramuscular injection of alfaxalone","body temperature","Intramuscular use of alfaxalone","eye temperature","moderate sedation","short-term sedation","male budgerigars","higher dose","lower dose","Cloacal temperature measurement","mild cardiorespiratory effects","profound sedation","various dose ranges","thermoregulatory effects","short-term sedative","heart rate","respiratory rate","crossover study","multiple routes of administration","avian species","digital thermometer","thermographic images","active warming","Previous studies","sample size","Melopsittacus undulatus","physical examination","neurosteroid anesthetic agent","time","veterinary medicine","finding","aim","groups","doses"],"language":"en"},

A major question during the last decades has centred on understanding whether new advances in developmental biology are compatible with the standard view or whether they compel a new theory. Here, I argue that the answer to this question depends on which concept of morphogenesis is held. Morphogenesis can be conceived as (1) a chemically driven or (2) a mechanically driven process. According to the first option, genetic regulatory networks drive morphogenesis. According to the second, morphogenesis results from an invariant tendency of embryonic tissues to restore changes in mechanical stress. While chemically driven morphogenesis allows an extension of the standard view, mechanically driven morphogenesis would deeply transform it. Which of these hypotheses has wider explanatory power is unknown. At present, the problem of biological form remains unsolved.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linde-Medina, Marta","journal":"Theory in biosciences = Theorie in den Biowissenschaften","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12064-020-00317-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["driven morphogenesis","morphogenesis results","concept of morphogenesis","driven process","standard view","problem of biological form","theories of biological form","new advances","Embryonic development","new theory","major question","invariant tendency of embryonic tissues","developmental biology","changes","understanding","Modern Synthesis","hypotheses","wider explanatory power","decades","option","genetic regulatory networks","extension","conceptual framework","mechanical stress","present","answer"],"language":"en"},

The main country being affected is China followed by Italy, Iran, Spain, France, and the USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Since there are no effective drugs available against Coronavirus, we conducted virtual screening of phytochemicals to find novel compounds against this virus. Hence, we created a phytochemical library of 318 phytochemicals from 11 plants which have been reported as antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal activity. The phytochemical library was subjected to virtual screening against molecular targets; Main protease (Mpro) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). RESULTS Top 10 compounds were selected from each target which had better and significantly low binding energy as compared to the reference molecule. CONCLUSIONS Based on the binding energy score, we suggest that these compounds can be tested against Coronavirus and used to develop effective antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joshi, T; Joshi, T; Sharma, P; Mathpal, S; Pundir, H; Bhatt, V; Chandra, S","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202004_21036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373991/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO"],"locations":["China","Iran","France"],"keyphrases":["Coronavirus COVID","effective drugs available","effective antiviral drugs","virtual screening of phytochemicals","effective vaccine","novel compounds","people","phytochemical library","binding energy score","low binding energy","Main protease","main country","Mpro","molecular targets","cause illnesses","Angiotensin","Spain","France","Italy","Iran","China","animals","markets","respiratory tract","Enzyme","antifungal activity","CONCLUSIONS","plants","METHODS","world","reference molecule","USA","ACE2","pandemic","OBJECTIVE","control","MATERIALS","RESULTS","countries","deaths"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A retrospective, observational study encompassing all patients admitted with a diagnosis of HF over two 12-month periods before (2012/2013), and after (2015/2016) IHFS establishment. RESULTS Total admissions for HF increased by 40% (385 vs 540), with a greater number admitted to the cardiology ward (231 vs 121). After IHFS implementation, patients were more likely to see a cardiologist (35.1% vs 43.7%, p=0.009), undergo echocardiography (70.1% vs 81.5%, p\u003C0.001), be initiated on all three disease modifying HF medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)) in the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) group (42% vs 99%, p\u003C0.001) and receive specialist HF input (81.6% vs 85.4%, p=0.2). Both 30-day post-discharge mortality and HF related readmissions were significantly lower in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (8.9% vs 3.1%, p=0.032, 58% reduction, p=0.043 respectively) with no-significant reductions in all other HF groups. In-patient mortality was similar. Length of stay in Cardiology wards increased from 8.4 to 12.7 days (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSION Establishment of an IHFS within a DGH with limited resources and only a modest service re-design has resulted in significantly improved provision of specialist in-patient care, use of HFrEF medications, early heart failure nurse follow-up, and is associated with a reduction in early mortality, particularly in the HFpEF cohort, and HF related readmissions.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hawley, Alasdair; He, Jingzhou; Crabtree, Alice; Iacovides, Stelios; Keeling, Phil","journal":"Open heart","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2019-001218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHFS"],"locations":["Cardiology"],"keyphrases":["vs","HF medications","HF groups","diagnosis of HF","HF related readmissions","provision of HF care","specialist HF input","patients","early mortality","In-patient mortality","IHFS establishment","new integrated heart failure service","early heart failure nurse follow-up","IHFS implementation","HFrEF medications","angiotensin","DGH","improved provision of specialist in-patient care","day post-discharge mortality","reduced ejection fraction","preserved ejection fraction","receptor blockers","HFpEF cohort","Cardiology wards","CONCLUSION Establishment","mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists","modest service re-design","ARB","ACEi","medium-sized district general hospital","readmission rates","limited resources","enzyme inhibitors","impact","MRA","retrospective","observational study","greater number","METHODS","RESULTS Total admissions","significant reductions","disease","OBJECTIVES","Length","days","cardiologist","month periods","echocardiography"],"language":"en"},

It has been increasingly used in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but its efficacy (based on effect size calculations), safety, and stimulation parameters have not been systematically examined. In this systematic review, we aimed to (1) explore the effectiveness of tDCS on the clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits of ADHD patients, (2) evaluate the safety of tDCS application, especially in children with ADHD, (3) model the electrical field intensity in the target regions based on the commonly-applied and effective versus less-effective protocols, and (4) discuss and propose advanced tDCS parameters. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach, a literature search identified 14 empirical experiments investigating tDCS effects in ADHD. Partial improving effects of tDCS on cognitive deficits (response inhibition, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility) or clinical symptoms (e.g., impulsivity and inattention) are reported in 10 studies. No serious adverse effects are reported in 747 sessions of tDCS. The left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are the regions most often targeted, and anodal tDCS the protocol most often applied. An intensity of 2 mA induced stronger electrical fields than 1 mA in adults with ADHD and was associated with significant behavioral changes. In ADHD children, however, the electrical field induced by 1 mA, which is likely larger than the electrical field induced by 1 mA in adults due to the smaller head size of children, was sufficient to result in significant behavioral change. Overall, tDCS seems to be a promising method for improving ADHD deficits. However, the clinical utility of tDCS in ADHD cannot yet be concluded and requires further systematic investigation in larger sample sizes. Cortical regions involved in ADHD pathophysiology, stimulation parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, polarity, and electrode size), and types of symptom/deficit are potential determinants of tDCS efficacy in ADHD.

The study was carried out to test the construct validity of such a simulator by demonstrating differences between beginner and expert neurointerventionalists and to evaluate whether a training effect can be demonstrated in repeated cases for different levels of experience. METHODS In this study 4 experts and 6 beginners performed 10 diagnostic angiographies on the VIST simulator (Mentice AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Of the cases four were non-recurring, whereas three were repeated once and ten subjects performed all tasks. Additionally, another expert performed only five non-recurring cases. The simulator recorded total time, fluoroscopy time, amount of contrast medium and number of material changes. Furthermore, gaze direction and heart rate were recorded, and subjects completed a questionnaire on workload. RESULTS Beginners and experts showed significant differences in total duration time, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent (all p \u003C 0.05). Gaze direction, dwell time and heart rate were similar between both groups. Only beginners improved during training with respect to total duration time, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent. If a case was previously known to them, the total duration and fluoroscopy time were significantly shortened (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated both the construct validity of a diagnostic neuroangiography simulator as well as a significant training effect for beginners. Therefore, in particular beginner neurointerventionalists should use such simulation tools more extensively in their initial training.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kreiser, Kornelia; Str\u00F6ber, Lea; Gehling, Kim G; Schneider, Frederick; Kohlbecher, Stefan; Schulz, Christian M; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S","journal":"Clinical neuroradiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00902-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VIST","Mentice AB"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["fluoroscopy time","total time","total duration time","dwell time","VIST simulator","significant training effect","initial training","study","diagnostic neuroangiography simulator","contrast agent","construct validity","RESULTS Beginners","repeated cases","training of endovascular procedures","non-recurring cases","significant differences","heart rate","experts","contrast medium","gaze direction","expert neurointerventionalists","use","subjects","particular beginner neurointerventionalists","Mentice AB","diagnostic angiographies","Mentice vascular interventional system trainer","respect","simulation tools","Gothenburg","neuroradiology","number of material changes","different levels of experience","Sweden","groups","questionnaire","workload","CONCLUSION","METHODS","PURPOSE Simulators","tasks"],"language":"en"},

Following the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has been an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions. ACE2 is a potential target for many treatment approaches for the SARS-CoV-2. With the help of bioinformatics, we have predicted several novel exons of the human ACE2 gene. The inclusion of novel exons located in the 5\u0027UTR/intronic region in the mature transcript may remove the critical ACE2 residues responsible for the interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing their binding and entry into the cell. Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3\u0027UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions. Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene could similarly be modulated using SSOs to exclude critical domains required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Strategies can also be designed to deliver these SSOs directly to the lungs in order to minimize the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rehman, Sayeed Ur; Tabish, Mohammad","journal":"Clinical science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","entry of SARS","human ACE2 gene","soluble ACE2 isoforms","recent outbreak of SARS","SSOs","critical ACE2 residues responsible","inclusion of novel exons","novel predicted exons","C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2","receptor-binding domain","UTR","alternative splicing","critical domains","therapeutic strategy","therapeutic interventions","renin-angiotensin system","interaction","mature transcript","balance","treatment approaches","RBD","intronic region","potential target","damage","urgent need","disease conditions","Splice","antisense oligonucleotides","lungs","order","essential role","infection","HCoV-NL63","cell","enzyme","pathogenesis","help of bioinformatics","Strategies"],"language":"en"},

This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources. A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and healthcare resource burden. Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of COVID-19 cases develop severe or critical disease. This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in COVID-19 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality.

Morbidity and mortality associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is high, particularly in hospitalized patients. Better risk prediction during hospitalization could improve management and ultimately reduce mortality rates. AIM To evaluate CRP measured at admission and the third day of hospitalization as a predictor for adverse events in CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with CAP at an academic hospital. Major adverse outcomes were admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital length of stay, hospital complications and 30-day mortality. Predictive associations between CRP (as absolute levels and relative decline at third day) and adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS Eight hundred and twenty-three patients were assessed, 19% were admitted to ICU and 10.6% required mechanical ventilation. The average hospital stay was 8.8 \u00B1 8.2 days, 42% had nosocomial complications and 8.1% died within 30 days. Ninety eight percent of patients had elevated serum CRP on admission to the hospital (18.1 \u00B1 14.1 mg/dL). C-reactive protein measured at admission was associated with the risk of bacterial pneumonia, bacteremic pneumonia, septic shock and use of mechanical ventilation. Lack of CRP decline within three days of hospitalization was associated with high risk of complications, septic shock, mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay.

Nowadays, different expression systems are used for the production of recombinant proteins including bacteria, yeasts, molds, mammals, plants, and insects. Yeast expression systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) are more popular. P. pastoris expression system is one of the most popular and standard tools for the production of recombinant protein in molecular biology. Overall, the benefits of protein production by P. pastoris system include appropriate folding (in the endoplasmic reticulum) and secretion (by Kex2 as signal peptidase) of recombinant proteins to the external environment of the cell. Moreover, in the P. pastoris expression system due to its limited production of endogenous secretory proteins, the purification of recombinant protein is easy. It is also considered a unique host for the expression of subunit vaccines which could significantly affect the growing market of medical biotechnology. Although P. pastoris expression systems are impressive and easy to use with well-defined process protocols, some degree of process optimization is required to achieve maximum production of the target proteins. Methanol and sorbitol concentration, Mut forms, temperature and incubation time have to be adjusted to obtain optimal conditions, which might vary among different strains and externally expressed protein. Eventually, optimal conditions for the production of a recombinant protein in P. pastoris expression system differ according to the target protein.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karbalaei, Mohsen; Rezaee, Seyed A; Farsiani, Hadi","journal":"Journal of cellular physiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32057111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of recombinant proteins","pastoris expression systems","production of recombinant proteins","pastoris system","different expression systems","biological expression systems","Yeast expression systems","purification of recombinant protein","benefits of protein production","Pichia pastoris","expression of subunit vaccines","maximum production","target proteins","expressed protein","limited production of endogenous secretory proteins","optimal conditions","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","different strains","well-defined process protocols","degree of process optimization","Mut forms","temperature","yeasts","bacteria","appropriate folding","mammals","secretion","sorbitol concentration","molds","Kex2","signal peptidase","endoplasmic reticulum","important branches of genetic engineering","standard tools","plants","incubation time","Methanol","external environment","molecular biology","unique host","growing market of medical biotechnology","insects","cell"],"language":"en"},

However, lifting restrictions is also a population response to their socio-economic impacts, and is expected to increase COVID-19 cases, in turn. This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies a coupled behaviour-disease system. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model of the interaction between social support for school and workplace closure and the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We find that a second wave of COVID-19 occurs across a broad range of plausible model input parameters, on account of instabilities generated by behaviour-disease interactions.

Suppression of the inflammatory response with immunomodulatory therapies may be a potential therapeutic strategy. We systematically review and assess the effectiveness of specific interleukin-1 and -6 inhibitors for the treatment of coronavirus-related infections. Methods Electronic databases, pre-print servers and clinical trial registries were searched to identify current and ongoing studies of immunomodulatory agents (anakinra, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab) for the treatment of Covid-19 and other coronavirus related super infections. The co-primary outcome was time to hospital discharge (days) and severity on an ordinal scale measured at day 15. Results Five retrospective studies (tocilizumab, two case series and two case reports; siltuximab, one case series) were shortlisted for inclusion, totalling 59 patients. All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias, with multiple limitations. Insufficient data and inter-study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were inconsistently reported but suggest many patients experienced an improvement in status seven days following therapy. The case fatality ratio (CFR) of patients with severe Covid-19 included in our review was 6.8%, a figure substantially lower than that estimated in non-interventional case series. Of the studies measuring IL-6, all reported elevated baseline levels. Twenty-five ongoing registered clinical trials exploring immunomodulatory agents in Covid-19 were identified, although inconsistency in participants and endpoints are noted. Conclusion Inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab and siltuximab requires further evaluation in managing the assumed hyperinflammatory response associated with severe Covid-19. These early data are considered hypothesis generating and justify the need for well-designed randomised clinical studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Fasihul; Fabbri, Laura; Stewart, Iain; Robinson, Karen; Smyth, Alan R; Jenkins, Gisli","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfa1c9fbbacd1b653794c54a6adce6b18c7fc18f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076612v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe Covid","treatment of Covid","ongoing studies of immunomodulatory agents","tocilizumab","case reports","siltuximab","retrospective studies","patients","non-interventional case series","well-designed randomised clinical studies","case fatality ratio","immunomodulatory therapies","days","immune response","treatment of coronavirus","related infections","review","ongoing registered clinical trials","clinical trial registries","assumed hyperinflammatory response","Insufficient data","early data","Primary outcomes","super infections","co-primary outcome","Conclusion Inhibition of IL","release of pro-inflammatory cytokines","pre-print servers","anakinra","hospital discharge","inter-study heterogeneity","time","CFR","high risk of bias","severity","Methods Electronic databases","need","evaluation","sarilumab","meta-analysis","improvement","status","potential therapeutic strategy","multiple limitations","ordinal scale","hypothesis","therapy","evidence","inhibitors","Results","Suppression","inclusion","effectiveness of specific interleukin","elevated baseline levels","inconsistency","participants","endpoints","figure","Background"],"language":"en"},

In Europe, this is of particular relevance with ageing populations living with non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty. Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects. Our aim was to identify the countries across Europe that have populations at highest risk from COVID-19 by using estimates of population age structure and YLD for health conditions linked to severe illness from COVID-19. Methods: Population and YLD estimates from GBD 2017 were extracted for 45 countries in Europe. YLD was restricted to a list of specific health conditions associated with being at risk of developing severe consequences from COVID-19 based on guidance from the United Kingdom Government. This guidance also identified individuals aged 70 years and above as being at higher risk of developing severe health consequences. Study outcomes were defined as: (i) proportion of population aged 70 years and above; and (ii) rate of YLD for COVID-19 for vulnerable health conditions across all ages. Bivariate groupings were established for each outcome and combined to establish overall population-level vulnerability. Results: Countries with the highest proportions of elderly residents were Italy, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Finland. When assessments of population-level YLD rates for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions were made the highest rates were observed for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A bivariate analysis indicated that the countries at high-risk across both measures of vulnerability were: Bulgaria; Portugal; Latvia; Lithuania; Greece; Germany; Estonia; and Sweden. Conclusion: Routine estimates of population structures and non-fatal burden of disease measures can be usefully combined to create composite indicators of vulnerability for rapid assessments, in this case to severe health consequences from COVID-19. Countries with available results for sub-national regions within their country, or national burden of disease studies that also use sub-national levels for burden quantifications, should consider using non-fatal burden of disease estimates to estimate geographical vulnerability to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wyper, G.

Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169\u002B macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2\u002B cells, CD169\u002B macrophages, but not in CD3\u002B T cells or B220\u002B B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis.

Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out. Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torneri, Andrea; Libin, Pieter Jules Karel; Vanderlocht, Joris; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Neyts, Johan; Hens, Niel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d37e4948cc2342320608f44affdda2cafee28a61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038182","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of COVID","use of contact tracing","Control measures","contact tracing process","quarantine","ongoing COVID","resulting control measure","re-emerging outbreaks of COVID","Current outbreaks of COVID","antiviral drug","local outbreaks","perfect isolation","significant decrease","ongoing epidemic","testing of individuals","intervention technique","efficacy of different intervention measures","addition","effect of infectiousness","monitoring","simulation-based model of viral transmission","potent antiviral compound","presymptomatic infections","symptom onset","symptoms onset","viral load","tested scenarios","significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees","recent modelling work","final size","effective strategy","administration","procedures","results","combination","infectious disease","countries","peak incidence","benefits","health care systems","probability","feasibility","Background","order","incubation period","world","Interpretation","Antivirals","Methods","burden","Findings","respect"],"language":"en"},

We created the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study (BICS) to help achieve this goal. Here, we report the first set of BICS results, based on data collected in the United States between March 22, 2020 and April 8, 2020. We find evidence that rates of interpersonal contact have greatly been reduced at all ages in the United States.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feehan, Dennis; Mahmud, Ayesha","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b748dfa80b6100eff150eb3253c94c96d4f7928.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20064014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["United States","close interpersonal contact","rates of interpersonal contact","interpersonal interaction","Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study","virus","set of BICS results","strong social distancing measures","daily activities","transmission","orders","data","policymakers","policies","majority of people","evidence","population","researchers","extent","spread","ages","start","COVID","goal"],"language":"en"},

The paper identifies the main contours of scientific research in Antarctica before exploring commercially oriented biodiversity research and development in the scientific literature and patent publications. The paper argues that biodiversity is not a free good and must be paid for. Ways forward in debates on commercial research and development in Antarctica can be found through increasing attention to the valuation of ecosystem services, new approaches to natural capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services that would bring the Antarctic, and the Antarctic Treaty System, into the wider fold of work on the economics of biodiversity. Economics based approaches can be criticised for reducing biodiversity to monetary exchange values at the expense of recognition of the wider values of biodiversity and its services. However, approaches grounded in the economics of biodiversity provide a transparent framework for approaching commercial activity in the Antarctic and introducing requirements for investments in the conservation of Antarctic biodiversity by those who seek to profit from it.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oldham, Paul; Kindness, Jasmine","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf56dc5fb4fec54ad75f2402c22b411d56419366.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074849","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Microsoft Academic Graph","Global Biodiversity Information Facility"],"locations":["Antarctica","Antarctic","Southern Ocean"],"keyphrases":["economics of biodiversity","conservation of Antarctic biodiversity","oriented biodiversity research","wider values of biodiversity","Antarctic species","Antarctica","commercial research","scientific literature","Global Biodiversity Information Facility","paper","Antarctic Treaty System","main contours of scientific research","scientific articles","patent literature","valuation of ecosystem services","development","new approaches","patent families","patent publications","commercial activity","wider fold of work","monetary exchange values","natural capital accounting","taxonomic data","payment","expense of recognition","innovation","Lens","growing availability of open access databases","GBIF","transparent framework","Microsoft Academic Graph","investments","increasing attention","Southern Ocean","review","requirements","debates","Ways","scale"],"language":"en"},

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3\u002B T cells, CD4\u002B T cells, CD8\u002B T cells, CD19\u002B B cells, and CD16\u002B56\u002B NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Lilei; Tong, Yongqing; Shen, Gaigai; Fu, Aisi; Lai, Yanqiu; Zhou, Xiaoya; Yuan, Yuan; Wang, Yuhong; Pan, Yuchen; Yu, Zhiyao; Li, Yan; Liu, Tiangang; Jiang, Hong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/594d23a412649df7dbfef5347a2a0c208ed4417d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030650","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","National Health Commission","Nanopore Targeted Sequencing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune disorder","expression levels of immune cells","T cells","refractory hypoxemia","critical patients","dynamic characteristics of immune system","hypoxemia severity","severity of hypoxemia","NK cells","B cells","host immune cell levels","dynamic characteristics of host immune system","clinical characteristics","outbreak of COVID","imbalance of gut microbiota","gut microbiota imbalance","changes of gut microbes of COVID","gut dysbiosis","potential high risk subtype of COVID","high risk of fatal pneumonia","basic clinical features","alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis","clinical outcome","vicious circle","demographic features","Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","designated hospital","retrospective study","proportion of probiotics","National Health Commission of China4","global public health emergency","proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria","symptoms","CD3","signs","CD19","CD8","CD4","relationship","edition","CD16","hospitalization","nCoV infection","epidemiological history","Eubacterium","Diagnosis","different time points","immunodepletion","Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria","Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes","previously4","Nanopore Targeted Sequencing","Bifidobacterium","Lactobacillus","knowledge","Methods","Conclusions","Blood samples","best"],"language":"en"},

Methods We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases and for different exposure settings. Results Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases) were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5-1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1-4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0-0.61%). The attack rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7-29.5%) and non-household family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4-20.3%) than that in healthcare or other settings. The higher secondary clinical attack rate for contacts near symptom onset remained when the analysis was restricted to household and family contacts. There was a trend of increasing attack rate with the age of contacts (p for trend \u003C 0.001). Conclusions High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized social distancing measures are required.

Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. Objective The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. Methods Using over 34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 373 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the four primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by three expert cardiologists. Results Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1, sensitivity increases to 90.0%. The algorithm detects moderate-to-severe or greater aortic stenosis with sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 77.7% and detects moderate-to-severe or greater mitral regurgitation with sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity of 90.5%.

Water is ubiquitous in most ecosystems, and, among invertebrates, terrestrial haematophagous leeches are abundant and can be easily collected in many tropical rainforests [3,4]. Such non-invasive nucleic acid sources can mitigate difficulties of obtaining wildlife samples, particularly in remote areas or for rare species. Recently, eDNA/iDNA sources have been applied to monitoring specific wildlife pathogens [5,6]. However, previous studies have focused on known pathogens, whereas most wildlife pathogens are uncharacterized and unknown. Non-invasive approaches to monitoring known and novel pathogens may be of particular benefit in ecosystems prone to viral emergence, many of which occur in areas where invasive sampling is challenging, such as tropical rainforests. Here, we show that both eDNA from natural waterholes, and iDNA from terrestrial haematophagous leeches, can be used to detect unknown viruses circulating in mammalian hosts (Figure 1). Using a curated set of RNA oligonucleotides based on the ViroChip microarray assay [7] as baits in a hybridization capture system, multiple mammalian RNA and DNA viruses were detected from both eDNA and iDNA samples. Congruence was found between host DNA assignment and viruses identified in leeches, and between animals observed visiting the waterholes and the viruses detected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA/iDNA samples may represent an effective non-invasive resource for studying wildlife viral diversity. Several of the detected viruses were novel, highlighting the potential of eDNA/iDNA for epidemiological analysis of emerging viruses prior to their emergence. Highlights Environmental DNA (water and blood-sucking leeches) provided a non-invasive method of screening wildlife for viruses A comprehensive viral RNA oligonucleotide bait set was developed to capture known and unknown mammalian virus diversity Leech blood meal host determination and viruses identified were congruent Viruses determined from water correlated with known and observed species visiting the water sources In brief Alfano, Dayaram, et al. demonstrate that environmental DNA from southeast Asian leech bloodmeals and waterholes from Africa and Mongolia can be used as to detect viruses circulating in wildlife. These nucleic acid sources may represent an effective non-invasive resource for studying wildlife viral diversity and emerging viruses pre-emergence.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfano, Niccolo; Dayaram, Anisha; Axtner, Jan; Tsangaras, Kyriakos; Kampmann, Marie-Louise; Mohamed, Azlan; Wong, Seth T.; Gilbert, M.

Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are undertaken globally. Objectives: We summarised all currently registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved interventional studies. Data sources: The ClinicalTrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched. Study eligibility criteria: Registered clinical trials examining treatment and/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or study design restrictions were applied. Withdrawn, cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for COVID-19 were excluded. Participants and interventions: No restrictions in terms of participants\u0027 age and medical background or type of intervention were enforced. Methods: The registries were searched using the term \u0022coronavirus\u0022 or \u0022COVID-19\u0022 from their inception until 26th March 2020. Additional manual search of the registries was also performed. Eligible studies were summarised and tabulated. Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing Traditional Chinese Medicine. Results: In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing preventive strategies and 3 studies examining both were retrieved. Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomised (n=150, 76%) and open-label (n=73, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (IQR 40-200). Major categories of interventions that are currently being investigated are discussed. Conclusion: Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Summarised data on these trials will assist physicians and researchers to promote patient care and guide future research efforts for COVID-19 pandemic containment.

US-based descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have, for the most part, focused on patient populations with severe disease, captured in areas with limited testing capacity. The objective of this study is to compare characteristics of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients, in a population primarily comprised of mild and moderate infections, identified from comprehensive population-level testing. Here, we extracted demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs from 20,088 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics, in Salt Lake County, Utah; and for a subset of tested patients, we performed manual chart review to examine symptoms and exposure risks. To determine risk factors for testing positive, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of testing positive, adjusting for symptoms and prior exposure. Of the 20,088 individuals, 1,229 (6.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found that Non-White persons were more likely to test positive compared to non-Hispanic Whites (adjOR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.6), and that this increased risk is more pronounced among Hispanic or Latino persons (adjOR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.1). However, we did not find differences in the duration of symptoms nor type of symptom presentation between non-Hispanic White and non-White individuals. We found that risk of hospitalization increases with age (adjOR=6.9 95% CI: 2.1, 22.5 for age 60\u002B compared to 0-19), and additionally show that younger individuals (aged 0-19), were underrepresented both in overall rates of testing as well as rates of testing positive. We did not find major race/ethnic differences in hospitalization rates. In this analysis of predominantly non-hospitalized individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, enabled by expansive testing capacity, we found disparities in both testing and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by race/ethnicity and by age. Further work on addressing racial and ethnic disparities, particularly among Hispanic/Latino communities (where SARS-CoV-2 may be spreading more rapidly due to increased exposure and comparatively reduced testing), will be needed to effectively combat COVID-19 in the US.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, S.

This is due to the fact that the current co-culture strategy is highly time consuming and requires working in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this work, we present a new strategy based on high content screening automated microscopy (HCS) allowing large scale isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples in 1 week. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 tested negative, were processed with our HCS procedure and were compared to the classical isolation procedure. Isolation rate was 43 % with both strategies on RT-PCR positive samples, and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, where we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with HCS strategy, where 80 % of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, as compared to only 25 % with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive elements after 1 week of co-culture.

Finally, we construct a time-dependent budget allocation strategy and demonstrate its superiority over constant budget allocation on real networks following first acquaintance vaccination. Our results provide a principled approach to assess the needed vaccination rate given the social graph topology.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tennenholtz, Guy; Caramanis, Constantine; Mannor, Shie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea44a5e338dd5bd5b2ddc7241f6aba3319498817.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20060269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of individuals","sequential vaccination of individuals","constant budget allocation","acquaintance vaccination","needed vaccination rate","expected number of infected individuals","number of vaccinations","Effective allocation of vaccine","time-dependent budget allocation strategy","real networks","dynamics of infectious diseases spread","superiority","lower bounds","d-dimensional grids","social graph topology","principled approach","Erd\u0151s R\u00E9nyi graphs","critical role","methods","trees","effects","risk","estimates","limit","future pandemic","results","ways","containment","day"],"language":"en"},

Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: General population in Mexico. Participants: 561 subjects were recruited (71% female, mean age of was 30.7 {\u002B/-} 10.6 years). Interventions: An online survey to assess personal attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19, sleep-disorders related, the Mexican version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was applied. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Prevalence of anxiety, depression, internet addiction and sleep disorders and associated factors. Also, prevalence for anxiety and depression were compared to an historic control group. Results: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence for anxiety and depression was 50% (95% CI, 45.6% to 54.1%) and 27.6%, (95% CI 23.8% to 31.4%), respectively. We found a 51% (33% to 50%) increase in anxiety and up to 86% increase in depression uring the initial weeks of the lock-down compared to the control group. According to the IAT questionnaire, 62.7% (95% CI 58.6% to 68.8%) of our population had some degree of internet addiction. Odds ratio for development of anxiety symptoms was 2.02 (95% CI1.56-2.1, p=0.0001) and for depression was 2.15 (95% CI 1.59-2.9, p=0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, younger age (p=0.006), sleep problems (p=0.000), and internet addiction ( p=0.000) were associated with anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information on the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Mexican population. As in other parts of the globe, in Mexico, fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection has had devastating consequences on mental health, such as anxiety, depression and sleeping disturbances. Internet abuse and the consequent overexposure to rapidly spreading misinformation (infodemia) are associated to anxiety and depression.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Priego, B.

In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1,5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre- and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopez, Leonardo R; Rodo, Xavier","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/036460509b0fcfd086ddff5ec668663442eac341.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR","CCAA"],"locations":["China","Europe","Spain","Madrid"],"keyphrases":["epidemics","data","efficacy of containment","drastic reduction","substantial reduction","evolution similar","infected population","hard containment scenario","countries","situation of Italy","future evolution","times","isolation","peak","effects of varying proportions of containment","efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions","scenario projections","spread of infection","large uncertainties","Italy pre-","sub aggregated levels of CCAA","post-interventions","percent increase","worrying situation","spread of SARS","similar approach","clinical cases","update of results","number of deaths","different levels of progression","effects of intervention actions","ongoing partial confinement measures","modified SEIR compartmental model accounting","later Spain","pandemic","CoV","great concern","China","better prospects","individual regions","case reporting","order","simulations","mitigation","burden","addition","day of delay","dramatic differences","attack strategies","Madrid","Catalonia","latent period","Dynamics","maximum","quarantined populations","alpha values","Europe","Updates"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about human behavior while facing emergencies has become more significant nowadays. This knowledge can help improving our already present defensive responses and natural coping mechanisms when facing imminent dangers, natural disasters, and catastrophes. A new method is here offered to explore the core points of this topic. The Emergency Reaction Questionnaire (ERQ), is proposed for predicting one\u0027s reaction and behaviour in an emergency. First, a large item pool was created based on interviews with people facing emergencies on a weekly basis and related literature. The factor structure, reliability and validity were assessed on a large sample of lay people (N = 1115, 440 males) and specific groups of firefighters and people doing extreme sports (N = 85, all males). Participants were Caucasian with an age range of 18\u201370. We also used measures of anxiety, depression, and sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition and activation and coping in stressful situations. The ERQ was proved to be reliable and consistent in time and having sound psychometric properties both on the community and special samples. Results show that psychometric properties are satisfying; the test has excellent validity ratings. Consequently, the ERQ can be used in future research effectively and facilitate a better understanding of how people react in a highly dangerous situation. Future directions in the utilization of the new method are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zsido, Andras N.; Csokasi, Krisztina; Vincze, Orsolya; Coelho, Carlos M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2457398d35ef461d0044cddfacfa91be73d336ea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420920300510; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420920300510?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergencies","ERQ","large sample of lay people","males","Knowledge","new method","natural coping mechanisms","sound psychometric properties","Emergency Reaction Questionnaire","natural disasters","future research","Future directions","excellent validity ratings","large item pool","imminent dangers","present defensive responses","specific groups of firefighters","activation","sensation","community","time","test","weekly basis","extreme sports","depression","behavioral inhibition","utilization","interviews","related literature","better understanding","Participants","Caucasian","age range","factor structure","reliability","catastrophes","human behavior","measures of anxiety","stressful situations","special samples","core points","topic","behaviour","Results","dangerous situation","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective cohort study of 93 patients who were admitted to medical ward with a PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID 19 and met the inclusion criteria in a tertiary hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. There were three interventional subgroups (group A (n=45): who received antimalarial drug only classified as (A1), combined with azithromycin (A2) or combined with antiviral drugs (A3)), and one supportive care group (group B) (n=48). The primary and secondary endpoints of the study were achieving negative SARS_CoV_2 nasopharyngeal PCR sample within five days or less from the start of the intervention and 12 days or less from the diagnose, respectively.

This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the \u0022known immunological benefits\u0022 of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation. One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection). Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirov, STEFAN","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34694791cd158e785ad16404d5d34ad8559792c0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055616","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCG vaccination","mandatory vaccination","infection rates","mortality rates","rates of infections","study","rates of certain chronic diseases","population age","different income levels","potential confounding factors","differences","studies","connection","significant confounding factor","different groups","biological mechanism","preprint publications","number of publications","solid biology mechanism","community spread start date","major public policy decisions","time","ethnicity","countries\u0027 policies","view","hand","respect","causal link","association","morbidity","booster shot","immunological benefits","clinical trials","COVID19 context","vs","authors","correlation","headlines","follow","narrative","practice","observation","serious challenge","press","place"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE To determine the association of the extent of lung disease or coronary artery chest computed tomography (HRCT) variables, the Agatston coronary calcium score (CCS) and peri-coronary adipose tissue attenuation (PCAT), representing CAD and coronary inflammation, with mortality in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Single academic institution, Parma University Hospital, Italy, between March 5, 2020 and March 15, 2020. Final follow-up: March 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS 500 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent HRCT as a gatekeeper were initially selected and the subgroup with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection formed the final study group. EXPOSURES SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality was the end point. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and HRCT data were collected from hospital electronic records, and HRCT features (CCS and PCAT) were measured post-hoc from HRCT images. RESULTS Among 500 patients with suspected COVID-19, 279 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and formed the study group. Among them, 170 patients (61%) were discharged alive and 109 (39%) died. Comparing patients discharged alive with patients who died, the median age was 65 vs 77 (p\u003C0.001), with males 56% vs 68% (p=0.061), prior cardiovascular disease 9% vs 24% (p=0.001), median D-dimer 723 vs 1083 ng/ml (p\u003C0.001), median C-reactive protein 78 vs 148 mg/L (p\u003C0.001), the mean CCS 17 vs 189 (p\u003C0.001) and the median PCAT -76.4 HU vs -68.6 HU (p\u003C0.001). In multivariable analysis, only age (p\u003C0.001), D-dimer (p=0.041), C-reactive protein (p=0.002), extent of lung disease (p=0.002), and PCAT (p\u003C0.001), remained associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increased age, D-dimer, C-reactive protein and the HRCT image features of extent of lung disease and coronary inflammation by PCAT (but not the CCS) were independently associated with mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our study suggests that higher mortality in COVID-19 may be at least partly mediated by coronary artery inflammation.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaibazzi, N.; Martini, C.; Mattioli, M.; Tuttolomondo, D.; Guidorossi, A.; Suma, S.; Dey, D.; Palumbo, A.; De Filippo, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9209355df61d976fbf9bd29d1ec12b0153690491.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20087114v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["HU"],"organizations":["Parma University Hospital","HRCT","CCS","PCAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronary inflammation","coronary artery inflammation","pre-existing coronary artery disease","median PCAT","HU vs","suspected COVID","HRCT features","extent of lung disease","hospitalized COVID","consecutive patients","hospital mortality rate","HRCT data","coronavirus disease","HRCT images","higher mortality","median age","median D-dimer","median C-reactive protein","HRCT image features of extent","hospital death","laboratory","coronary artery chest computed tomography","Agatston coronary calcium score","prior cardiovascular disease","mean CCS","peri-coronary adipose tissue attenuation","Parma University Hospital","hospital electronic records","final study group","infection","RELEVANCE Increased age","EXPOSURES SARS-CoV","Final follow-up","case of myocardial injury","DESIGN Retrospective case series","variables","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","Single academic institution","assay of nasopharyngeal swabs","Italy","CONCLUSIONS","MEASURES","association","PARTICIPANTS","MAIN OUTCOMES","underlying mechanism","subgroup","Demographic","end point","IMPORTANCE","multivariable analysis","RESULTS","gatekeeper","males","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this paper is to study whether the novel coronavirus has also been associated with an increase in deaths in England and Wales for those who have not contracted the disease. Reasons behind this may include avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths that did not involve covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a differences-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in non-covid-19 deaths during the pandemic, compared to a control. As an additional approach, an interrupted time series model was also used. Results: Results suggest that there were an additional 531 non-covid-19 deaths in England and Wales since the outbreak of the pandemic, compared to what would have otherwise been expected [diff-in-diff interaction coeff: 531.11; 95%CI: 125.65 to 936.57]. This is confirmed by the interrupted time series model. Discussion: The health effects of covid-19 do not seem to be limited only to patients suffering from the disease, as the number of deaths for those who did not contract covid-19 has also demonstrated an absolute and relative increase. Analysing the cause of death for non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vandoros, Sotiris","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e560be892dd074ed83f0d979d605e3b5a730a2f5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.14.20065706v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","ONS"],"locations":["England","Wales"],"keyphrases":["number of deaths","non-covid","health effects of covid","relative increase","pandemic","additional approach","England","interrupted time series model","Wales","lives","study","Reasons","Results","disease","differences econometric approach","diff interaction","weekly ONS data","light","appropriate policy responses","cause of death","Methods","hospitals","GPs","visits","spikes","Discussion","outbreak","paper","trends","Background","novel coronavirus","objective","patients","UK","lockdown","control","period","CI"],"language":"en"},

This coding strategy may offer new opportunities for transmitting information to the brain using various sensory neural prostheses and brain-machine interfaces. However, it was not known whether the same coding mechanisms apply when electrical, rather than mechanical, stimulation is used. Here, we demonstrate that the predictions of the burst gap coding model for frequency perception apply to burst stimuli delivered with electrical pulses, re-emphasising the importance of the temporal structure of spike patterns in neural processing and perception of tactile stimuli. Reciprocally, the electrical stimulation data confirm that the results observed with mechanical stimulation do indeed depend on neural processing mechanisms in the central nervous system and are not due to mechanical effects in the skin or afferent population activation patterns. Our results suggest that spike intervals contribute to perceived frequency with perceptual weights that depend on their duration, and that a generalised frequency processing system would explain the constancy of vibrotactile frequency perception across different receptor types.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Kevin K.

Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. Methods We retrospectively studied the relationship between RDW and COVID19 mortality risk for 1198 adult patients diagnosed with SARS COV2 at 4 Partners Healthcare Network Hospitals between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Findings Elevated RDW (\u003E 14.5%) was associated with increased mortality in patients of all ages with a risk ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8). Stratified by age, the risk ratio was 6.2 (4.4-7.9, N = 312) \u003C 50 years, 3.2 (2.5-4.1, N = 230) 50-60, 2.3 (1.6-3.1, N = 236) 60-70, 1.2 (0.7-1.8, N = 203) 70-80, and 1.9 (1.5-2.3, N = 216) \u003E 80 years. RDW was significantly associated with mortality in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-Dimer, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities (p \u003C 1e-4 for RDW in all cases). Patients whose RDW increased during admission had a ~3-fold elevation in mortality risk compared to those whose RDW did not change.

Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars towards achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day^2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay) and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at http://www.theguarani.com.br/covid-19 or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 853,200 cases reported worldwide as of April 2nd 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within few days, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Utsunomiya, Yuri Tani; Utsunomiya, Adam Taiti Harth; Torrecilha, Rafaela Beatriz Pintor; Paulan, Silvana Cassia; Milanesi, Marco; Garcia, Jose Fernando","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d0bb3af5f5665e4b529c7307b56ea40202ebc5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047688","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hidden Markov Model","European Center for Disease Prevention and Control"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["growth behavior","stationary growth","growth dynamics","rapid growth","linear growth","constant growth","growth rate","growth decay","different growth stages","cases","monitoring growth acceleration curves","prevalence of COVID","evolution of COVID","proposed framework","simple framework","local behavior of COVID","analysis of prevalence","deceleration","weeks","Results","pandemic","human mobility","Disease Prevention","different permutations","arbitrary territory data","recent human history","detectable decline","technique","state","region","city","effective measure","MR","mass social isolation","Control","European Center","days","impact of public health measures","dissemination of SARS","prominent challenges","Restriction","asset","Moving Regression","ECDC","country","combinations","Hidden Markov Model","outbreak","R Shiny application","pillars","Conclusions","Countries","goal","Methods","flexibility","Background","Objective"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on analyses of available data, we deduced that the excessive prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) accumulation mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was the key pathological basis of COVID-19. Methods: The urine PGE2 levels were measured by mass spectrometry. An experimental study about Celebrex to treat COVID-19 was conducted based on routine treatment. A total of 44 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled (Experimental group n=37, Control group n=7). Patients in experimental group were given Celebrex once or twice a day (0.2 g/time) for 7-14 days. The dosage or duration was modified for individuals. Clinical outcomes of Celebrex adjuvant therapy were evaluated by vital signs, laboratory tests, and computed tomography upon the discontinuance of Celebrex. Results: We found that the concentrations of PGE2 in urine samples of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than that of healthy individuals (mean value is 170 ng/ml vs 18.8 ng/ml, p\u003C0.01) and positively correlated with the progression of COVID-19. Among the experimental group (ordinary n=29, severe n=7, critical n=1), 25 cases were treated with full dose and 11 cases with half dose of Celebrex, and 1 case with Ibuprofen. The remission rate were 100%, 82% and 57% in full dose, half dose and control group respectively. Celebrex significantly reduced the PGE2 levels and promoted recovery of ordinary or severe COVID-19.

The first is a data driven approach for predicting the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM-SAE network, which are somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered features representing a country\u0027s response to the early spread of the pandemic. A Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with Sao Paulo leading with almost 65 thousand estimated, confirmed cases.

Methods: Here, in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data with the goals of identifying the high risk areas of disease spread and assessing the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. We compared the impact of intracity vs. intercity travel restrictions on both the total number of infections and the speed of outbreak spread and developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions. Findings: We found that intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on overall infection numbers than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. We also identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. Interpretation: In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook\u0027s aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. Both intracity and intercity movement affect outbreak dynamics, with the former having more of an impact on the total numbers of cases and the latter impacting geographic scope.

The protein and nucleotide sequences of ACE2 were initially compared across different species to identify key differences among them. The ACE2 receptor of various species was homology modelled and assessed for its binding ability to the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Out of the several spike binding properties of ACE2, a significant difference between the known, infected and uninfected species was observed for Entropy side chain, Van der Waals, Solvation Polar, Solvation Hydrophobic and Interface Residues. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the animals into infected or uninfected, for all the Orders (of animals). This clearly established the fact that no single parameter should be used to predict SARS-CoV-2 entry. The logistic regression model constructed led to inclusion of Interaction energy, entropy sidechain and entropy mainchain for estimating the probability of viral entry in different species. In the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates showed high probability of viral entry. However, among the primates, baboons have very low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a very low probability.

In the absence of high-quality evidence, understandably the recommendations from various organizations are cautious. Several randomized controlled trials are underway but shall take time to conclude. We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to ascertain the role of CS in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane library and Embase, were searched, using the keywords of interest and the PICO search technique, from inception to 12th April 2020. Study Selection: Studies highlighting the use of CS in coronavirus infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19 were selected based on pre-determined inclusion criteria. Data extraction: Data was extracted into an excel sheet and transferred to comprehensive meta-analysis software version 3, Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA, for analysis. Data synthesis: Five studies with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the meta-analysis. The rate ratio (RR) for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.26 (95% CI: 0.96-1.65, I2: 74.46), indicating lack of benefit of CS therapy on mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The RR for mortality on analysis of the three studies that particularly reported on patients with significant pulmonary compromise secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was neutral (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.63-1.33, I2: 63.38). Conclusions: The use of CS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 did not improve or worsen mortality. Pending further information from controlled studies, CS can be used in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency and moderate to severe ARDS without the risk of increased mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gangopadhyay, Kalyan Kumar; Mukherjee, Jagat J; Sinha, Binayak; GHOSAL, SAMIT","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069773v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CS","Biostat Inc.","RR","ARDS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["COVID","ill patients","use of CS","role of CS","controlled studies","CS therapy","SARS-CoV","coronavirus infection","RR","Data Sources","Data synthesis","Data extraction","risk of increased mortality","comprehensive meta-analysis software version","I2","severe acute respiratory syndrome","randomized controlled trials","severe ARDS","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","coronavirus disease","role of systemic corticosteroids","Pubmed","corticosteroid insufficiency","Biostat","significant pulmonary compromise secondary","Electronic databases","critical illness","recommendations","MERS","management","Cochrane library","Englewood","NJ","lack of benefit","sheet","PICO search technique","various organizations","pre-determined inclusion criteria","absence of high-quality evidence","inception","Embase","USA","Study Selection","rate ratio","information","keywords","time","Conclusions","Objective"],"language":"en"},

This study suggests that it is important to consider memory of prior catastrophic events as they will influence the public response to emerging threats.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Haohui; Xu, Weipan; Paris, Cecile; Reeson, Andrew; Li, Xun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/735fb3fef466e1bbbd70d798611ab467e750b212.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033688","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["durable public awareness","spread of public awareness","public response","study","comparable cities","outbreak","available online search data","China","greater migration ties","novel coronavirus","epicentre","Wuhan","memory of prior catastrophic events","SARS","days","COVID","emerging threats","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

We now report that patients with COVID-19 (n=96) have markedly elevated levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in their blood.

Currently, there is limited clarity on the pharmacological treatments available for the novel coronavirus. We systematically identified the current evidence and ongoing research on the pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA-ScR. Observational studies, including cohort studies and case series, as well as experimental studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were searched electronically on April 7, 2020 and by hand on May 1, 2020. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were searched along with seven trial registries. The inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received pharmacological therapies, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and favipiravir. Results: We identified 222 studies on pharmacological treatment of the novel coronavirus. We included 11 of these studies in this review, including the ones on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (one cohort), lopinavir/ritonavir (one RCT, three cohorts, and two case series), remdesivir (one RCT and one case series), tocilizumab (one case series), and favipiravir (one RCT). In the three RCTs carried out in China, both lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir did not show any significant earlier clinical improvement in case of severe infection [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.31, p=0.09 and HR: 1.24, p=0.24, respectively], The clinical recovery rate on day seven was not significantly different between the favipiravir and arbidol groups (p=0.14) for moderate patients, although the duration of pyrexia and cough in the favipiravir group was significantly shorter as compared to the arbidol group (p\u003C0.01). There are 135 ongoing RCTs, including 72 for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, 29 for lopinavir/ritonavir, 14 for remdesivir, 16 for tocilizumab, and 4 for favipiravir. Conclusion: The clinical effectiveness and safety of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear owing to the lack of large, high-quality RCTs. However, in the event of emerging infectious diseases, we need to repeatedly and systematically update the best available evidence to avoid misleading information.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamaji, N.; Ohde, S.; Kobayashi-Cuya, K.

Comparing CoViD-19 trends over time and place may thus provide important public health insights about the impact of different strategies. To aid these comparisons, we illustrate the properties of three comparative indicators of CoViD-19 mortality using estimates and projections for the world most affected areas. We first demonstrate how a Crude CoViD-19 Death Rate (CCDR) incorporates the temporal dimension of CoViD-19 mortality. We also show how the advantage of the indirectly age-standardized Comparative CoViD-19 Mortality Ratio (CCMR). Finally, we calculate declines in life expectancy at birth that translate CoViD-19 mortality projections into an easily interpretable metric. Projections used to illustrate this yields a .3 of a year decline in life expectancy at birth for the U.S.A., for instance, which would be comparable to the decline in life expectancy at birth between 1992 and 1993 (AIDS mortality) and between 2014 and 2017 (opioid-overdose mortality). Data about the pandemic are changing too rapidly to draw any conclusion from the current values of the indicators, however, and there are multiple reasons to expect upward revisions of these projections.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heuveline, P.; Tzen, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec848f3316caaf1f7ff8d8416b1a18131301a990.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.29.20085506v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality projections","Crude CoViD","comparative indicators of CoViD","Mortality Ratio","AIDS mortality","birth","temporal dimension of CoViD","life expectancy","age-standardized Comparative CoViD","opioid-overdose mortality","pandemic","public-health orders","important public health insights","year decline","novel coronavirus disease","local institutions","place","CCDR","Death Rate","impact of different strategies","upward revisions","world","time","properties","estimates","multiple reasons","current values","response","affected areas","spread","trends","interpretable metric","declines","CCMR","conclusion","advantage","instance","comparisons","Data"],"language":"en"},

In order to identify the evolutionary relationship of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the detection efficiency of primers that are currently used in different countries, we retrieved genomic sequences of 373 SARS-CoV-2 strains from multiple databases and performed genome-wide variation analysis. According to the nucleotide C28144T variation, the SARS-CoV-2 can be divided into group A (117 strains) and group B (256 strains). The spike protein gene (S gene) coding region 1841 (total 23403) A1841G, formed a B1 subgroup (40 strains) in group B, of which 30 strains were from European and American countries in March (especially Washington, USA). These mutations are likely to be influenced by the environment or the immunization selection pressure of different populations. Although the mutation is not in the receptor binding region (RBD) and alkaline cleavage region, it may also affect the ability of transmission and pathogenicity; however, the significance is not yet clear. As the ratio of A / B strains in the epidemic months showed an increasing trend (0.35: 1 in January, 0.62: 1 in February and 0.76: 1 in March), it seems that the transmissibility of group A strains becomes stronger with time. Based on the variation of 11 nucleotide sites during the epidemic process, it is speculated that the Washington strain is more like an ancestor type, and the Wuhan strain is the offspring of the group A virus strain. By comparing the detection capabilities of primers in different countries, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide variation may only affect molecular detection of very few strains. The differences in the transmissibility, pathogenicity and clinical manifestations of different types of strains require further investigations.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, L.; wang, s.; Ren, Q.; Yang, J.; Lu, Y.; Gai, Z.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9c99dfb15559bebe90991e2a51ccd91eb503c91.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081349v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Washington"],"keyphrases":["B strains","SARS-CoV","group B","different countries","nucleotide variation","transmissibility of group","clinical manifestations of different types of strains","molecular detection","nucleotide C28144T variation","Washington strain","evolutionary relationship of SARS","detection capabilities of primers","detection efficiency of primers","coding region","pathogenicity","epidemic months","American countries","epidemic process","nucleotide sites","Wuhan strain","virus strain","effect of mutation","issues of mutation","genome-wide variation analysis","receptor binding region","alkaline cleavage region","immunization selection pressure of different populations","S gene","spike protein gene","epidemic evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","RBD","multiple databases","offspring","genomic sequences","ancestor type","environment","A1841G","B1 subgroup","origin","increasing trend","investigations","time","order","significance","ability of transmission","differences","ratio","mutations","USA"],"language":"en"},

To cross-validate general attitudes with attitudes towards specific instances of AI applications, summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles. These were rated for comfortableness and perceived capability. Comfortableness with specific applications was a strong predictor of general attitudes as measured by the GAAIS, but perceived capability was a weaker predictor.

Methods An online survey-based study was conducted during the month of March among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers) were used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied by using SPSS version 21. Results Of 414 participants, 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105) nurses.

The vast and rapid spread of COVID-19 calls for immediate action from policy-makers and in many countries, various lockdown measures were implemented. Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyse the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,003,298 surveys were filled out to date. We used a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Ratio (SR), defined as a weighted mean of symptoms found to be prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15 and April 22, the mean SR sharply declined by 78.9%, as did every individual symptom, including our most common symptoms of cough and rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, which decreased from 14.5% and 13.8% of the survey responders, respectively, to 2.4% and 2.5%. We also observed reduction in symptoms separately in the vast majority of cities in Israel. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keshet, A.; Gavrieli, A.; Rossman, H.; Shilo, S.; Meir, T.; Karady, T.; Lavon, A.; Kolobkov, D.; Kalka, I.; Shoer, S.; Godneva, A.; Cohen, O.; Zohar, A.

However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suo, Tao; Liu, Xinjin; Guo, Ming; Feng, Jiangpeng; Hu, Wenjia; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Qiuhan; Wang, Xin; Sajid, Muhanmmad; Guo, Dong; Huang, Zhixiang; Deng, Liping; Chen, Tielong; Liu, Fang; Xu, Ke; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Qi; Liu, Yingle; Xiong, Yong; Guo, Guozhong; Chen, Yu; Lan, Ke","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029439","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical RT-PCR detection","ddPCR detection","current standard RT-PCR","Real-Time PCR","clinical detection of SARS","limitation of RT","optimized ddPCR","clinical pharyngeal swab samples","overall accuracy of ddPCR","feasibility of droplet digital PCR","current clinical practice","lower limit of detection","negative pharyngeal swab samples","SARS-CoV","negative nucleic acid test","supposed convalescents","significant numbers of false negative reports","times lower","gold standard","false negatives","patient throat","superiority","low viral load","powerful complement","suspected patients","diagnosis","terms","fever","Results","sensitivity","Conclusions","Background","weeks","experiment","Methods","investigation","addition","treatment"],"language":"en"},

As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant misinformation about the virus leading to collateral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The paper is not so much about the model itself - because there are many good scientific approaches to model an epidemic - as it is about crunching numbers when there are barely any numbers to crunch. The coronavirus outbreak in USA is used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and testing efficiency as variables. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odendaal, Willem G","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034512","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan, Hubei Province"],"locations":["China","Monte Carlo"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus outbreak","China","engineering approach","spread","modeling approach","USA","numbers","Monte Carlo approach","World governments","novel coronavirus","infectious agent","new infectious disease","infected countries","incubation period","imposing early travel restrictions","rampant misinformation","testing efficiency","variables","COVID","collateral disasters","Wuhan","sparse data","Hubei Province","good scientific approaches","epidemic","transmission","implementation","SARS-CoV","financial markets","better models","acceptable accuracy","emergence","surprise","days","paper"],"language":"en"},

Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza.

Abstract So far, available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at greater risk for COVID-19 infection. In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless patients become infected with COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20 mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with COVID-19. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Le\u00F3n-Rend\u00F3n, JL; Hurtado-Salazar, C.; Yamamoto-Furusho, JK","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e54b576dd53254615ac56211e2421646cbc3b3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0375090620300549; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375090620300549?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["necrosis tumoral alfa"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["in patients with","including COVID","datos de COVID","should also be avoided","the risk for infection and should be continued","unless patients become infected with COVID","if patients become infected with COVID","type of biologic therapy should be","with steroids and","patients with IBD remission","biologic treatment with anti","agentes anti","ASA dose should be optimized in cases of","the oral and","integrins or anti","The drugs can be restarted","Regarding patients with IBD activity","The combined","Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild","such as anti","Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible","the risk for infections","any type of infection","riesgo de infecci\u00F3n","not at greater risk for COVID","or topical","the infectious process","TNF alfa","EII","pacientes","tipo de infecci\u00F3n","suspend them or lower the dose","uso de esteroides sist\u00E9micos","and methotrexate","or tumor necrosis factor","available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel","In regard","dosis mayores","alpha agents or any other mechanism of action","uso de budesonida MMX","SARS","uso combinado","tiopurinas","mayor riesgo","riesgo de infecciones","factor de necrosis tumoral alfa","doses above","administraci\u00F3n oral","Immunomodulating drugs","caso de reca\u00EDda","those combinations can","without modifying doses","casos de actividad leve","avoid systemic steroid","tipo de terapia biol\u00F3gica","which could","per day have an immunosuppressive effect","susceptibility","interleukins","contra","far","need","moderada","integrinas","relapse","evidencia disponible","Abstract","relaci\u00F3n","d\u00EDa","t\u00F3pica","enfermedad","f\u00E1rmacos inmunomoduladores","metotrexato","tratamiento biol\u00F3gico","mecanismo de acci\u00F3n","medida","interleucinas","Finally","Resumen","momento","There","susceptibilidad","ASAs","efecto inmunosupresor","remisi\u00F3n","aminosalicilatos","necesidad","proceso infeccioso"],"language":"es"},

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells.

We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially-determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. Methods We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. Results Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths, and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. Conclusion Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to build back better.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCartney, G.; Leyland, A.; Walsh, D.; Dundas, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20090761v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["years of life expectancy","years of inequality","years of suicide deaths","unmitigated COVID","years of drug poisoning deaths","modelled mortality impact of COVID","greater negative life expectancy contribution","estimates of mortality","mortality attributable","Results Mortality","mitigating COVID","UK","equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide","age-standardised mortality rates","socioeconomic inequality-related deaths","negative impact","infectious disease model of COVID","post-pandemic economic policies","terms of crude death counts","opportunity","long-term population health improvements","order","governments","scale","Methods","loss","constituent nations","public","Conclusion","mitigated scenario","pandemics"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature \u226537.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car.

In the absence of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, well-targeted social distancing measures are essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing strain on local health systems, and preventing mortality. Here, we provide a quantitative assessment of the efficacy of social distancing to slow COVID-19 transmission and reduce hospital surge, depending on the timing and extent of the measures imposed for a metropolitan region and its health care systems. We built a granular mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission that incorporated age-specific and risk-stratified heterogeneity, estimates for the transmission, and severity of COVID-19 using current best evidence. We performed thousands of stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Area to project the impact of school closures coupled with social distancing measures that were estimated to reduce non-household contacts by 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 90%. We compare early versus late implementation and estimate the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU patients, ventilator needs and deaths through mid-August, 2020. We queried local emergency services and hospital systems to estimate total hospital bed, ICU, and ventilator capacity for the region. We expected COVID-19 hospital beds and ICU requirements would surpass local capacity by mid-May if no intervention was taken. Assuming a four-day epidemic doubling time, school closures alone would be expected to reduce peak hospitalizations by only 18% and cumulative deaths by less than 3%. Immediate social distancing measures that reduced non-household contacts by over 75%, such as stay-at-home orders and closing of non-essential businesses, would be required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity. Peak ICU bed demand prior to mid August 2020 would be expected to be reduced from 2,121 (95% CI: 2,018-2,208) with no intervention to 698 (95% CI: 204-1,100) with 75% social distancing and 136 (95% CI: 38-308) with 90% social distancing; current ICU bed capacity was estimated at 680. A two-week delay in implementation of such measures is projected to accelerate a local ICU bed shortage by four weeks. School closures alone hardly impact the epidemic curve. Immediate social distancing measures that reduce non-household contacts by over 75% were required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity.

Design Comparative analysis of international standards for filtering respirators and rapid review of their performance and impact in healthcare. Data sources Websites of international standards organisations, Medline and EMBASE (final search 11th May 2020), with hand-searching of references and citations. Study selection Guided by the SPIDER tool, we included studies whose sample was healthcare workers (including students). The phenomenon of interest was respirators, including disposable and reusable types. Study designs including cross-sectional, observational cohort, simulation, interview and focus group. Evaluation approaches included test of respirator performance, test of clinician performance or adherence, self-reported comfort and impact, and perceptions of use. Research types included quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. We excluded studies comparing the effectiveness of respirators with other forms of protective equipment. Data extraction, analysis and synthesis Two reviewers extracted data using a template. Suitability for inclusion in the analysis was judged by two reviewers. We synthesised standards by tabulating data according to key criteria. For the empirical studies, we coded data thematically followed by narrative synthesis. Results We included relevant standards from 8 authorities across Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australasia. 39 research studies met our inclusion criteria. There were no instances of comparable publications suitable for quantitative comparison. There were four main findings. First, international standards for respirators apply across workplace settings and are broadly comparable across jurisdictions. Second, effective and safe respirator use depends on proper fitting and fit-testing. Third, all respirator types carry a burden to the user of discomfort and interference with communication which may limit their safe use over long periods; studies suggest that they have little impact on specific clinical skills in the short term but there is limited evidence on the impact of prolonged wearing. Finally, some clinical activities, particularly chest compressions, reduce the performance of filtering facepiece respirators. Conclusion A wide range of respirator types and models is available for use in patient care during respiratory pandemics. Careful consideration of performance and impact of respirators is needed to maximise protection of healthcare workers and minimise disruption to the delivery of care.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burton, C.; Coles, B.; Anisesh, A.; Smith, S.; Toomey, E.; Chan, X.

Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression.

Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes.

It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p \u003C0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nasiri, Mohammad Javad; Haddadi, Sara; Tahvildari, Azin; Farsi, Yeganeh; Arbabi, Mahta; Hasanzadeh, Saba; Jamshidi, Parnian; Murthi, Mukunthan; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f69509401b6d8e8593023f01b4d41edfc2de1d0c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","IC; Stata Corporation","USA"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["higher mortality","mortality findings","laboratory findings","higher risk of mortality","common findings","Pooled mortality rate","laboratory abnormalities","Fever","COVID19","Observational studies","Cardiovascular disease","China","females","common symptoms","comprehensive systematic review","better understanding of COVID","evolving coronavirus disease","significant publication bias","Stata Corporation","high CRP","substantial health","pooled frequency","common CT-Scan presentation","half of hospitalized patients","World Health Organization","progressive course of cough","College Station","elevated C-Reactive Protein","meta-analysis","TX","version","leukopenia","economic crisis","confidence intervals","mean age","Bilateral ground-glass opacities","different aspects","USA","pandemic","countries","Objectives","date","hypertension","myalgia","random effect model","Statistical analyses","Methods","scientific literature","prevalent comorbidities","years","city of Wuhan","total","inclusion criteria","fatigue","lymphopenia","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk balance for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 treatment. Methods: The overall benefit-risk of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments was assessed using the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. Results: Several potential key benefits and risks were identified for use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 treatment. For the benefit of virological clearance, three studies were identified. A significant risk difference (RD) between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group (standard of care) was found for only one study (RD=0.58, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.98). The risk difference was not significant for the other two studies (RD=-0.07, 95% CI:-0.75, 0.61 and RD=0.08, 95% CI:-0.74, 0.91). In addition, no significant risk difference between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group (standard of care) was identified for the risk of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) (RD=0.07, 95% CI: -0.28, 0.41). Conclusions: Overall, no conclusion can be made on the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments at this time. Whilst the availability of comparative data are limited, the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks. As further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available, this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing benefit-risk assessment.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osborne, V.; Davies, M.; Dhanda, S.; Roy, D.; Lane, S.; Evans, A.; Shakir, S.

Some emphasise social distancing, while others focus on other interventions. Evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions is urgently needed to guide public health policy and avoid unnecessary damage to the economy and other harms. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on epidemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness. Methods: MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 27, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to epidemic control. Reviews, randomized trials, observational studies, and modelling studies were included. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs). Findings: We found 1,653 papers; 34 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies suggested that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, only evidence from observational and modelling studies was available. A cautious interpretation of this body of lower-quality evidence suggests that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented). Conclusions: A cautious interpretation of this body of evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, swift contact tracing and case isolation, and protective equipment for healthcare workers is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juneau, Carl-Etienne; Pueyo, Toma; Bell, Matt; Gee, Genevieve; Potvin, Louise","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/946a77b52881f34fc2b69debf905839aca061819.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20054726v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cost-effective interventions","body of evidence","cost-effective options","cost-effective strategy","lower-quality evidence","Higher-quality evidence","combination of interventions","single interventions","modelling studies","observational studies","cost-effectiveness","swift contact tracing","social distancing measures","effectiveness of hand washing","case isolation","protective equipment","healthcare workers","face masks","school closures","randomized trials","body of lower","epidemic control","cautious interpretation","early vaccination","COVID","focus","surveillance networks","workplace","unnecessary damage","combinations","public health policy","response","home quarantines","stockpiling antivirals","Reviews","times","severe viruses","comprehensive summary","study designs","SARS-CoV","economy","range of terms","MEDLINE","week","Background","Countries","harms","pandemic","H1N1 influenza","Conclusions","Articles","Findings","papers","Methods","Embase","death"],"language":"en"},

As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections during its initial invasion of the US remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the US through March 12, we estimated that 22,876 (95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) infections occurred in the US by this date. By comparing the model\u0027s predictions of symptomatic infections to local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between February 21 and March 12, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.97, 95% PPI: 0.85 - 0.98) with increases in testing.

The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed L-RaG age and the related concept of Biological age, from the medical and gerontology literature. Practically speaking, in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity, the L-RaG age could be used for pension and retirement policy. In the language of behavioral finance and economics, a salient metric that adjusts chronological age for longevity risk might help capture the public\u2019s attention, educate them about lifetime uncertainty and induce many of them to take action \u2014 such as working longer and/or retiring later.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milevsky, Moshe A.","journal":"Insurance: Mathematics and Economics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/288e7ca4114dc7e51395a0defa211b9cf67297f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167668720300445; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668720300445","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RaG age","global age","chronological age","longevity-risk","longevity risk","paper","related concept of Biological age","RaG values","compensation laws of mortality","Human Mortality Database","Makeham mortality hazard rates","world of growing mortality heterogeneity","year-old Russian male","year-old Swedish male","inverting Gompertz","salient metric","country data","computational framework","economics","heterogeneous populations","language of behavioral finance","public\u2019s attention","pension","salience","possible applications","HMD","connection","lifetime uncertainty","gerontology literature","author","retirement policy","things","action"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Objective: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID \u002B units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevance, A;

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 has been reported; however, there are limited researches that investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the Middle East. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID19 in Saudi Arabia. METHODS This study is a retrospective single-centre case series study. We extracted data for patients who were admitted to the Al-Noor Specialist hospital with a PCR confirmed SARS-COV-2 between 12th and 31st of March 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patients characteristics. Continuous data were reported as mean (SD). Chi-squared test/Fisher test were used as appropriate to compare proportions for categorical variables. RESULTS A total of 150 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19 during the study period. The mean age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.3 years). Around 61.0% (n= 90) were males and six patients (3.9%) reported working in the healthcare sector. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (28.8%, n= 42) and diabetes mellitus (26.0%, n= 38). The majority of the patients, 64.4% (n = 96) had a recent contact history with a COVID patient. Regarding the severity of the hospitalised patients, 105 patients (70.0%) were mild, 29 (19.3%) were moderate, and 16 patients (10.7%) were severe or required ICU care. From the 105 mild patients, around 31.3% (n= 47) were asymptomatic.

The aim of this work is to estimate and predict the true number of COVID-19 (detected and undetected) infections in India for short to medium forecast horizons. In particular, using publicly available COVID-19 infection data upto 16th April 2020, we predict the true number of infections in India during and upto the end of the formal lockdown period (21st April 2020). Methods: The high death rate observed in most COVID-19 hit countries is suspected to be a function of the undetected infections existing in the population. An estimate of the age weighted infection fatality rate (IFR) of the disease of 0.41%, specifically calculated by taking into account the age structure of Indian population, is already available in the literature. In addition, the recorded case fatality rate (CFR= 0.70%) of Kerala, the only state in India to report single digit new infections over the second week of April, is used as a second estimate of the IFR. These estimates are used to formulate a relationship between deaths recorded and the true number of infections. The estimated undetected and detected cases time series based on these two IFR estimates are then used to fit a discrete time multivariate infection model to predict the total infections at the end of the formal lockdown period. Results: In two consecutive fortnights during the lockdown, it was noted that the rise in detected infections has decreased by 2.7 times. For an IFR of 0.41%, the rise in undetected infections decreased by 3.2 times and the predicted number of total infections in India is 3.14 lakhs. While for an IFR of 0.70%, the rise in undetected cases decreased by 3.3 times and the total number of infections predicted on 21st April is 1.75 lakhs. Interpretation and Conclusions: The behaviour of the undetected cases over time effectively illustrates the effects of lockdown and increased testing. From our estimates, it is found that the lockdown has brought down the undetected to detected cases ratio, and has consequently dampened the increase in the number of total cases. However, even though the rate of rise in total infections has fallen, the lifting of the lockdown should be done keeping in mind that 1.75 to 3 lakhs undetected cases will already exist in the population on 21st April.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukhopadhyay, Siuli; Chakraborty, Debraj","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072892v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFR"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["undetected infections","total number of infections","true number of infections","predicted number of total infections","number of total cases","lakhs undetected cases","number of detected COVID","extent of undetected COVID","true number of COVID","available COVID","detected cases time series","rate of rise","cases ratio","effects of lockdown","IFR estimates","single digit new infections","formal lockdown period","times","age weighted infection fatality rate","recorded case fatality rate","end","infection data upto","high death rate","lifting","discrete time multivariate infection model","age structure of Indian population","CFR","behaviour","understanding","medium forecast horizons","state","account","addition","pandemic","Methods","Kerala","consecutive fortnights","increased testing","Conclusions","relationship","week","deaths","Objectives","function","mind","effective tackling","hit countries","Results","Interpretation","guide","Background","disease","aim","work","literature"],"language":"en"},

Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample 32 cases [9]. In this paper we propose non-adaptive and adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [2] where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence we save 74% at 1% we save 91% and at 1% we save 97% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show the method is still efficient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low. Abstract In addition we recommend clinical screening to filter out individuals with symptoms and show this leaves us with a population with lower prevalence. Our approach is particularly applicable to vulnerable confined populations such as nursing homes, prisons, military ships and cruise ships.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mentus, Cassidy; Romeo, Martin; DiPaola, Christian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62ba0b30fde5442214814b6a38b27a0d324b0f9e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20050245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adaptive group testing strategies","entire group","largest group","Abstract Testing strategies","mixed sample","combined sample","individual testing","method","military ships","cruise ships","positive case","lower prevalence","number of times","number of people","generalized binary splitting","nursing homes","prisons","vulnerable confined populations","clinical screening","individuals","sensitivity","leaves","Covid","symptoms","approach","addition","GBS","paper","cases","RT-PCR","subgroups","tests"],"language":"en"},

To this end, we propose a control scheme that aims to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid diverse adverse effects. Exploiting the fact that the severity of the disease increases considerably with age, the proposed control scheme protects high-risk individuals that mainly consist of the elderly. The protection of high-risk individuals reduces the average severity of the disease in the unprotected population, thereby substantially reducing mortality and avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system. Social acceptability (in terms of the resulting mortality) and feasibility (in terms of the healthcare system capacity) of the proposed herd immunity strategy are summarized into two respective, easily computable conditions by building on a simple susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) model. For its parsimony, the proposed framework can provide a rule of thumb that applies to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the considered control scheme if R0 [\u2264] 2.0 and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akamatsu, T.; Nagae, T.; Osawa, M.; Satsukawa, K.; Sakai, T.; Mizutani, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33f4bf0e36badf5ec87786c07754ee47769e05b1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.19.20107524v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed herd immunity strategy","social acceptability","viability of herd immunity strategies","feasibility","proposed control scheme","coronavirus disease","social acceptance","considered control scheme","healthcare system capacity","proposed framework","terms","high mortality","resulting mortality","average severity","COVID","severity rates","protection of high-risk individuals","basic requirements","reported value","overall deaths","times smaller","viable policy option","rule of thumb","various populations","paper studies","computable conditions","unprotected population","seasonal influenza","R0","collapse","diverse adverse effects","SIR","parsimony","end","fact","Japan","model","elderly"],"language":"en"},

The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977). Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak.

However, little is known about its pathological mechanism, and there are still no clinical study reports on specific treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy on COVID-19. Methods In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, adult critical COVID-19 patients (including severe type and critical type, according to the clinical classification defined by National Health Commission of China) in 8 government designated treatment center in China from Dec 23, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, prognosis were extracted from electronic medical records, and IVIG was exposure factor. Primary outcomes were the 28 days and 60 days mortality, and secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Meanwhile, the parameters of inflammation response and organ function were detected. The risk factors were determined by COX proportional hazards model. The subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage and timing. Findings 325patients were included in this study, of whom 222 (68%) were severe type, 103 (32%) were critical type. 42 (13%) died in 28 days within hospitalization, total 54 (17%) died in 60 days, and 6 (3%) died in severe type, 48 (47%) died in critical type. 174 cases were used IVIG, and 151 cases were not. Compared with the baseline characteristics between two groups, the results showed that the patients in IVIG group had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHII) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, IL-6 and lactate level, lower lymphocyte count and oxygenation index (all P\u003C0.05). The 28 day and 60 day mortality did not improve with IVIG in overall patients. The in-hospital stay and the total duration of disease were longer in IVIG group (p\u003C0.001). Risk factors were clinical classification (hazards ratio 0.126, 95% confidence interval 0.039-0.413, P=0.001), and using IVIG (hazards ratio 0.252, 95% confidence interval 0.107-0.591, P=0.002) with COX regression. Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28 day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all p\u003C0.05), and 60-day mortality reduced significantly by using IVIG in the early stage (admission[\u2264]7 days) and with high dose (\u003E15 g/d). Interpretation Early and high dose of IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients only in critical type, which provides the clinical basis for the choice of treatment population and method of IVIG therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to examine the prevalence and associated risk factors for psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Methods: Amidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients. Results: 43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and/or depression symptoms. Conclusions: Psychological morbidities and chronic fatigue are common among COVID-19 patients.

Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible to those observed in the transcriptomic data. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient. For the casual Reader Just to make a few things clear: - RNA editing and DNA editing are PHYSIOLOGICAL processes. Organisms uses them to (a) try to fight viruses, (b) increase heterogeneity inside cells (on many levels), (c) recognise their own RNA. - our work suggests that: (a) cells use RNA editing in trying to deal with Coronaviruses. We don\u0027t know to what extent they succeed (and it would be nice if we could help them). (b) Whatever happens, mutations inserted by RNA editing fuel viral evolution.

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%\uFF0C68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Guanmin; Ren, Xiaoshuai; Liu, Yan; Chen, Hongtao; Liu, Wei; Guo, Zhaowang; Zhang, Yaqin; Chen, Chaoqun; Zhou, Jianhui; Xiao, Qiang; Shan, Hong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e046a06f262d74d025272ad697d358c4afb5d9bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive RT-PCR","RT-PCR tests","stool RT-PCR results","value of stool RT-PCR","Combination of RT","pharyngeal swab RT-PCR","performances of RT","chest CT","diagnosing COVID","consecutive positive stool","confirmed COVID","exclusion cases","negative pharyngeal swabs","SARS-CoV","efficient screening pattern","monitoring of SARS","highest sensitivity","scheme of screening","Coronavirus Disease","inconsistent results","optimal pattern","higher sensitivity","kappa-value","mild infections","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","discovery rate","item","diagnostic accuracy","records","demographics","time","hospital discharge","good agreement","global threat","public health","light","Background","patients","Findings","Interpretation","study","Methods","course"],"language":"en"}]}

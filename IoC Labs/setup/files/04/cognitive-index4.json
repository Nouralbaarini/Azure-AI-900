This powerful system is patterned with high-aspect ratio micropillars to enhance reporter probe binding.

With the presence of double-stranded DNA target, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and non-specifically cleaves the ssDNA reporters initially immobilized on the micropillars. This collateral cleavage releases fluorescence dyes into the assay, and the intensity is linearly proportional to the target DNA concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 nM. Importantly, this system does not rely on traditional dye-quencher labeled probe thus eliminating the fluorescence background presented in the assay. Furthermore, our one-step detection protocol is performed at isothermal conditions (37\u00B0C) without using complicated and time-consuming off-chip probe hybridization and denaturation. This miniaturized and fully packed IMPACT chip demonstrates rapid, sensitive, and simple nucleic acid detection and is an ideal candidate for the next generation molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care (POC) applications, responding to emerging and deadly pathogen outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hass, Kenneth N.; Bao, Mengdi; He, Qian; Park, Myeongkee; Qin, Peiwu; Du, Ke","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6794d6e21f1efc9c5b50b8d895871e9fb5717f07.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.994137","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRISPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral DNA detection","probe immobilization","enclosed system","powerful system","chip probe hybridization","CRISPR Cas12a","CRISPR enzyme","reporter probe binding","stranded DNA target","one-step detection protocol","target DNA concentration","assay","Integrated Micropillar Polydimethylsiloxane Accurate CRISPR Detection","simple nucleic acid detection","packed IMPACT chip","fluorescence background","high-aspect ratio micropillars","collateral cleavage releases fluorescence dyes","point","ideal candidate","generation molecular diagnostic platform","crRNA complex","isothermal conditions","surface modification","applications","POC","care","presence of double","traditional dye-quencher","deadly pathogen outbreaks","intensity","denaturation","ssDNA reporters","nM"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziff, Anna L.; Ziff, Robert M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33bd85ea9ca61c4d0674c43ae5b901b271b46f1e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023820","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["exponential growth","growth law","growth rate","current growth","exponential behavior","exponential decline","power-law behavior","power law similar","disease","power-law kinetics","non-China deaths","reproduction number","China statistics","terms of number","early behavior","rate equations","daily rate","pandemic","classic epidemiological approach","small-world network of connections","network model","negative deviations","Positive deviations","infection time","Original abstract","original paper","current containment efforts","underlying fractal","indicative","failure","novel coronavirus","citet","vazquez","SEIR","beginnings","infected individuals","COVID","spread","studies","estimate","logistical models","polynomial","ultimate extent","update","end","stages","epidemiology","approaches","dynamics","parts","assumption"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, C\u00E9sar Cinesi; Rodr\u00EDguez, \u00D3scar Pe\u00F1uelas; Torn\u00E9, Manel Luj\u00E1n; Santaolalla, Carlos Egea; Jim\u00E9nez, Juan Fernando Masa; Fern\u00E1ndez, Javier Garc\u00EDa; Manuel Carratal\u00E1 Perales, Jos\u00E9; Heili-Frades, Sarah B\u00E9atrice; Monreal, Miquel Ferrer; de Andr\u00E9s Nilsson, Jos\u00E9 M; Arias, Eva Lista; Rocamora, Juan Luis S\u00E1nchez; Ignacio Garrote, Jos\u00E9; Serrano, Miguel J.

Methods: Linear regression analysis were used to establish a linear regression model with the number of Wuhan roaming people as the dependent variable and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Henan province as the dependent variable, and to calculate and plot the regional distribution of the number of cases in 18 cities in Henan province in accordance with the criteria of whether the number of cases exceeded the expected number. Results: There was a linear correlation between the number of people Wuhan roaming and the number of cases, and the linear regression model equation was statistically significant. The cities that exceeded the expected number of cases had a clear spatio-temporal distribution. Geographically, these cities were roughly in the 1 o\u0027clock and 2 o\u0027clock directions in Nanyang, and in terms of time period, the first phase (10 days), the cities that exceeded the expected number of cases changed almost daily. In the second phase (5 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases were moderated, and in the third phase (15 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases entered the stabilization phase. Conclusions: The priority cities for COVID-19 prevention and control in Henan province should pay special attention to the cities that have exceeded the expected number of COVID-19 cases, and the implementation of high-level control measures can effectively control the spread of COVID-19 within 2-4 weeks during the early stage of the epidemic.

We hypothesize this is related to how strict, enforceable, and comprehensive are the implemented policies.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rondon-Moreno, Carlos; Arroyo Marioli, Francisco; Bullano, Francisco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cdba30bfc0aee3661462602f5a3751028e0c660.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071886v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["China","Italy","South Korea","way Rt","pandemic","countries","days","current COVID","lens","daily effective reproduction number","Japan","Kalman Filter","implementation of control measures","Bayesian estimation","center of attention","researchers","findings","methodology","data","month","significant heterogeneity","reduction","peak","implemented policies","similar levels","authorities","time","results","instance","contrast","paper"],"language":"en"},

The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country. This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to April 21, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran. Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second week. it decreased from 4.29 to 2.37 in the next four weeks. At the seventh week of the outbreak the reproduction number was reduced below 1. Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was significantly larger than one in the early stages of the outbreak. However, implementing social distancing and preventing travelling on Nowruz (Persian New Year) effectively reduced the reproduction number. Although the results indicate that reproduction number is below one, it is necessary to continue social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing a second wave of outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahafizadeh, Ebrahim; Sartoli, Samaneh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc9ea13f9b1571ab4ad85c069fe916287c15fd24.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038422","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["number of cases","basic reproduction number of COVID","value of reproduction number","number of identified cases","reported cases data","cases of coronavirus","Results","epidemic model","transmission model","Iranian governments","travelling","social distancing","wave of outbreak","novel coronavirus","Nowruz","Persian New Year","parameters","order","SIR","infections","Susceptible-Infectious","provinces","early stages","control","Qom","Background","study","country","Bahman","Conclusions","Methods","weeks"],"language":"en"},

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 \u03BCM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known Mpro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 \u00C5 resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Chunlong; Sacco, Michael D.; Hurst, Brett; Townsend, Julia A.; Hu, Yanmei; Szeto, Tommy; Zhang, Xiujun; Tarbet, Bart; Marty, Michael T.; Chen, Yu; Wang, Jun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9e10150bdd4260cff1848c9474b07dd3bca4935.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051581","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","calpain inhibitors","development of SARS","known Mpro inhibitors","discovery of inhibitors","GC","boceprevir","complex crystal structure of SARS","inhibitor binding","enzymatic assay","novel chemotypes","compounds","unique binding configurations","thermal shift binding assays","EC50 values","submicromolar IC50 values","overall mortality rate","protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate","molecular interactions","shedding light","enzyme kinetic studies","viral replication","single-digit","asymmetric unit","cell culture","native mass spectrometry","promising starting points","hits","monomers","main protease","\u00C5 resolution","potent activity","vaccine","global pandemic","mechanism of action","FRET","COVID","nCoV","disease","therapeutics","study","\u03BCM","humans"],"language":"en"},

Design: Ecological retrospective cohort study Setting Local authority districts (LADs) in England, Scotland and Wales (Great Britain (GB)). Participants All LAD deaths registered by week 16 of 2020. Main Outcome Measures Death registration where COVID-19 is mentioned as a contributing factor per 100,000 people in all settings, and in i) cares homes, ii) hospitals or iii) home only, in comparison to non-COVID-19 related deaths. Results Across GB by week 16 of 2020, 20,684 deaths had been registered mentioning COVID-19, equivalent to 25.6 per 100,000 people. Significant risk factors for LAD COVID-19 death in comparison to non-COVID-19 related death were air pollution and proportion of the population who were female. Significant protective factors were higher air temperature and proportion of the population who were ex-smokers. Conversely, for all COVID-19 unrelated deaths in comparison to COVID-19 deaths, higher rates of communal living, higher population rates of chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease deaths under 75 and dementia were predictive of death, whereas, higher rates of flight passengers was protective. Looking at individual setttings, the most notable findings in care homes was Scotland being a significant risk factor for COVID-19 related deaths compared to England. For hospital setting, the proportion of the population who were from black and Asian minority ethnic (BAME) groups significantly predicted COVID-19 related death. Conclusions This is the first study within GB to assess COVID-19 related deaths in comparison to COVID-19 unrelated deaths across hospital, care homes and home combined. As an ecological study, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to individuals. However, the analysis may be informative for public health policy and protective measures. From our hypothesis-generating analysis, we propose that air pollution is a significant risk factor and high temperature a significant protective factor for COVID-19 related deaths. These factors cannot readily be modelled at an individual level. Scottish local authorities and local authorities with a higher proportion of individuals of BAME origin are potential risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths in care homes and in hospitals, respectively. Altogether, this analysis shows the benefits of access to high quality open data for public information, public health policy and further research.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leighton, S.

Using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for US counties over a 20-day period, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths. The unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths. Counties with higher income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases. There is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports. Counties with high concentrations of non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrant populations have higher incidence of both cases and deaths. The distribution of health risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes. The stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukherji, N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdc6affd7f2b339f66bad6482436993c708d5280.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20091041v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Gini"],"keyphrases":["higher reported deaths","reported cases","places of higher cases","number of reported deaths","lower deaths","distribution of cases","health factors","higher incidence","daily reported number of cases","US counties","distribution of health risk factors","lifestyle factors","significant factors","higher economic activity","higher income inequality","country","paper","high incidence","higher numbers of primary care physicians","distribution of distance","epidemiological model of disease spread","differences","negative binomial pooled model","dynamic panel model","County-level economic","immigrant populations","personal income","lower hospital","Vulnerability Index","high-risk populations","international airports","high concentrations of non-Hispanic Blacks","low unemployment rates","weighted international passengers","spread of infectious diseases","Native Americans","different parts","coronavirus pandemic","differential impact","obesity","demographic","diabetes","day period","United States","Gini coefficient","smoking","future","preventable causes","transmission","policymakers","remarkable similarity","region","mortality","values","stay-at-home orders","research"],"language":"en"},

The absolute numbers of CD3\u002B T cells, CD4\u002B T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. Conclusion Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.

However, such time-sync comments have lots of noises due to users\u0027 diverse comments, introducing great challenges for accurate and fast video tag extractions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised video tag extraction algorithm named Semantic Weight-Inverse Document Frequency (SW-IDF). Specifically, we first generate corresponding semantic association graph (SAG) using semantic similarities and timestamps of the time-sync comments. Second, we propose two graph cluster algorithms, i.e., dialogue-based algorithm and topic center-based algorithm, to deal with the videos with different density of comments. Third, we design a graph iteration algorithm to assign the weight to each comment based on the degrees of the clustered subgraphs, which can differentiate the meaningful comments from the noises. Finally, we gain the weight of each word by combining Semantic Weight (SW) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). In this way, the video tags are extracted automatically in an unsupervised way. Extensive experiments have shown that SW-IDF (dialogue-based algorithm) achieves 0.4210 F1-score and 0.4932 MAP (Mean Average Precision) in high-density comments, 0.4267 F1-score and 0.3623 MAP in low-density comments; while SW-IDF (topic center-based algorithm) achieves 0.4444 F1-score and 0.5122 MAP in high-density comments, 0.4207 F1-score and 0.3522 MAP in low-density comments.

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bu, Jin; Peng, Dong-Dong; Xiao, Hui; Yue, Qian; Han, Yan; Lin, Yu; Hu, Gang; Chen, Jing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Shanghai","southern Pearl River Delta","Wuhan","Pearl River Delta"],"keyphrases":["Shanghai urban agglomeration","Hebei urban agglomeration","high temperature","nCoV coronavirus survival","suitable temperature range","Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration","urban agglomerations","mean temperature","temperature line","faster temperature","SARS coronavirus","original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration","degree Celsius lasting","coronavirus spreads","southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration","continuous low temperature","south China","north China","prevention","humidity range","nCoV transmission","nCoV infection","population of new coronavirus infections","novel coronavirus pneumonia","mid-high latitudes","suitable precipitation range","wide range of continuous warm","big cities","control measures","high-risk cities","Beijing-Tianjin","concentrated area of population","new disease","eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang","meteorological factors","approach of spring","mid-latitude","meteorological condition","coming of spring","infectious disease","prediction results","dry weather","outbreak period","week","addition","vector","days","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","scientific basis","epidemiology","website","Cold air","humans","study","reproduction of coronaviruses","global perspective","elimination","Conclusions","incidence","monitoring of transportation hubs","public sources","epidemic","Objective","Methods","Data of patients","month"],"language":"en"},

Rapid and precise identification of cases and tracing of transmission chains is critical to end outbreaks and to inform prevention measures. Methods: We combined conventional surveillance with Influenza A virus (IAV) genome sequencing to identify and contain a large IAV outbreak in a metropolitan healthcare system. A total of 381 individuals, including 91 inpatients and 290 health care workers (HCWs), were included in the investigation. Results: During a 12-day period in early 2019, infection preventionists identified 89 HCWs and 18 inpatients as cases of influenza-like illness (ILI), using an amended definition, without the requirement for fever. Sequencing of IAV genomes from available nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens identified 66 individuals infected with a nearly identical strain of influenza A H1N1 (43 HCWs, 17 inpatients, and 6 with unspecified affiliation). All HCWs infected with the outbreak strain had received the seasonal influenza virus vaccination. Characterization of five representative outbreak viral isolates did not show antigenic drift. In conjunction with IAV genome sequencing, mining of electronic records pinpointed the origin of the outbreak as a single patient and a few interactions in the emergency department that occurred one day prior to the index ILI cluster. Conclusions: We used precision surveillance to identify and control a large nosocomial IAV outbreak, mapping the source of the outbreak to a single patient rather than HCWs as initially assumed based on conventional epidemiology. These findings have important ramifications for more effective prevention strategies to curb nosocomial respiratory virus outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Javaid, W.; Ehni, J.; Gonzalez-Reiche, A.

Materials and Methods Beginning March 2020, radiologists were relocated to workspaces outside of conventional reading rooms. Information technologies were employed to allow for \u2018remote readouts\u2019 between trainees and attendings. An optional anonymous open-ended survey regarding remote readouts was administered to radiology trainees and attendings as a quality improvement initiative. From the responses, response themes were abstracted using thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics of the qualitative data were calculated. Results Radiologist workstations from 14 traditional reading rooms were relocated to 36 workspaces across the hospital system. Two models of remote readouts, synchronous and asynchronous, were developed, facilitated by commercially-available information technologies. 39/105 (37%) trainees and 42/90 (47%) attendings responded to the survey. Main response themes included: social distancing, technology, autonomy/competency, efficiency, education/feedback and atmosphere/professional relationship. 148 positive versus 97 negative comments were reported. Social distancing, technology and autonomy/competency were most positively rated. Trainees and attending perspectives differed regarding the efficiency of remote readouts. Conclusions \u2018Remote readouts\u2019, compliant with social distancing measures, are feasible in academic radiology practice settings.

The virus spike glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins are the main targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, to control the disease spread. We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for conserved epitopes that may help to develop long-lasting, broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forcelloni, Sergio; Benedetti, Anna; Dilucca, Maddalena; Giansanti, Andrea","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/391a15ed0bedaba92a8f6cca7e3bf455ce2aa4dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.095133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["broad-spectrum SARS-CoV","spike protein epitopes","MERS-CoV","conserved epitopes","nucleocapsid proteins","protein regions","vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes","T cell epitopes","high rates of evolution","fusion peptide of spike protein","HCoV-NL63","HCoV-OC43","sequences of spike","HCoV-HKU1","virus spike glycoproteins","severe acute respiratory disease","low rates of evolutions","structural order-disorder propensities","structural order-disorder propensity","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","RNA-binding","B cell","development of vaccines","novel virus","disease spread","receptor-binding motif","ACE2","main targets","relation","antiviral drugs","spatial locations","correspondence","orthologs","results","evidence","human coronaviruses","dimerization domains","immune response","heptad repeats","conclusion","host immunity","infections","Wuhan","China","purpose"],"language":"en"},

The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. Results After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient. Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55 \u00D7 104 to 1.39 \u00D7 103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion. Conclusions With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6 based on confirmed cases and ~2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Russo, Lucia; Tsakris, Athanasios; Siettos, Constantinos","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2858f25f5364b0ef37ceeaa370471ee6b3fac29d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["infected cases","confirmed number of infected","confirmed number of recovered cases","cumulative number of infected","number of infected individuals","China","official counts of confirmed cases","scenario","Susceptible-Infected","reported data","actual numbers of infected","number of deaths unchanged","times","actual cumulative numbers of infected","hospitalization of infected individuals","basic reproduction number","case fatality ratio","SIRD simulations","official numbers","total population","reported ones","case recovery ratios","Hubei Province","unfolding outbreak","available epidemiological data","suspected case of coronavirus disease","expected value of R0","SIRD model","basis","estimated average value of R0","main epidemiological parameters","recovery rates","estimations","significant decline","quarantine","day infection mortality","Dead","SIDR","severe control measures","note of caution","estimates","Wuhan","subset","mild courses","forecasting","COVID","analysis","confidence intervals","epicenter","weeks","death toll","calculations","end","various factors","evoking fear","period","evolution"],"language":"en"},

Information on mutations within the circulating strains of the virus is pivotal to understand disease spread and dynamics. Here, we analyse the mutations associated with 2,954 globally reported high quality genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on genomes of viral strains from India. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India form five distinct phyletic clades designated R1-R5. These clades categorize into the previously reported S, G as well as a new unclassified subtype. A detailed analysis of gene encoding the Spike (S) protein in the strains across the globe shows non-synonymous mutations on 54 amino acid residues. Among these, we pinpoint 4 novel mutations in the region that interacts with human ACE2 receptor (RBD). Further in silico molecular docking analyses suggest that these RBD mutations could alter the binding affinity of S-protein with ACE2 that may lead to changes in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Strikingly, one of these RBD mutations (S438F) is unique to a subset within the R4 clade suggesting intrinsic S-protein variations in strains currently circulating in India.

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanization and co-morbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal. Methods: We use an augmented deterministic SIR model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We dis-aggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanization, and co-morbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anemia). Results: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanization, and factoring-in co-morbidities, the peak may occur between June 2nd and June 17th (Ghana), July 22 and August 29 (Kenya), and finally May 28th and June15th. Successful containment policies could lead to even lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project accounting for rural areas and comorbidities and in the absence of policies further containing the spread that between 0.78 and 1.03%, 0.61 and 1.22%, and 0.60 and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal will be actively infected and develop severe symptoms at the peak of the epidemic. Conclusion: Compared to Europe, Africa\u0027s younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected.

We aim to evaluate the impact of containment measures and the epidemic features of COVID-19 under social NPIs in Mainland China. Methods Under the strict social NPIs, the spreading pattern of COVID-19 in China has changed into mostly clustered intra-household or intro-acquaintance transmission, and we established a stochastic NPIs model, named ScEIQRsh to fit the epidemic and NPIs data of each province in China. Results This ScEIQRsh model could be well fitted with both the reported number of accumulative confirmed cases and epidemiological survey (EPS)-based quarantined cases of each province in China. We found that the median transmission rate of COVID-19 among acquaintances was 10.22 (IQR 8.47, 12.35) across Mainland China and the COVID-19 spreading was prevented by NPIs implementation within 25-30 days. Among NPIs, measures to diminish contactable susceptible (Sc), such as staying home, travel constraint etc. and measures to avoid delay of diagnosis and hospitalized isolation ({eta}) were more effective than EPS-based quarantine ({kappa},{rho} or surveyQ). Upon the fitted models, the proportion of asymptomatic infectors was determined to be 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%). The median incubation period and communicable period of COVID-19 under NPIs were 4.16 (IQR 3.60, 4.71) and 6.77 (IQR 4.53, 10.36) days respectively, and the median time from exposed to being contagious was 2.39 (IQR 2.26, 2.56) days. Besides, we identified that the optimal temperature for COVID-19 spreading was in the range of 5{degrees}C-14{degrees}C. Conclusion This study provided useful suggestions about NPI strategy for the prevention of COVID-19 spreading, which should be helpful for the control of COVID-19, as well as other similar infectious disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, D.; Tai, Q.; Wang, Y.; Pu, M.; Ge, S.; Ji, T.; Zhang, L.; Su, B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/763af95c8fd5e22193615929ff7fe065f30f6011.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20099267v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPI"],"locations":["Mainland China","China"],"keyphrases":["prevention of COVID","mitigating COVID","control of COVID","spreading pattern of COVID","epidemic features of COVID","NPIs data","NPIs implementation","communicable period of COVID","median transmission rate of COVID","strict social NPIs","stochastic NPIs model","Mainland China","days","median incubation period","degrees","province","median time","ScEIQRsh model","impact of containment measures","EPS-based quarantine","quarantined cases","fitted models","intro-acquaintance transmission","reported number of accumulative confirmed cases","study","epidemiological survey","NPI strategy","useful suggestions","clustered intra-household","delay of diagnosis","early non-pharmaceutical Interventions","eta","hospitalized isolation","Conclusion","kappa","proportion of asymptomatic infectors","range","Methods","optimal temperature","acquaintances","travel constraint","similar infectious disease","rho","surveyQ"],"language":"en"},

Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2\u002BTMPRSS2\u002B cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muus, Christoph; Luecken, Malte D.; Eraslan, Gokcen; Waghray, Avinash; Heimberg, Graham; Sikkema, Lisa; Kobayashi, Yoshihiko; Vaishnav, Eeshit Dhaval; Subramanian, Ayshwarya; Smilie, Christopher; Jagadeesh, Karthik; Duong, Elizabeth Thu; Fiskin, Evgenij; Triglia, Elena Torlai; Ansari, Meshal; Cai, Peiwen; Lin, Brian; Buchanan, Justin; Chen, Sijia; Shu, Jian; Haber, Adam L; Chung, Hattie; Montoro, Daniel T; Adams, Taylor; Aliee, Hananeh; Samuel, J.; Andrusivova, Allon Zaneta; Angelidis, Ilias; Ashenberg, Orr; Bassler, Kevin; B\u00E9cavin, Christophe; Benhar, Inbal; Bergenstr\u00E5hle, Joseph; Bergenstr\u00E5hle, Ludvig; Bolt, Liam; Braun, Emelie; Bui, Linh T; Chaffin, Mark; Chichelnitskiy, Evgeny; Chiou, Joshua; Conlon, Thomas M; Cuoco, Michael S; Deprez, Marie; Fischer, David S; Gillich, Astrid; Gould, Joshua; Guo, Minzhe; Gutierrez, Austin J; Habermann, Arun C; Harvey, Tyler; He, Peng; Hou, Xiaomeng; Hu, Lijuan; Jaiswal, Alok; Jiang, Peiyong; Kapellos, Theodoros; Kuo, Christin S; Larsson, Ludvig; Kyungtae Lim, Michael A.

Because of the rapid nature of the public health response, it is critical to reassess and readjust our approach to best address the needs of PwDs in the months and years to come and to incorporate these new practices into future emergency preparedness responses.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyle, Coleen A.; Fox, Michael H.; Havercamp, Susan M.; Zubler, Jennifer","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8371edb379e76eaa7ae7f8f2583f8b89c01f46c0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1936657420300686; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657420300686?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PwDs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["needs of PwDs","public health response","best address","global public health priority","public health areas of ongoing need","outbreak","help","prevention","treatment","safety long term","access","new practices","future emergency preparedness responses","disabilities","quality of medical care","mitigation measures","approach","rapid nature","well-being of people","changing landscape","possible strategies","issues of equity","Covid","risks","months","commentary","types of data","Abstract","years","duration"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (\u003C1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our objective is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merino-Navarro, Dolores; Peri\u00E1nez, Cristina D\u00EDaz","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9a812f983c9bf455ca81d3c7b5c346680c9fe3d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1130862120303016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1130862120303016?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Espa\u00F1a","Spain"],"keyphrases":["contain the spread of the","The importance of caring for children in the face of the","know the specificity of","and among the recommendations","Given the rapidity with which the COVID","the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement","fear and helplessness in the face of","The main recommendations and preventive","Abstract Based on the report on the situation of COVID","for the prevention of contagion due","improve the available recommendations","of which","At the household level","process in the child population","the confirmed cases amount","as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID","analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID","from the family and community settings","little evidence at the moment","above all in ensuring the correct","years of age","Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs","manifestations of uncertainty","the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up","in Spain","casos de COVID","situaci\u00F3n de COVID","and order through","recomendaciones espec\u00EDficas","in routine preventive actions","and leisure together with hygiene","in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that","ni\u00F1os","recomendaciones disponibles","principales recomendaciones","an important challenge for","medidas preventivas","correctas medidas de prevenci\u00F3n","that children actively","Pandemic","atenci\u00F3n pedi\u00E1trica","adecuada prevenci\u00F3n","edad pedi\u00E1trica","medidas de higiene","Espa\u00F1a","Pandemia","enfermedad","where there","edad inferior","casos confirmados","entornos de atenci\u00F3n primaria","acciones preventivas habituales","be developed","isolation","establishing","occurred","horarios de actividades","ocio unido","domicilio","salud","contenci\u00F3n","tratamiento","dated April","under","aspectos biopsicosociales","rutinas orden","Our objective","aislamiento","per\u00EDodo de incubaci\u00F3n","proceso","familias","miedo","indefensi\u00F3n","manifestaciones de incertidumbre","posibles portadores","enfoque integrador","condici\u00F3n","estudios espec\u00EDficos","poblaci\u00F3n infantil","evidencia cient\u00EDfica","days","evidencias","importante reto","especificidad","objetivo","confinamiento","infancia","expansi\u00F3n","cambios","impacto","\u00E1mbito familiar","informe","nivel domiciliario","importancia","cuidados","d\u00EDas","Resumen","momento","art\u00EDculo","recomendaci\u00F3n","rapidez"],"language":"es"},

Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing performance across countries or territories (such as states in the USA), and could inform policy decisions about COVID-19 mitigation strategies. But comparing cases and fatality across territories is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across countries or US states. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity-of-COVID-19-case-incidence. We found a 10% increase in testing yielded ~9% (95% CI:4.2-13.4%; p\u003C0.001) increase in reported cases across countries, and ~2% (95%CI:0.1-3.4%; p=0.03) increase across US states during the week ending April 10th, 2020. We found comparable negative elasticities for fatality rates (across countries: beta;=-0.77, 95%CI:-1.40- -0.14; p=0.02; US states: beta;=-0.15, 95%CI:-0.30-0.01; p=0.06). Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio (PTR) growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public health officials as more consistent data hopefully becomes available.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asahi, K.; Undurraga, E.

In this study, we performed proteomic profiling of urine samples from 32 healthy control individuals and 6 COVID-19 positive patients (3 mild and 3 severe). We found that urine proteome samples from the mild and severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities can be clearly differentiated from healthy proteome samples based on the clustering analysis.

In this situation, guidelines for health care professionals in endoscopy units with increased risk of infection from inhalation of airborne droplets, conjunctival contact and faeces are urgently needed. Recently, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the German Society for Pneumology (DGP) issued recommendations. However, real-world data on the conditions and requirements of endoscopy units to adhere to this guidance are missing. Design: We conducted an internet-based survey among German endoscopy units from all levels of care from April 1st to 7th, 2020. The survey comprised 33 questions and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) and the DGP. Results: In total, 656 endoscopy units completed the survey. Overall, 253 units (39%) cancelled fewer than 40% of their procedures. Of note, private practices cancelled less procedures than hospital-based units. Complete separation of high-risk and COVID-19 positive patients was achieved in only 20% of the units. Procedural measures were well adopted, with 91% of the units systematically identifying patients at risk and 85% using risk-adapted personal protective equipment (PPE). For the future, shortages in PPE (81%), staff (69%) and relevant financial losses (77%) were expected. Conclusion: Concise definitions of non-urgent, elective interventions and endoscopic surveillance strategies are needed to better guide endoscopic activity and intervention cancellations. In the short term, a lack of PPE can constitute considerable impairment of endoscopy units\u0027 operability and patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garbe, J.; Eisenmann, S.; Heidemann, C.

Abstract Objective Describe the epidemiological and clinical pattern of Bordetella pertussis infection (whooping cough) among hospitalised infants less than one year-old in a paediatric hospital in Gran Canaria. Patients and methods A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. Results A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months-old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 to 425.0 cases per 100,000 infants \u003C12 months old, with 2peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (P\u003C.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. Conclusions The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iglesias, Laura; Casabella Pernas, Antonio; Hern\u00E1ndez Febles, Melisa; Colino Gil, Elena; Eisman Maraver, Alicia; Pena L\u00F3pez, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa01c29dbfecae6c944aa503f98b30db9b7dea79.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1695403317304538; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403317304538","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. pertussis","mainly pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gran Canaria"],"keyphrases":["of the patients","in the incidence in the future","of infection","Conclusions The incidence of","total of","of which","peaks in","of infants diagnosed with","infection occurred in","Complications occurred in","increased in the last years in Gran Canaria","the epidemiological and clinical pattern of Bordetella","with a lower development of complications and mortality","old in a paediatric hospital in Gran Canaria","microbiological diagnosis of","but the outcome was favourable in all the cases","and lymphocytosis","compared with the previous period","cough associated with signs of catarrh","The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between","vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications","especially in infants younger than","Patients and methods A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed","lower age and non","Household members were the main potential","and recording only those with","were less than","were males","incidencia de infecci\u00F3n","patients were identified","months old","menor desarrollo de complicaciones","pacientes diagnosticados","ni\u00F1os menores","Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead","hospital pedi\u00E1trico","menor edad","lactantes menores","vaccination status","infection detected using","Main clinical","vacunaci\u00F3n previa","incidencia anual","casos","among hospitalised infants less than one year","considered risk factors for developing complications","whooping cough","cases per","principales manifestaciones","factores de riesgo","mayor riesgo","Viral co","coinfecci\u00F3n viral","principales fuentes de contagio potenciales","mainly pneumonia","chain reaction","tos pertusoide asociada","cyanosis","signos catarrales","tasas de mortalidad inferiores","from January","Abstract Objective","cianosis","patr\u00F3n epidemiol\u00F3gico","historias cl\u00EDnicas","diagn\u00F3stico microbiol\u00F3gico","per\u00EDodo anterior","tosferina","Results","Resumen Objetivo","familiares cercanos","linfocitosis","December","evoluci\u00F3n","reacci\u00F3n","m\u00E9todos","\u00E1rea","mujeres embarazadas","neumon\u00EDa","futuro","cadena","polimerasa","hospitalizaci\u00F3n","Conclusiones","Resultados","varones","picos"],"language":"es"},

A rapidly progressing epidemic of COVID-19 ensued within China, with multiple exportations to other countries. We aimed to measure perceptions and responses towards COVID-19 in three countries to understand how population-level anxiety can be mitigated in the early phases of a pandemic. Methods Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy with a total of 4,505 respondents to measure knowledge, perceptions, anxiety and behaviours towards the COVID-19 epidemic, and identified factors associated with lower anxiety and more positive behavioural responses. Findings Respondents reported high awareness of COVID-19 and its accompanying symptoms, comparable information seeking habits and similarly high levels of information sufficiency, adherence to and acceptance of public health control measures. Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower anxiety levels in all three countries, while willingness to comply with restrictive measures and greater information sufficiency were associated with more positive behavioural changes to reduce spread of infection.

To illustrate how ecological studies and results could be biased, we conducted an ecological study of COVID-19 outcomes and the distance to Brussels using European country-level data.

Summary The viral safety of biologicals, either human blood derivatives or animal products or recombinant proteins issued from biotechnology, relies on the quality of the starting material, the manufacturing process and, if necessary, the control of the final product. The quality of the starting material is highly guaranteed for blood derivatives due to the individual screening for specific markers (antigens, genome, antibodies) for major blood borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It can be reinforced by the detection through amplification procedures (polymerase chain reaction) in the plasma pool of genomes from viruses that have been implicated in contaminations of blood derivatives in the past (parvovirus B19, hepatitis A virus). The association in the manufacturing process of different steps dedicated to purification of plasma proteins (partitioning), virus inactivation (solvent/detergent treatment, heat inactivation) or specific procedures allowing virus removal (nanofiltration) allows to reduce the viral risk very efficiently. The validation studies using scaled down systems and model viruses allow to evaluate the virus safety of any product quantitatively. The aim of these procedures is to guarantee the lack of infectivity due to any virus, either known or unknown.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barin, F.","journal":"Annales Pharmaceutiques Fran\u00E7aises","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de24f1c8b627bfb2fda36765cf9e3bd69e3ca84a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000345090800062X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000345090800062X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the quality","the control","The aim","The association in the manufacturing process","inactivation des virus","virus inactivation","the final product","to the individual screening","in the plasma pool","to any virus","virus connus","\u00E9limination des virus","virus majeurs","virus inconnus","Summary The viral safety","blood derivatives in the past","model viruses allow to evaluate the virus safety","the detection through amplification procedures","human immunodeficiency virus","these procedures is to guarantee the lack","the starting material is highly guaranteed","allows to reduce the viral risk very efficiently","specific procedures allowing virus removal","The validation studies using scaled down systems","\u00E9tapes de purification","m\u00E9dicaments d\u00E9riv\u00E9s","\u00E9tapes de partition","produits finis","\u00E9tapes d\u00E9di\u00E9es","qualit\u00E9 de la mati\u00E8re premi\u00E8re","\u00E9tapes aptes","proc\u00E9d\u00E9 de fabrication","s\u00E9curit\u00E9 virale","either human blood derivatives","contr\u00F4les des produits interm\u00E9diaires","plasma proteins","origine biologique","different steps dedicated to purification","implicated in contaminations","genomes from viruses that","major blood borne viruses such as hepatitis","heat inactivation","nanofiltration","screening des dons","screening individuel","sang","risque viral","either known or unknown","MDS","infectiosit\u00E9 li\u00E9e","d\u00E9veloppement des principes","origine humaine","absence","any product quantitatively","specific markers","\u00E9tudes de validation","principes actifs","premiers \u00E9l\u00E9ments","contr\u00F4les virologiques","d\u00E9veloppement du concept","recombinant proteins issued from biotechnology","polymerase chain reaction","animal products","infectivity","biologicals","if necessary","parvovirus B19","antibodies","solvent","partitioning","risques iatrog\u00E8nes li\u00E9s","It can be reinforced","detergent treatment","antigens","traitement solvant","g\u00E9nomes","\u00E9preuves de surcharge","biotechnologies","chauffage","HBV","contributions","d\u00E9tergent","techniques de s\u00E9curisation","HCV","prise de conscience","crises sanitaires survenues","antig\u00E8nes","marqueurs directs","anticorps","\u00E9chelle r\u00E9duite","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","ann\u00E9es","cellules eucaryotes","anticipation","HIV","garantie","succession","r\u00E9duction"],"language":"fr"},

However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms \u0022COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2\u0022 AND \u0022Pediatric OR children\u0022 on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, X.; Qian, K.; Xie, L.-l.; Li, X.-j.; Cheng, M.; Jiang, L.; Schuller, B.

Medical editorials have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be given to people with arterial hypertension during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of a potential increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be used as an alternative. Methods Using a cohort of 610 COVID-19 cases and 48,667 population-based controls from Zheijang, China we have tested the role of usage of ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs and other medications on risk and severity of COVID 19. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and BMI and for presence of relevant comorbidities. Findings: Higher BMI, diabetes and cardio/ cerebrovascular disease as independent risk factors for the development of COVID-19. Individuals with hypertension taking CCBs had significantly increased risk [odds ratio (OR)= 1.67 (95% CI 1.2-2.9)) of manifesting symptoms of COVID-19 whereas those taking ARBs and diuretics had significantly lower disease risk (OR=0.24; 95%CI 0.17-0.34 and OR=0.32; 95%CI 0.19-0.57 respectively). Other antihypertensive drugs were not associated with increased risk of severe or critical form of the infection.

In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases.

However, with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed. Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection. Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development.

Furthermore, 65.63% (21/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR negative samples were GICA positive.

Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic. Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed. Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined. Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hammoumi, A.; Qesmi, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8604b20d5f9bd465f0656ca2cf5bf1c8550f60f1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20080770v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["compulsory containment","containment rates","containment measure","different rates of containment","epidemic characteristics of COVID","spread of COVID","epidemic duration","simulations of different scenarios of containment","case of COVID","basic reproduction number","Morocco","threshold value of containment rate","cumulative number","asymptomatic duration","consequent social-economic damages","Infectious model","Susceptible-Asymptomatic","infectious cases","control reproduction numbers","size of asymptomatic population","Results","cumulative confirmed cases","Moroccan government","model parameter values","data","lead","high speed","findings","human","impact","contact","transmission","mass testing","Earlier knowledge","optimal plan","action","appearance","sensitivity analysis investigation","dynamics","measures","Method","end-time","country","Background","Conclusion","aim"],"language":"en"},

Given that Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) are known to be activated during and participate in inflammatory processes, we examined whether HERV dysregulation signatures are present in COVID-19 patients. Results: By comparing transcriptomes of Peripheral Blood Monocytes (PBMCs) and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) from patients and normal controls we have shown that HERVs are intensely dysregulated in BALF, but not in PBMCs. In particular, upregulation in the expression of multiple HERV families was detected in BALF samples of COVID-19 patients, with HERV-W being the most highly upregulated family among the families analysed. In addition, we compared the expression of HERVs in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBECs) without and after senescence induction in an oncogene-induced senescence model, in order to quantitatively measure changes in the expression of HERVs in bronchial cells during the processes of cellular senescence. Conclusions: This apparent difference of HERV dysregulation between PBMCs and BALF warrants further studies in involvement of HERVs in inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms as well as exploration of HERVs as potential biomarkers for disease progression. Furthermore, the increase in the expression of HERVs in senescent HBECs in comparison to non-induced HBECs provides a potential link for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality in aged populations.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kitsou, K.; Kotanidou, A.; Paraskevis, D.; Karamitros, T.; Katzourakis, A.; Tedder, R.; Hurst, T.; Sapounas, S.; Kotsinas, A.; Gorgoulis, V.; Spoulou, V.; Tsiodras, S.; Lagiou, P.; Magiorkinis, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20096958v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Endogenous Retroviruses","HERV","Peripheral Blood Monocytes","Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of HERVs","exploration of HERVs","involvement of HERVs","PBMCs","BALF samples of COVID","patients","expression of multiple HERV families","HERV-W","increased COVID","inflammatory processes","Severe COVID","HERV dysregulation signatures","non-induced HBECs","senescent HBECs","bronchial cells","apparent difference of HERV dysregulation","senescence induction","processes of cellular senescence","Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells","oncogene-induced senescence model","inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms","potential link","potential biomarkers","development of intense inflammatory responses","Human Endogenous Retroviruses","severity","comparison","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid","course of infections","transcriptomes of Peripheral Blood Monocytes","mortality","studies","pneumonia","order","disease progression","upregulation","normal controls","SARS-CoV","aged populations","upregulated family","Background","Conclusions","changes","Results","addition"],"language":"en"},

Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly \u0026 Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (\u003E95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that POLAR diagnoses on 10 of 10 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (half positive, half negative) match those obtained in a CLIA-certified lab using the Center for Disease Control\u2019s 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8-hour experiment, at a cost of \u223C$30/patient, enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included. Further testing and refinement will likely enable greater enhancements in the sensitivity of the above approach.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"St Hilaire, Brian Glenn; Durand, Neva C.; Mitra, Namita; Pulido, Saul Godinez; Mahajan, Ragini; Blackburn, Alyssa; Colaric, Zane L.; Theisen, Joshua W.

Virus and host cell dynamics are strictly connected, and convey in virion assembly to ensure virus spread in the body. Study of the systemic behavior of virus-host interaction at the single-cell level is a scientific challenge, considering the difficulties of using experimental approaches and the limited knowledge of the behavior of emerging novel virus as a collectivity. This work focuses on positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, like human coronaviruses, in their virus-individual host interaction, studying the changes induced in the host cell bioenergetics. A systems-thinking representation, based on stock-flow diagramming of virus-host interaction at the cellular level, is used here for the first time to simulate the system energy dynamics. We found that reducing the energy flow which fuels virion assembly is the most affordable strategy to limit the virus spread, but its efficacy is mitigated by the contemporary inhibition of other flows relevant for the system. Summary Positive-single-strand ribonucleic acid ((\u002B)ssRNA) viruses can cause multiple outbreaks, for which comprehensive tailored therapeutic strategies are still missing. Virus and host cell dynamics are strictly connected, generating a complex dynamics that conveys in virion assembly to ensure virus spread in the body. This work focuses on (\u002B)ssRNA viruses in their virus-individual host interaction, studying the changes induced in the host cell bioenergetics. A systems-thinking representation, based on stock-flow diagramming of virus-host interaction at the cellular level, is used here for the first time to simulate the energy dynamics of the system. By means of a computational simulator based on the systemic diagramming, we identifid host protein recycling and folded-protein synthesis as possible new leverage points. These also address different strategies depending on time setting of the therapeutic procedures. Reducing the energy flow which fuels virion assembly is addressed as the most affordable strategy to limit the virus spread, but its efficacy is mitigated by the contemporary inhibition of other flows relevant for the system. Counterintuitively, targeting RNA replication or virion budding does not give rise to relevant systemic effects, and can possibly contribute to further virus spread. The tested combinations of multiple systemic targets are less efficient in minimizing the stock of virions than targeting only the virion assembly process, due to the systemic configuration and its evolution overtime. Viral load and early addressing (in the first two days from infection) of leverage points are the most effective strategies on stock dynamics to minimize virion assembly and preserve host-cell bioenergetics. As a whole, our work points out the need for a systemic approach to design effective therapeutic strategies that should take in account the dynamic evolution of the system.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, Alessandra; Casazza, Marco; Gonella, Francesco","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d06511111b0afabe34aa962d0a58a8f1aef23f7f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.092866","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-individual host interaction","host cell dynamics","systemic behavior of virus","host cell bioenergetics","host-cell bioenergetics","stock-flow diagramming of virus","stock dynamics","system energy dynamics","virion assembly process","systemic diagramming","behavior of emerging novel virus","single-cell level","virion budding","energy flow","identifid host protein recycling","systemic approach","systemic configuration","effective strategies","complex dynamics","relevant systemic effects","comprehensive tailored therapeutic strategies","design effective therapeutic strategies","different strategies","work","multiple outbreaks","ssRNA viruses","flows relevant","stock of virions","cellular level","therapeutic procedures","tested combinations of multiple systemic targets","single-stranded RNA viruses","changes","Summary Positive-single","contemporary inhibition","affordable strategy","representation","efficacy","systems","body","possible new leverage points","protein synthesis","positive-sense","RNA replication","dynamic evolution","evolution overtime","limited knowledge","human coronaviruses","strand ribonucleic acid","rise","account","scientific challenge","difficulties","experimental approaches","days","need","early addressing","Viral load","infection","collectivity","computational simulator","Study"],"language":"en"},

It consists in reducing social interactions. This is taken into account by the introduction of a factor of reduction of social interactions q, and by decreasing the transmission coefficient of the disease accordingly. Evaluating q is a difficult question and one can ask if it makes sense to compute an average coefficient q for a given population, in order to make predictions on the basic reproduction rate R0, the dynamics of the epidemic or the fraction of the population that will have been infected by the end of the epidemic. On a very simple example, we show that the computation of R0 in a heterogeneous population is not reduced to the computation of an average q but rather to the direct computation of an average coefficient R0. Even more interesting is the fact that, in a range of data compatible with the Covid-19 outbreak, the size of the epidemic is deeply modified by social heterogeneity, as is the height of the epidemic peak, while the date at which it is reached mainly depends on the average R0 coefficient.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dolbeault, J.; TURINICI, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c3843573237de7e612b5b82f4113ed939953257.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20103010v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["average q","average coefficient q","average coefficient R0","average R0 coefficient","computation of R0","social interactions q","epidemic peak","transmission coefficient","direct computation","given population","heterogeneous population","social heterogeneity","basic reproduction rate R0","predictions","dynamics","factor of reduction","Covid","order","outbreak","height","range of data compatible","introduction","size","fraction","sense","lockdown","account","difficult question","disease","spread","date","simple example","goal","end"],"language":"en"},

The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness.

However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by some RT-PCR methods, probably due to low viral load, timing of sampling, degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or possible mutations spanning the primer binding sites. Therefore, alternative and highly sensitive methods are imperative. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodating various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 343 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. We further amplified the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome from 8 to half a million viral copies purified from 13 COVID-19 positive specimens, and detected mutations through next generation sequencing. Finally, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method in parallel, that required modest sequencing depth for uncovering SARS-CoV-2 mutational diversity and potentially novel or emerging isolates.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chenyu; Debruyne, David N.; Spencer, Julia; Kapoor, Vidushi; Liu, Lily Y.; Zhou, Bo; Pandey, Utsav; Bootwalla, Moiz; Ostrow, Dejerianne; Maglinte, Dennis T; Ruble, David; Ryutov, Alex; Shen, Lishuang; Lee, Lucie; Feigelman, Rounak; Burdon, Grayson; Liu, Jeffrey; Oliva, Alejandra; Borcherding, Adam; Tan, Hongdong; Urban, Alexander E.; Gai, Xiaowu; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Liu, Guoying; Liu, Zhitong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e8c924795d799685bd231df5e144481ae64491.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.988246","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiplex-PCR","RT-PCR methods","detection methods","uncovering SARS-CoV","entire SARS-CoV","based method","sensitive methods","viral copies","based metagenomic method","low viral load","timing of sampling","sampling process","possible mutations","detected mutations","generation sequencing","positive specimens","high sensitivity","surveillance of COVID","positive cases","copies of viruses","modest sequencing depth","low copy numbers","clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes","mutational diversity","degradation of virus RNA","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","direct identification of positives","assay","primer binding sites","various application settings","efficiency","pairs of specific primers","emerging isolates","electrophoresis","genome","diagnosis","goal"],"language":"en"},

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24--65% (and peak deaths 15--69%), compared to 2--9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9--18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eikenberry, Steffen E.; Mancuso, Marina; Iboi, Enahoro; Phan, Tin; Eikenberry, Keenan; Kuang, Yang; Kostelich, Eric; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83ec7b07583e27223ea64281d43e7427417af671.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055624","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York","Washington"],"keyphrases":["effective masks","use of face masks","weak masks","Face mask use","community transmission of COVID","effective transmission rate","ineffective face masks","asymptomatic transmission","curtailing community transmission","underlying transmission rate","general public","baseline transmission","peak deaths","community-wide impact of mask use","New York state","Washington","Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios","peak daily death rate","peak death reduction","broad adoption","peak hospitalizations","US states of New York","general population","asymptomatic public","coverage rate","community-wide benefits","product of mask effectiveness","fraction","mortality reduction","pandemic","projected deaths","non-pharmaceutical practices","non-pharmaceutical measures","high value","epidemic dynamics","Model simulations","infectious contacts","compartmental model","immediate near universal","linear proportion","illness","data relevant","conjunction","healthy persons","epidemiologic outcomes","burden","months","spread","social-distancing","changes","respect","results","compliance","order","potential","intervention"],"language":"en"},

Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in healthcare systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1100W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log10 plaque forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log10 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single three-minute microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zulauf, K.

Here, we evaluated pathogenesis and host transcription in response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in two different viral antagonists: the deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 and the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within nonstructural protein 15. The virus with reduced ability to deubiquitinate proteins, herein termed the DUBmut virus, was engineered via X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and activates an earlier interferon response than the wild type virus. However, the replication kinetics of DUBmut in cultured cells are similar to wild type virus and pathogenesis in mice is also similar to what was observed during infection with wild type virus. On the other hand, we previously reported that an EndoUmut virus containing an inactivated endoribonuclease activity elicited rapid and robust activation of type I interferon, which limited virus replication and pathogenesis. Here, using a transcriptomics approach, we compared the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild type, DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response, predominantly involving type I interferons and a subset of interferon-responsive genes, within 12 hours after infection. In contrast, the wild type and DUBmut viruses stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways and a proinflammatory profile associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivation of a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages and the disease process. Author Summary Macrophages are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they \u201Cnotice\u201D the infection and respond by activating type I interferons, which then act to establish antiviral defenses and limit virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell\u2019s ability to detect virus replication or amplify the interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses: one with a reduced deubiquitinating activity (DUBmut), and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes. These results indicate that coronaviruses utilize EndoU activity for preventing early activation of interferon in macrophages, thereby allowing for viral replication. In contrast, DUBmut elicited a transient interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including many well-known players in pro-inflammatory pathways and the unfolded protein response. These DUBmut-induced pathways are associated with development and progression of significant disease, similar to what is observed during wild type virus infection. This study demonstrates the distinct consequences of mutating different viral interferon antagonists and reveals that intact coronaviral EndoU activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to replicate in macrophages.","publish_time":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xufang; Volk, Aaron; Chen, Yafang; Kesely, Kristina R.; Hackbart, Matthew; Mettelman, Robert C.; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c637755575052598777406eec57cfb828749ee2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/782409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["X-ray","Author Summary Macrophages"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host response","wild type virus infection","earlier interferon response","transient interferon response","focused response","limit virus replication","host macrophage response","subset of interferon","viral replication","role of viral interferon antagonists","activation of unfolded protein response","multiple interferon antagonists","interferon-stimulated genes","replication kinetics of DUBmut","early activation of interferon","robust activation of type","viral pathogenesis","DUBmut viruses","ability of coronaviruses","enhanced expression of interferon","different viral antagonists","important cell type","distinct consequences of mutating different viral interferon antagonists","DUBmut-induced pathways","host transcription","murine coronaviruses","EndoUmut viruses","inactivated endoribonuclease activity","coronavirus endoribonuclease","independent mutant coronaviruses","nonstructural protein","infected macrophages","dominant viral antagonist","responsive genes","reduced ability","reduced deubiquitinating activity","Author Summary Macrophages","intact coronaviral EndoU activity","proteins","cell\u2019s ability","study","contrast","interferons","pro-inflammatory pathways","independent mutations","coronavirus infections","disease process","progression of significant disease","cultured cells","deubiquitinase","development","well-known players","X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis","proinflammatory profile","scope","inactivation","upregulation","mice","magnitude","antiviral defenses","notice","hours","results","transcriptomics approach","turn","hand"],"language":"en"},

We attempted to deduce a formula in order to model the number of the ICU patients in France from the official data and patient turnover in the ICU. METHODS: The Covid19 ICU patient turnover was calculated using a recurrence relation from the internal data provided by Hospices Civils de Lyon. The number of new Covid19 cases detected daily was modelized to fit with the last known data in France and extrapolated for the coming days using two scenarios following the existing data in China (best scenario) and Italy (worst scenario). The number of daily admissions in ICU was calculated as the sum of 13.7% of the new Covid19 cases detected on a given day and 7.8% of the average of the total new Covid-19 cases recorded in the last week. Approximately 39.7% of patients admitted to the ICU were non-intubated with an average ICU length of stay of 4 days. Conversely, 60.3% of patients were intubated and for those who died among them (14.44%) the ICU length of stay was of 4 days for 78.3% of them and of 15 days for 21.7% of them. For the intubated patients that were discharged alive, the ICU length of stay was of 6 days for 44.4% of them and of 20 days for 55.6% of them. RESULTS: We predict a peak of between 7072 and 8043 patients for the overall French territory. CONCUSION: Despite a simplified mathematical model, the strength of our study is a narrow possible range of predicted total number of ICU patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"CIVIDJIAN, A.; Wallet, F.; Guichon, C.; Martin, O.; Couray-Targe, S.; Thomas, R.; Wey, P.-F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.20056226v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units","ICU","Hospices Civils de Lyon"],"locations":["France","China"],"keyphrases":["number of Covid19 patients","ICU length of stay","average ICU length","intubated patients","Covid19 ICU patient turnover","number of new Covid19 cases","narrow possible range of predicted total number of ICU patients","coming days","number of daily admissions","existing data","official data","internal data","known data","France","total new Covid","best scenario","worst scenario","simplified mathematical model","China","Intensive Care Units","strength","study","Italy","scenarios","recurrence relation","Hospices Civils","given day","METHODS","CONCUSION","Lyon","overall French territory","breaking point","formula","order","peak","INTRODUCTION","sum","RESULTS","week"],"language":"en"},

A standardized definition would be helpful to pool data across studies, allow for between-study comparisons, and ultimately work toward developing clinical guidelines. Purpose To define early functional rehabilitation (including when it is initiated and what it entails) when used to treat Achilles tendon rupture and to identify outcome measures for evaluating the effect of treatment. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant studies. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies consisted of randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series (\u226510 participants) including weightbearing or exercise-based interventions within 8 weeks after Achilles tendon rupture. Results A total of 174 studies published between 1979 and 2018 were included. Studies were rated a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 17 (15-20) on the Downs \u0026 Black checklist and included 9098 participants. Early functional rehabilitation incorporated weightbearing (95%), range of motion (73%), and isometric/strengthening exercises (50%). Weightbearing was initiated within the first week, whereas exercise (eg, ankle range of motion, strengthening, whole-body conditioning) was initiated in the second week. Initiation of exercises varied based on whether treatment was nonsurgical (mean, 3.0 weeks; IQR, 2.0-4.0 weeks) or simple (mean, 2.0 weeks; IQR, 0.0-2.3 weeks) or augmented surgical repair (mean, 0.5 weeks; IQR, 0.0-2.8 weeks) (P = .017). Functional outcomes including ankle range of motion (n = 84) and strength (n = 76) were reported in 130 studies. Other outcome domains included patient-reported outcomes (n = 89), survey-based functional outcomes (n = 50), and tendon properties (n = 53). Conclusion Early functional rehabilitation includes weightbearing and a variety of exercise-based interventions initiated within the first 2 weeks after acute Achilles tendon rupture/repair. Because early functional rehabilitation has lacked a standardized definition, interventions and outcome measures are highly variable, and pooling data across studies should be done with attention paid to what was included in the intervention and how treatment was assessed.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zellers, Jennifer A; Christensen, Marianne; Kj\u00E6r, Inge Lunding; Rathleff, Michael Skovdal; Silbernagel, Karin Gr\u00E4vare","journal":"Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967119884071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Achilles","PEDro","Weightbearing"],"organizations":["Downs \u0026 Black"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weeks","Functional outcomes","cohort studies","Early functional rehabilitation incorporated weightbearing","relevant studies","IQR","acute Achilles tendon rupture","exercise-based interventions","mean","ankle range of motion","tendon properties","outcome measures","standardized definition","interquartile range","variety of exercise","consistent definition","outcome domains","participants","effect of treatment","pool data","surgical repair","pooling data","study comparisons","Initiation of exercises","Study Design Systematic review","PEDro","randomized controlled trials","EMBASE","CINAHL","Cochrane databases","Level of evidence","case series","Methods Ovid MEDLINE","patient","median","survey","Black checklist","Conclusion","Purpose","whole-body conditioning","Eligibility criteria","Downs","literature","efficacy","strength","Background","clinical guidelines","isometric","total","attention"],"language":"en"},

In the general population, higher potassium intake is considered protective for cardiovascular health. Due to the risk of hyperkalemia in CKD, limiting potassium intake is often recommended. However, given that poor cardiovascular function can cause kidney damage, following a low-potassium diet may be deleterious for patients with CKD. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on dietary potassium intake and CKD progression. Multiple databases were searched on 7 June 2019 and data were managed with Covidence. No intervention trials met the inclusion criteria. Eleven observational studies met the inclusion criteria (10 post hoc analyses, 1 retrospective cohort), representing 49,573 stage 1-5 predialysis patients with CKD from 41 different countries. Of the 11 studies, 6 studies reported exclusively on early CKD (stage 1-2), 4 studies separately reported analyses on both early and late (stage 3-5) CKD, and 2 studies reported exclusively on late CKD. A total of 9 studies reported risk of disease progression in early CKD; in 4 studies high potassium intake was associated with lower risk, while in 2 studies the low intake showed a higher progression of risk, and 3 studies reported no relation. In late CKD, results are mixed: 2 studies suggested benefit of higher potassium intake and 1 suggested benefit of lower potassium intake, whereas 3 studies were neutral. These results should be interpreted with caution, as considerations preventing firm conclusions include 1) the overall low range of dietary potassium intake, with all studies reporting an average intake below the 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives guidelines, and 2) the method used to assess potassium intake in most studies (i.e., urine) in late stages of CKD. Ideally, well-controlled intervention studies are needed to understand how dietary potassium intake is linked to CKD progression.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Picard, Kelly; Barreto Silva, Maria Ines; Mager, Diana; Richard, Caroline","journal":"Advances in nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmaa027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CKD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies high potassium intake","CKD progression","late CKD","early CKD","observational studies","low intake","benefit of higher potassium intake","average intake","late stages of CKD","suggested benefit of lower potassium intake","overall low range of dietary potassium intake","low-potassium diet","well-controlled intervention studies","risk of disease progression","higher progression of risk","reported analyses","lower risk","dietary interventions","risk of hyperkalemia","kidney damage","prevalence of chronic kidney disease","inclusion criteria","results","Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives guidelines","predialysis patients","cardiovascular health","intervention trials","poor cardiovascular function","evidence","firm conclusions","caution","general population","urine","different countries","systematic review","considerations","strategy","retrospective cohort","method","aim","total","Multiple databases","Covidence","burden","relation"],"language":"en"},

However, due to the performance deterioration over time, its robustness and reliability appear not sufficient to allow a non-expert to use outside laboratory. It would be thus helpful to study what happens behind the decreasing tendency of the BCI performance. This paper explores the changes of brain networks and electrooculography (EOG) signals to investigate the cognitive capability changes along the use of the SSVEP-based BCI. The EOG signals are characterized by the blink amplitudes and the speeds of saccades, and the brain networks are estimated by the instantaneous phase synchronizations of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Experimental results revealed that the characteristics derived from EOG and brain networks have similar trends which contain two stages. At the beginning, the blink amplitudes and the saccade speeds start to reduce. Meanwhile, the global synchronizations of the brain networks are formed quickly. These observations implies that the cognitive decline along the use of the SSVEP-based BCI. Then, the EOG and the brain networks related characteristics demonstrate a slow recovery or relatively stable trend. This study could be helpful for a better understanding about the depreciation of the BCI performance as well as its relationship with the brain networks and the EOG along the use of the SSVEP-based BCI.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Yufan; Wang, Ze; Wong, Chi Man; Nan, Wenya; da Rosa, Agostinho Cl\u00E1udio; Xu, Peng; Wan, Feng; Hu, Yong","journal":"Journal of neural engineering","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ab933e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408272/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCI","EOG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCI performance","changes of brain networks","SSVEP-based BCI","brain networks related characteristics","EOG signals","based brain computer interface","popular BCI paradigm","high performance","performance deterioration","blink amplitudes","study","cognitive capability changes","cognitive decline","speeds of saccades","global synchronizations","saccade speeds","instantaneous phase synchronizations of electroencephalography","slow recovery","steady-state visual evoked potential","robustness","EEG","similar trends","electrooculography","little user training","time","better understanding","depreciation","decreasing tendency","relationship","non-expert","reliability","stable trend","paper","laboratory","stages","Experimental results","observations","beginning"],"language":"en"},

Biosimilars, which are biotechnologically manufactured products the same as reference biologicals, have actually now achieved a substantial proportion of the market in some regions but there are still doubters among patients and physicians who fear a loss of quality even if there is no evidence for this. A part of this problem can be explained by the nocebo effect but which furthermore also has a substantial medical importance. This effect is described and explained in this article. Psychosocial and context-related factors, such as the relationship between patient and physician, previous experience with treatment and treatment expectations can either improve or impair the efficacy of treatment interventions. These phenomena are commonly known as placebo and nocebo effects. As placebo and nocebo effects can influence the development of symptoms, the frequency of undesired events and the efficacy of treatment, it is decisive to know these effects and to develop strategies for prevention in order to optimize the treatment results. Although in recent years experimental studies have achieved substantial progress in the clarification of the psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms of placebo effects, detailed mechanisms of nocebo effects are still widely unexplored.

Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection while on these agents in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians. METHODS A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring. RESULTS Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications. The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications. In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried. The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for acute infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering. CONCLUSIONS The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families. Consideration of an individual\u0027s adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Sean D; Mathur, Anubhav N; Chiu, Yvonne E; Brandling-Bennett, Heather A; Pope, Elena; Siegel, Michael P; Holland, Kristen E; Paller, Amy S; Siegfried, Elaine C; Tom, Wynnis L; Lara-Corrales, Irene; Tollefson, Megha M; Maguiness, Sheilagh; Eichenfield, Lawrence F; Sugarman, Jeffrey; Frieden, Ilona J; Oza, Vikash S; Cipriano, Sarah D; Huang, Jennifer T; Shah, Sonal D; Lauren, Christine T; Castelo-Soccio, Leslie; McMahon, Patrick; Cordoro, Kelly M","journal":"Pediatric dermatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["certain immunosuppressive medications","laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy","management of systemic immunosuppressive therapies","Pediatric Dermatology COVID","pandemic","biologic medications","frequency of laboratory monitoring","majority of pediatric dermatologists","primary domains of systemic therapy","initiation","continuation","continuing therapy","PDCRTF","consideration","exception of systemic steroids","risk of exposure","expert opinion","expert panel","household exposure","ultimate decision","acute infection","patient of tapering","asymptomatic patients","evidence-based manner","little evidence available","careful deliberation","approach","Response Task Force","current practice","preventive measures","dermatologic indications","risks","individual\u0027s adherence","concerns","discussion","agents","children","popular choice","questions","dermatological disease","SARS-CoV","potential severity","time-sensitive guidance","clinicians","survey","families","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","absence of data","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","respondents","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We examined the long-term effects of sheet materials using an animal pleural defect model. METHODS Beagles were used for this study. The 5-mm circular pleural defects were created at 2 sites on each of the anterior, medial, and posterior lobe and repaired using a 2 cm square sheet material. The frequency of adhesion of those sheets to the thoracic walls and histological changes was examined after 6 months. In this study, three types of sheet materials were examined: polyglycolic acid, nano-polyglycolic acid, and oxidized regenerated cellulose where each sheet was tested with or without coating with fibrin glue, for a total of 6 groups. Each group contained an equal number of defect sites and evaluation of 12 defect sites was conducted. RESULTS Adhesion was observed in 16 of 72 sites (22%). Presence or absence of adhesion was not affected by the repair method or by the type of sheet material used. However, the use of fibrin glue significantly reduced the occurrence of adhesion (p = 0.023). At the defected sites, the posterior lobe showed significantly less adhesion (p = 0.019). Histologically, the sheet materials caused a thickening of the pleural wall 6-10 times thicker than the normal pleural wall. CONCLUSION No statistically significant differences regarding the presence or absence of adhesion to the thoracic wall were found among the sheet materials. The use of fibrin glue significantly reduced the adhesion to the thoracic wall.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanai, Eiichi; Matsutani, Noriyuki; Aso, Tatsuya; Yamamoto, Yasuto; Sakai, Takashi","journal":"General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-019-01270-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RESULTS Adhesion"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of adhesion","types of sheet materials","type of sheet material","occurrence of adhesion","square sheet material","frequency of adhesion","RESULTS Adhesion","long-term effects of sheet materials","normal pleural wall","defected sites","circular pleural defects","use of fibrin glue","animal pleural defect model","equal number of defect sites","posterior lobe","thoracic walls","Presence","study","nano-polyglycolic acid","repair method","evaluation","times thicker","oxidized regenerated cellulose","sheets","histological changes","significant differences","thickening","excellent pressure resistance","total","coating","CONCLUSION","months","METHODS Beagles","OBJECTIVE","groups"],"language":"en"},

Given the absence of a current vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, it is urgent to search for FDA-approved drugs that can potentially inhibit essential viral enzymes. The inhibition of 3CLpro has potential medical application, due to the fact that it is required for processing of the first translated replicase polyproteins into a series of native proteins, which are essential for viral replication in the host cell. We employed an in silico approach to test if disulfiram, as well as its metabolites, and captopril could be used as potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19.

We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals).

This paper examines the legal implications of such decisions. It takes up arguments from the general discussion on prioritization in medicine. A constitutional hurdle for the application of utilitarian criteria (in particular patients\u0027 age or social role) comes from the principle that every human life is of equal value and must not be traded off against others (\u0022life value indifference\u0022). However, the limits that the Grundgesetz (German Basic Law) sets for state actions do not apply directly to doctors. According to the Musterberufsordnung (professional code of conduct), doctors act based on their conscience and the requirements of medical ethics and humanity. The implications of this normative standard for the prioritizing in an exceptional situation as the COVID 19 pandemic have not been sufficiently clarified.

This basin is one of the most severe cases of water pollution in Latin America and metals like lead represent the most common chemical pollutants. Rats were trapped in nine sites with different soil and water lead concentrations, between 2014 and 2015. A positive relationship was found between lead concentration in the liver and kidney of R. norvegicus and the environmental concentration of this metal in water and soil. Although the remaining variables analyzed were also related to the lead concentration in soft tissues, they did not affect the association between the lead concentration in soft tissues and that in the environment. The lead concentration in the stomach contents was not related to any of the variables analyzed.

Recognising that there are unique aspects of veterinary practice in certain geographical regions of the world, the Vaccination Guidelines Group undertook a regional project in Latin America between 2016 and 2019, culminating in the present document. The Vaccination Guidelines Group gathered scientific and demographic data during visits to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, by discussion with national key opinion leaders, visiting veterinary practices and review of the scientific literature. A questionnaire survey was completed by 1390 veterinarians in five Latin American countries and the Vaccination Guidelines Group delivered continuing education at seven events attended by over 3500 veterinarians. The Vaccination Guidelines Group recognised numerous challenges in Latin America, for example: (1) lack of national oversight of the veterinary profession, (2) extraordinary growth in private veterinary schools of undetermined quality, (3) socioeconomic constraints on client engagement with preventive health care, (4) high regional prevalence of some key infectious diseases (e.g. feline leukaemia virus infection, canine visceral leishmaniosis), (5) almost complete lack of minimal antigen vaccine products as available in other markets, (6) relative lack of vaccine products with extended duration of immunity as available in other markets, (7) availability of vaccine products withdrawn from other markets (e.g. Giardia vaccine) or unique to Latin America (e.g. some Leishmania vaccines), (8) accessibility of vaccines directly by pet owners or breeders such that vaccination is not delivered under veterinary supervision, (9) limited availability of continuing education in veterinary vaccinology and lack of compulsion for continuing professional development and (10) limited peer-reviewed published scientific data on small companion animal infectious diseases (with the exception of leishmaniosis) and lack of support for such academic research. In this document, the Vaccination Guidelines Group summarises the findings of this project and assesses in evidence-based fashion the scientific literature pertaining to companion animal vaccine-preventable diseases in Latin America. The Vaccination Guidelines Group makes some recommendations on undergraduate and postgraduate education and academic research. Recognising that current product availability in Latin America does not permit veterinarians in these countries to vaccinate according to the global World Small Animal Veterinary Association guidelines, the Vaccination Guidelines Group makes a series of \u0022pragmatic\u0022 recommendations as to what might be currently achievable, and a series of \u0022aspirational\u0022 recommendations as to what might be desirable for the future. The concept of \u0022vaccine husbandry\u0022 is addressed via some simple guidelines for the management of vaccine products in the practice. Finally, the Vaccination Guidelines Group emphasises the global trend towards delivery of vaccination as one part of an \u0022annual health check\u0022 or \u0022health care plan\u0022 that reviews holistically the preventive health care needs of the individual pet animal. Latin American practitioners should transition towards these important new practices that are now well embedded in more developed veterinary markets. The document also includes 70 frequently asked questions and their answers; these were posed to the Vaccination Guidelines Group during our continuing education events and small group discussions and should address many of the issues surrounding delivery of vaccination in the Latin American countries.

Yet, there is little evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants to treat depression with concomitant frailty. To better understand this issue, we examined the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression and then considered implications for frailty. METHODS Due to the absence of therapeutic studies of frail older adults with depression, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized controlled trials that compared antidepressants versus placebo for adults with depression, age 65 years or older. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, reference lists from meta-analyses/studies, hand searches of publication lists, and related articles on PubMed. Outcomes included rates of response, remission, and adverse events. After evaluating the data, we applied a frailty-informed framework to consider how the evidence could be applied to frailty. RESULTS Nine trials were included in the meta-analysis (n = 2704). Subjects had moderate to severe depression. For older adults with depression, there was no statistically significant difference in response or remission to second-generation antidepressants compared to placebo. Response occurred in 45.3% of subjects receiving an antidepressant compared to 40.5% receiving placebo (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37, p = 0.12, I2 = 71%). Remission occurred in 33.1% with antidepressant versus 31.3% with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.92 - 1.31, p = 0.30, I2 = 56%) (Figure 2 and 3). There were more withdrawals due to adverse events with antidepressants, 13% versus 5.8% (RR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.45-3.63; p \u003C 0.001; I2 = 61%; NNH 14, 95% CI:10-28). IMPLICATIONS FOR FRAILTY Subjects in the meta-analysis did not have obvious characteristics of frailty. Using framework questions to consider the implications of frailty, we hypothesize that, like older adults, frail individuals with depression may not respond to antidepressants. Further, observational studies suggest that those who are frail may be less responsive to antidepressants compared to the non-frail. Given the vulnerability of frailty, adverse events may be more burdensome. CONCLUSIONS Second-generation antidepressants have uncertain benefit for older adults with depression and cause more adverse events compared to placebo. Until further research clarifies benefit, careful consideration of antidepressant prescribing with frailty is warranted.","publish_time":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mallery, Laurie; MacLeod, Tanya; Allen, Michael; McLean-Veysey, Pamela; Rodney-Cail, Natasha; Bezanson, Evan; Steeves, Brian; LeBlanc, Constance; Moorhouse, Paige","journal":"BMC geriatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-019-1327-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FRAILTY Subjects","implications of frailty","safety of antidepressants","treatment of older adults","BACKGROUND Frail older adults","prescribed antidepressants","placebo","vulnerability of frailty","concomitant frailty","safety of second-generation antidepressants","severe depression","CONCLUSIONS Second-generation antidepressants","absence of therapeutic studies of frail older adults","adverse events","frailty-informed framework","CI","obvious characteristics of frailty","remission","frail individuals","I2","RR","meta-analysis of double-blind","meta-analyses","observational studies","efficacy","rates of response","PubMed","careful consideration of antidepressant","reference lists","uncertain benefit","little evidence","framework questions","randomized controlled trials","hand searches of publication lists","Cochrane Library","cause","MEDLINE","systematic review","age","related articles","significant difference","years","research","Outcomes","withdrawals","METHODS","NNH","issue","RESULTS","Figure","data"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This case series is about three patients who presented to the emergency department of a community hospital in Montpellier, France, with acute abdominal pain. RESULTS The three patients had an elevated C-reactive protein level. CT scans demonstrated no abdominal anomaly, but bilateral lung lesions at the lung bases, typical of COVID-19 lesions, were observed. COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were positive for the three patients.The patients were transferred to the COVID-19 centre for disease control at Montpellier University Hospital. As of 29 March 2020, two of those patients are still intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the third was discharged home.

Mode of delivery influences VTE risk, with emergency caesarean section (CS) associated with the highest risk (CS). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for selected women to reduce the risk of VTE. We aimed to investigate the impact of mode of delivery and thromboprophylaxis on hypercoagulability as measured by thromboelastometry (TEM) and thrombin generation (TG) in women at high VTE risk. Materials and Methods Blood was collected from 99 pregnant women with VTE risk factors at up to five time points from pre- (T1) and post (T2)-delivery to 6 weeks postpartum (T5). Multiple linear regression was utilised to compare TG and TEM between those with vaginal delivery (VD) and CS at each time point. Paired sample t -test with post hoc Bonferroni correction was utilised to compare laboratory markers over time. Results Women in both groups had a median of three postpartum VTE risk factors, with higher body mass index and parity post-VD. In both the groups, TG and TEM parameters suggested hypercoagulability at T2 compared with T1, with resolution at T5. There were minimal differences between groups, apart from T2 with shorter clot formation time and higher maximum clot firmness in the VD group. Conclusion TG and TEM illustrate hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy and delivery. The pattern of postpartum hypercoagulability seen in women with VTE risk factors was similar irrespective of mode of delivery. Further research is required to establish the effect of labour on TG/TEM in the absence of low molecular weight heparin use.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guimicheva, Boriana; Roberts, Lara N; Patel, Jignesh P; Subramanian, Devi; Arya, Roopen","journal":"TH open : companion journal to thrombosis and haemostasis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3402807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31915751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TG","CS","TEM","TG/TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of VTE","postpartum VTE risk factors","high VTE risk","Mode of delivery influences VTE risk","highest risk","greatest risk postpartum","vaginal delivery","pregnant women","T2","TEM parameters","selected women","Results Women","pattern of postpartum hypercoagulability","CS","Conclusion TG","groups","time points","weeks postpartum","shorter clot formation time","VD group","T1","impact of mode","Thromboprophylaxis","T5","parity post-VD","higher maximum clot firmness","higher body mass index","emergency caesarean section","absence of low molecular weight heparin use","median","significant cause of maternal mortality","thromboelastometry","thrombin generation","Bonferroni correction","Paired sample t -test","Methods Blood","laboratory markers","effect of labour","Introduction Venous thromboembolism","resolution","pregnancy","Multiple linear regression","minimal differences","Materials","research"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. Study design Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. Results In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group vs. 2/37 (5.4%) vs. (3/244 (1.2%), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20%) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. Conclusion The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6%).

Objective: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing morbidities among COVID-19 infected patients and their mortality risks against each type of pre-existing morbidity categories. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Data sources: Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using the following keywords: (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or Coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2) AND (Comorbidity or Morbidity) AND (Mortality or Death or Died) up to May 01, 2020. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned pre-print servers (e.g., medRxiv, bioRixv, SSRN), and relevant journal websites. Eligibility criteria: Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs. non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors against types of pre-existing morbidities. Methods: Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 42 studies included in this study comprised of 39,398 samples. The most common pre-existing morbidities in COVID-19 infected patients were hypertension (36.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.9%), and diabetes (22.0%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular system diseases (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 2.79-3.95), immune and metabolic disorders (OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 2.00-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26), cerebrovascular system diseases (OR: 4.12, 95% CI: 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63-3.03), renal (OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 2.60-3.52), and liver system diseases (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.21-1.71). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a higher likelihood of deaths among COVID-19 patients against morbidity categories. These findings could potentially help healthcare providers to sort out the most endangered COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, M.; Khan, M.

We hypothesised that if patients treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) were more prone to SARS-CoV2 infection and had a worse prognosis than untreated patients, the prevalence of consumption of these drugs would be higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to the general population. Methods and results: We used a clinical epidemiology approach based on the estimation of standardised prevalence ratio (SPR) of consumption of ACEI and ARB in four groups of patients (including 187 COVID-19 positive) with increasing severity referred to the University hospital of Lille and in three French reference samples (the exhaustive North population (n=1,569,968), a representative sample of the French population (n=414,046), a random sample of Lille area (n=1,584)). The SPRs of ACEI and ARB did not differ as the severity of the COVID-19 patients increased, being similar to the regular consumption of these drugs in the North of France population with the same non-significant increase for both treatment (1.17 [0.83-1.67]). A statistically significant increase in the SPR of ARB (1.56 [1.02-2.39]) was observed in intensive care unit patients only. After stratification on obesity, this increase was limited to the high risk subgroup of obese patients. Conclusions: Our results strongly support the recommendation that ACEI and ARB should be continued in the population and in COVID-19 positive patients, reinforcing the position of several scientific societies.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dauchet, L.; Lambert, M.; Gauthier, V.; Poissy, J.; Faure, K.; Facon, A.; Yelnik, C.; Panaget, S.; Plagnieux, T.; Verfaillie, F.; Mathieu, D.; Goldstein, P.; Meirhaeghe, A.; Amouyel, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20078071v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARB","COVID","ACEI","University","Lille","SPR"],"locations":["France","North"],"keyphrases":["positive patients","untreated patients","groups of patients","French population","consumption of ACEI","SPR of ARB","prognosis of COVID","general population","intensive care unit patients","exhaustive North population","North of France population","prevalence of consumption","SPRs of ACEI","high risk subgroup of obese patients","regular consumption","non-significant increase","results","worse prognosis","random sample of Lille area","increasing severity","representative sample","renin angiotensin aldosterone system drugs","French reference samples","University hospital of Lille","SARS-CoV2 infection","estimation of standardised prevalence ratio","incidence","AT1 receptor blockers","ACE inhibitors","question of interactions","clinical epidemiology approach","position","treatment","recommendation","scientific societies","stratification","obesity","medical community","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Our aim in this study was to evaluate the contents of the most frequently viewed YouTube videos during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: In this study, contents of the most frequently viewed Turkish and English videos regarding COVID-19 pandemics are examined and scored with modified DISCERN, MICI and VPI. Results: The mean DISCERN score of Turkish videos is similar to English videos (2.55 and 2.43 respectively).

It rapidly spread to the rest of the world, and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30th of January 2020. Our understanding of the virus, it is clinical manifestations and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. Objective: This review sought to summarise the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management and trials, and performed a systematic review of reported clinical data on COVID-19. Synthesis methods: Two reviewers selected all the literature independently, and extracted information according to pre-defined topics. Results: COVID-19 is pandemic with ~4 million cases and 270,000 deaths in 210 countries as of 8 May 2020. Our review of reports showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had an incubation period of four to six days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (80%) and cough (60%) across the spectrum of clinical disease - mild, moderate, severe and critical. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management need to be well defined considering the age of the patient and the presence of underlying co-morbidities. The case definitions we reviewed varied among affected countries, which could have contributed to the differences observed in the mean case fatality rates among continents: Oceania (1%), Asia (3%), Africa (4%), South America (5%), North America (6%) and Europe (10%). Asymptomatic cases, which constituted an estimated 80% of COVID-19 cases are a huge threat to control efforts. Conclusion: The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant a COVID-19 testing but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is important for managing, treating and tracking clinical illness. While several treatments are in development or in clinical trials for COVID-19, home care of mild/moderate cases and hospital care for severe and critical cases remain the recommended management for the disease.

However, a systematic and comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profile across multiple organs of normal human adults has been pending. Results we performed single-cell transcriptomes of 88,622 cells derived from 15 tissue organs of one adult donor and generated an adult human cell atlas (AHCA). The AHCA depicted 234 subtypes of cells, including major cell types such as T, B, myeloid, epithelial, and stromal cells, as well as novel cell types in skin, each of which was distinguished by multiple marker genes and transcriptional profiles and collectively contributed to the heterogeneity of major human organs. Moreover, TCR and BCR repertoire comparison and trajectory analyses revealed direct clonal sharing of T and B cells with various developmental states among different tissues. Furthermore, novel cell markers, transcription factors and ligand-receptor pairs were identified with potential functional regulations on maintaining the homeostasis of human cells among tissues. Conclusions The AHCA reveals the inter- and intra-organ heterogeneity of cell characteristics and provides a useful resource to uncover key events during the development of human diseases such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the context of heterogeneity of cells and organs.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Shuai; Wang, Lin-he; Liu, Yang; Li, Yi-qi; Chen, Haitian; Xu, Jinghong; Peng, Wan; Lin, Guo-Wang; Wei, Pan-Pan; Li, Bo; Xia, Xiaojun; Wang, Dan; Bei, Jin-Xin; He, Xiaoshun; Guo, Zhiyong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.996975","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHCA","BCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homeostasis of human cells","B cells","stromal cells","subtypes of cells","cells of various types","adult human cell atlas","heterogeneity of major human organs","novel cell types","major cell types","novel cell markers","single-cell transcriptomes","homeostasis of human body","multiple organs of normal human adults","intra-organ heterogeneity of cell characteristics","development of human diseases","tissue organs","AHCA","comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profile","different tissues","context of heterogeneity","core units of organ tissues","transcriptional profiles","adult donor","various developmental states","multiple marker genes","direct clonal sharing of T","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","trajectory analyses","transcription factors","ligand-receptor pairs","BCR repertoire comparison","key events","regulatory networks","biological mechanisms","potential functional regulations","useful resource","harmonious rhythms","TCR","COVID","Background","health","skin","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The pandemic of this virus has caused a high number of deaths in the world. In order to more efficiently combat this pandemic, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the initial attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. In this study, we used glycan microarray technology to study the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) to HS and sialic acid. Our results indicated that the S protein can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner and the length of HS appears not to be a critical factor for the binding. No binding with sialic acid residues was detected. In addition, we applied sequence alignment and molecular docking to analyze and explain the observed binding results. Our results suggested that HS may stabilize the open conformation of the S protein to promote the subsequent binding of the S protein to the virus entry receptor ACE2. Overall, this work supports the potential importance of HS in SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the development of antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Wei; Ma, Bo; Li, Ziheng; Wang, Xiaoyu; Gao, Xiaopan; Li, Yaohao; Qin, Bo; Shang, Shiying; Cui, Sheng; Tan, Zhongping","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61950e0f01bc6240f951a255a606eac456e35f89.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein","length of HS","spike protein","SARS-CoV","subsequent binding","observed binding results","potential importance of HS","sialic acid residues","Infection","study","pandemic","virus entry receptor ACE2","novel coronavirus","human coronavirus","heparan sulfate","cell-surface glycans","proteoglycans","sulfation-dependent manner","sequence alignment","initial attachment","glycan microarray technology","open conformation","high number of deaths","molecular docking","better understanding","world","work","oligosaccharides","development of antiviral agents","host cells","critical factor","addition","order"],"language":"en"},

The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood oxygen and coagulation function. The cohort is characterized with increasing cumulative incidences of severe progression up to 10 days after admission. Competing risks survival model incorporating CT imaging and baseline information showed an improved performance for predicting severity onset (mean time-dependent AUC = 0.880). Conclusions: Multiple predisposition factors can be utilized to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions at an early stage.

ELIGIBLE DATA: Countries and US states or major cities with at least 250 COVID-19 deaths as of 4/4/2020 and with information available on death counts according to age strata, allowing to calculate the number of deaths in people with age \u003C65. Data were available for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, as well as Louisiana, Michigan, Washington states and New York City as of April 4, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths that occur in people \u003C65 years old; relative risk of COVID-19 death in people \u003C65 versus \u226565 years old; absolute risk of death in people \u003C65 and in those \u226580 years old in the general population as of 4/4/2020; absolute death risk expressed as equivalent of death risk from driving a motor vehicle. RESULTS: Individuals with age \u003C65 account for 5%-9% of all COVID-19 deaths in the 8 European epicenters, and approach 30% in three US hotbed locations. People \u003C65 years old had 34- to 73-fold lower risk than those \u226565 years old in the European countries and 13- to 15-fold lower risk in New York City, Louisiana and Michigan. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death ranged from 1.7 per million for people \u003C65 years old in Germany to 79 per million in New York City. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people \u226580 years old ranged from approximately 1 in 6,000 in Germany to 1 in 420 in Spain. The COVID-19 death risk in people \u003C65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 9 miles per day (Germany) and 415 miles per day (New York City). People \u003C65 years old and not having any underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.3%, 0.7%, and 1.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in Netherlands, Italy, and New York City. CONCLUSIONS: People \u003C65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in the hotbeds of the pandemic and deaths for people \u003C65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ioannidis, John P.

The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive. Methods: Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. Results: A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (\u003C20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (\u226560 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly \u226560 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jing, Qin-Long; Liu, Ming-Jin; Yuan, Jun; Zhang, Zhou-Bin; Zhang, An-Ran; Dean, Natalie E; Luo, Lei; Ma, Meng-Meng; Longini, Ira; Kenah, Eben; Lu, Ying; Ma, Yu; Jalali, Neda; Fang, Li-Qun; Yang, Zhi-Cong; Yang, Yang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20056010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAR"],"locations":["Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["household contacts","household SAR","household transmissibility of SARS","primary cases","SARS-CoV","household transmission","household setting","Guangzhou","years old","mean incubation period","uninfected close contacts","MERS-CoV","global reported number of COVID","infectivity of COVID","maximum infectious period","population-level effective reproductive number","days","elderly","close relatives","isolation","risk of infection","odds of infection","case infected","individual-level secondary attack rate","tertiary","nonprimary","heightened restriction of human movement","comprehensive contact-tracing dataset","unrelated clusters","conjunction","households","children","total","gender difference","age effects","causative pathogen","Results","Methods","residential address","average","times","illness","Conclusion","pandemic","Background","deaths","week"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days. Result: Nine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7/9, 77.8%, P=0.09). Conclusion: In our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group.

We report the main features of the development of a novel freely accessible model intended to urgently help researchers and decision makers to predict the evolution of the pandemic in their country. Methods and findings We built a SIR-type compartmental model with additional compartments and features. We made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared to the population size. We introduced a compartment D corresponding to the deceased patients and a compartment L representing the group of individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody (due to social or medical isolation). Our model integrated a time-dependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by each country and a cosine function to incorporate a periodic weekly component linked to the way in which numbers of cases and deaths are counted and reported, which can change from day to day. The model was able to accurately capture the different changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for nine different countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures. The model provided very accurate forecasts in the relatively short term (10 days). Conclusions In early evaluation of the performance of our model, we found a high level of accuracy between prediction and observed data, regardless of the country. The model should be used by the community to help public health decisions as we will refine it over time and further investigate its performance.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavielle, M.; Faron, M.; lefevre, j.; Zeitoun, J.-D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d15a9e149b2e13259181f5060705ab57a727d988.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20104885v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accessible model","type of pandemic","country","SIR-type compartmental model","performance","public measures","spread","different changes","different countries","main features","group of individuals","population size","containment measures","compartment D corresponding","number of contagious individuals","high level of accuracy","public health decisions","time-dependent transmission rate","additional compartments","way","deceased patients","development","periodic weekly component","cosine function","short term","prediction","researchers","accurate forecasts","community","evolution","novel","dynamics","early evaluation","numbers of cases","decision makers","variations","Conclusions","hypothesis","findings","data","medical isolation","deaths","days","Methods","COVID","uncertainties","epidemiologic models"],"language":"en"},

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\u0026E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56) and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the viral particles in kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM). RESULTS 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p\u003C 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p\u003C 0.001, respectively). H\u0026E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. EM observation also demonstrated that viruses- like particles are visible in the kidneys. Viral infection not only induces CD68\u002B macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. The viruses not only have direct cytotoxicity, but also initiate CD68\u002B macrophage together with complement C5b-9 deposition to mediate tubular pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diao, Bo; Wang, Chenhui; Wang, Rongshuai; Feng, Zeqing; Tan, Yingjun; Wang, Huiming; Wang, Changsong; Liu, Liang; Liu, Ying; Liu, Yueping; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Ren, Liang; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5e95f2d09d207dfcc2133e846efe1318cfd84ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["Kidney tissues","CD68","human kidney tubules","acute renal failure","complement C5b","ARF","eldery patients","CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV","viruses","acute tubular damage","viral particles","severe acute tubular necrosis","NP antigen","tubular pathogenesis","heart failure","novel coronavirus","deposition","Viral infection","kidneys","COVID","vs","Wuhan","immunohistochemistry","E staining","EM observation","situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein","postmortems","immune cell markers","eGFR","retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate","CD8","comorbidities","Hematoxylin","lymphocyte infiltration","CD56","postmortem examinations","hypertension","Eosin","cases","clinical parameters","laboratory","outbreak","tubulointerstitium","transmission electronic microscope","emergency of major international concern","macrophages","BACKGROUND","nCoV","direct cytotoxicity","respiratory system","METHODS","China","hospital","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling has been reported to be causal in cytokine storm-associated pathology in several respiratory viral infections, however, the mechanisms by which IFN-I promotes disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that lack of deISGylation during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions, cytokine amplification, lung vascular leakage and death. This pathology requires T cells but not T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18. However, lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- or Usp18C61A mice which were dependent on Isg15. We further mechanistically demonstrate that interrupting the ISGylation/deISGylation circuit increases extracellular levels of ISG15 which is accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation to the lung. Importantly, neutrophil depletion reversed morbidity and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. In summary, we reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaabani, Namir; Zak, Jaroslav; Johnson, Jennifer L.; Huang, Zhe; Nguyen, Nhan; Lazar, Daniel C.; Vartabedian, Vincent F.; Honke, Nadine; Prinz, Marco; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter; Arimoto, Kei-ichiro; Zhang, Dong-Er; Catz, Sergio D.; Teijaro, John R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.039321","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extracellular ISG15","Usp18-deficient","lack of Usp18","persistent viral infection","cytokine amplification","severe respiratory viral infections","USP18 enzymatic-inactive","extracellular levels of ISG15","inflammatory pathology","extracellular release of ISG15","enzymatic function of Usp18","cytokine storm-associated pathology","severe immune pathology","Isg15-deficient mouse models","T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18","mortality","T cells","lack of deISGylation","disease pathogenesis","neutrophil depletion","neutrophil differentiation","Usp18C61A mice","inflammatory neutrophil accumulation","IFN","indicator of disease severity","myeloid cells","deISGylation circuit","prospective predictor of disease outcome","lung vascular leakage","hematological disruptions","therapeutic target","morbidity","pathological manifestations","poor prognosis","death","interferon","mechanisms","Type","production","results","summary"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy for COVID-19. Methods: We will conduct two nested multicenter international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) pre-emptive therapy (PET) for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 with a total symptom duration of less than 4 days. We will recruit 1500 patients for each the PEP and PET trials. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive 5 days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized; hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States. Discussion: These complementary randomized control trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted in order to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.

SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks\u0027 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. RESULTS LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. CONCLUSION A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perchetti, Garrett A; Nalla, Arun K; Huang, Meei-Li; Zhu, Haiying; Wei, Yulun; Stensland, Larry; Loprieno, Michelle A; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L","journal":"Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hanks\u0027 Balanced Salt Solution","PBS","HBSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VTM","CDCbased SARS-CoV","N2 gene target","target gene","analytical sensitivity of SARS","N1 gene target","modified CDC-based laboratory","PBS","test","stool","similar sensitivity","multiple specimen types","HBSS","range of sample types","N2 assay","CSF","reaction","copies","Initial limits of detection","cerebrospinal fluid","comparable LoDs","RESULTS LoDs","various respiratory secretions","cerebral spinal fluid","BACKGROUND Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","sputum","nasal swabs","viral transport medium","plasma","bronchoalveolar lavage","matrix effect","phosphate buffered saline","Hanks\u0027 Balanced Salt Solution","qRT-PCR","SARSCoV","wide tropism","CONCLUSION","Study Design","accuracy","mean CT cut-off","considerable disruption","world","OBJECTIVE","Alternatives","deaths"],"language":"en"},

We propose the following hypothesis: Imbalance in the action of ACE1- and ACE2-derived peptides, thereby enhancing Angiotensin-II (ANG II) signaling, a primary driver of COVID-19 pathobiology. ACE1/ACE2 imbalance occurs due to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, reducing ACE2-mediated conversion of ANG II to ANG peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ACE1-generated ANGII. This hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat COVID-19 by restoring ACE1/ACE2 balance: 1) ANG II receptor blockers (ARBs); 2) ACE1 inhibitors (ACEIs); 3) Agonists of receptors activated by ACE2-derived peptides [e.g., ANG (1-7), which activates MAS1]; 4) Recombinant human ACE2 or ACE2 peptides as decoys for the virus. Reducing ACE1/ACE2 imbalance is predicted to blunt COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable patients. Importantly, approved ARBs and ACEIs can be rapidly repurposed to test their efficacy in treating COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A","journal":"British journal of pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ANG II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 peptides","ACE2 imbalance","ACE2 balance","ACE2-derived peptides","ANG peptides","ACE2-mediated conversion of ANG","Recombinant human ACE2","action of ACE1","ACE1 inhibitors","pathophysiological effects of ACE1","primary driver of COVID","ACEIs","Angiotensin","coronavirus SARS-CoV","receptor blockers","approved ARBs","binding of SARS","following hypothesis","decoys","mortality","generated ANGII","associated morbidity","Agonists of receptors","pathobiology","vulnerable patients","MAS1","efficacy","approaches","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective single tertiary care centre 14-year cohort of patients with LVO in the anterior circulation and NIHSS score \u2264 5 on admission. Outcome was analysed according to primary intended therapy. RESULTS Among 185 patients (median age 67.4 years), 52.4% received primary conservative therapy (including 26.8% secondary reperfusion in case of secondary neurological deterioration), 12.4% IV thrombolysis (IVT) only and 35.1% primary endovascular therapy (EVT). 95 (51.4%) patients experienced neurological deterioration until 3 months. Primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT compared to conservative-therapy patients had better 3 months\u0027 outcome (54.5% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 6.02; adjustedp = 0.004 for mRS 0-1 and 54.7% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 5.09; adjustedp = 0.002, respectively). Also mRS shift analysis favored primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT patients (adjustedOR 6.25; adjustedp = 0.001 and adjustedOR 3.14; adjustedp = 0.003). Outcome in primary-IVT-only vs. primary-EVT patients did not differ significantly. Patients who received secondary EVT because of neurological deterioration after primary-conservative-therapy had worse 3 months\u0027 outcome than primary-EVT patients (20.8% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 0.24; adjustedp = 0.047 for mRS 0-1 and adjustedOR 0.31; adjustedp = 0.019 in mRS shift analysis). Survival and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage did not differ amongst groups. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that primary IVT and/or EVT may be better than primary conservative therapy in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation and low NIHSS score. Furthermore, primary EVT was better than secondary EVT in case of neurological deterioration. There is an unmet need for RCTs to find the optimal therapy for this patient group.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heldner, Mirjam R; Chaloulos-Iakovidis, Panagiotis; Panos, Leonidas; Volbers, Bastian; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Dobrocky, Tomas; Mordasini, Pasquale; El-Koussy, Marwan; Gralla, Jan; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; Mattle, Heinrich P; Jung, Simon","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09744-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LVO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary EVT","primary-EVT patients","Primary-IVT","primary IVT","primary-conservative","primary conservative therapy","primary intended therapy","primary endovascular therapy","conservative-therapy patients","secondary EVT","adjustedp","adjustedOR","optimal therapy","year cohort of patients","case of secondary neurological deterioration","BACKGROUND Optimal management of patients","case of neurological deterioration","LVO","months\u0027 outcome","mRS shift analysis","low NIHSS score","secondary reperfusion","anterior circulation","retrospective analysis","prospective single tertiary care centre","large vessel occlusion","median age","RCTs","years","symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage","IV thrombolysis","Survival","RESULTS","patient group","CONCLUSIONS","data","unmet need","aim","groups","METHODS","admission","study"],"language":"en"},

Several screening tests for dysphagia have been developed and are used in clinical practice to prevent dysphagia complications. The Gugging Swallowing Screen is 1 such screening test. It is suggested for use in the assessment of the ability of patients to swallow fluid and non-fluid foods separately. It also promotes effective communication between healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the validity and benefit of the Gugging Swallowing Screen. DESIGN This was a systematic review. DATA SOURCE We sourced data from electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korean studies Information Service System. REVIEW METHODS We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases. We included studies published in English and Korean up to November 2018 that pertained to the Gugging Swallowing Screen. We designed strategies that included Medical Subject Headings and keywords, such as \u0022dysphagia,\u0022 \u0022swallowing,\u0022 \u0022assessment,\u0022 \u0022screening,\u0022 and \u0022GUSS,\u0022 used alone or in combination. RESULTS Of the 297 studies that appeared in the search result, 219 articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers after duplicate studies were eliminated. Finally, 8 articles were included in this study. With regard to validity, the Gugging Swallowing Screen had a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99), a pooled specificity of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.74), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9381. With regard to benefit, early systematic dysphagia screening using Gugging Swallowing Screen performed by nurses reduced both screening time and pneumonia rate compared to the control group (p = 0.004). The incidence of X-ray-verified pneumonia was significantly lower in the Gugging Swallowing Screen group than in the clinical screening group (p \u02C2 0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of pneumonia compared to the value predicted using the 10 mL water swallowing test. CONCLUSIONS The Gugging Swallowing Screen is a reliable and sensitive tool for screening dysphagia. Early and systematic assessment can prevent aspiration and pneumonia. However, further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this tool.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ki Deok; Kim, Tae Hee; Lee, Seon Heui","journal":"International journal of nursing studies","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gugging Swallowing Screen","Ovid MEDLINE","Research Information Sharing Service","Information Service System","Medical Subject Headings"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gugging Swallowing Screen group","screening dysphagia","early systematic dysphagia screening","clinical screening group","screening time","screening tests","dysphagia complications","systematic assessment","incidence of pneumonia","BACKGROUND Dysphagia","pneumonia rate","systematic review of electronic databases","Korean studies Information Service System","ray-verified pneumonia","control group","benefit","validity","aspiration","regard","REVIEW METHODS","articles","confidence interval","Research Information Sharing Service","Ovid EMBASE","Ovid MEDLINE","ability of patients","DATA SOURCE","serious complications","sensitive tool","clinical practice","incidence of X","pooled sensitivity","pooled specificity","non-fluid foods","Cochrane Library","KoreaMed","nurses","stroke","Medical Subject Headings","increase","keywords","effective communication","healthcare providers","area","receiver","characteristic curve","mortality","length of hospitalization","strategies","search result","independent reviewers","value","CONCLUSIONS","significant difference","water","use","effectiveness","English","DESIGN","study","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","GUSS","combination"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival \u0026 traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. RESULTS Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days.

Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographic spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing COVID-19 community transmission risk over time for different locations.

While indicated for use only in adult populations, small studies have shown encouraging results in reducing pain in children with few, if any, adverse effects. This is reassuring from a clinical perspective, as we hope to highlight the available evidence and invite researchers to expand future studies. Through this review, we have identified significant gaps in the literature surrounding the safety and use of buprenorphine in the pediatric population. To our knowledge, there are no major studies investigating this subject, and it is our hope that future studies will explore the use of transdermal buprenorphine as an alternative pain management technique in pediatrics.

An \u0022Environmental Protection Interview (EPI)\u0022 is one of the campaign-style environmental governance methods that target local officials. In this paper, the causal relationship between the implementation of EPI and pollutant emission reduction was confirmed using the method of Time-Varying Difference-in-difference (Time-Varying DID) to compensate for endogeneity problem and ensure that the results are still valid after several robustness checks. Our regional heterogeneous analysis shows that the policy effects of EPI decrease from east to west in China and that they have different emission reduction effects on various types of pollutants. Unfortunately, the results also suggest that policy implementation only temporarily affects pollutant emission reduction, which could be attributed to the governance approaches of campaign-style enforcement according to the impact mechanism analysis. This paper implies that the EPI should be continued to be implemented in the future with some improvements on pollutant reduction mechanisms to ensure effective adoption.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yihang; Zhang, Xinlong; Wang, Yu","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09243-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Environmental Protection Interview","EPI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Campaign-style governance","pollutant emission reduction","campaign-style environmental governance methods","policy effects of EPI","implementation of EPI","field of environmental governance","governance approaches of campaign","pollutant reduction mechanisms","different emission reduction effects","policy implementation","regular governance policies","style enforcement","policy goals","results","Varying Difference","paper","Environmental Protection Interview","political methods","method of Time","Communist Party of China","impact mechanism analysis","regional heterogeneous analysis","defined tasks","various types of pollutants","east","local officials","improvements","effective adoption","causal relationship","Chinese government","shortcomings","west","future","robustness checks","endogeneity problem"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92-100%. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring.

RESULTS In addition to our Lichtheimia ornata case, 44 cases of human Lichtheimia were analyzed. Lichtheimia predominated in Europe (68.2%), followed by Asia (16%), and Africa (9%). The most common underlying condition was hematological malignancy (36.3%), followed by trauma/major surgery (27.3%), while diabetes mellitus was rare (11.4%). Site of infection was mostly skin and soft tissues (45.5%) and lung (25%), while relatively few cases were disseminated (13.6%) or rhinocerebral (11.4%). Mortality (36.4%) was mainly due to disseminated and rhinocerebral infections. CONCLUSION In contrast to Rhizopus, the most common agent of mucormycosis recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus, Lichtheimia infections were primarily associated with hematological malignancies and major skin barrier damage. Given the fact that classical rhinocerebral mucormycosis remains difficult to treat, independent of causative species, timely application of amphotericin B accessory to debridement may be required for patient survival.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Junling; Tsui, Clement; Li, Mengxing; Xiao, Kun; de Hoog, G Sybren; Verweij, Paul E; Cao, Yu; Lu, Hongguang; Jiang, Yanping","journal":"Mycopathologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11046-020-00451-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Lichtheimia"],"locations":["Europe","Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["Lichtheimia corymbifera","Lichtheimia ornata case","BACKGROUND Lichtheimia species","species-specific analysis of Lichtheimia infections","cases of human Lichtheimia","rhinocerebral infections","common agent of mucormycosis","respiratory infections","classical rhinocerebral mucormycosis","serious skin","diabetes mellitus","novel agent","major skin barrier damage","independent of causative species","hematological malignancies","immunocompromised patients","hematological malignancy","Site of infection","clinical data","Available data","major surgery","analysis of risk factors","common underlying condition","Mucorales","emerging opportunistic fungal pathogens","timely application of amphotericin B accessory","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipient","debridement","fatal rhino-orbital","Rhizopus","ramosa","addition","Established agents","soft tissues","contrast","RESULTS","literature","CONCLUSION","patient survival","trauma","METHODS","ribosomal region","lung","Europe","Asia","Africa","Mortality"],"language":"en"},

Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that focused on physical examination in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in post-surgery consultations has never been studied yet. Also, comparative analysis of the face-to-face and video-setting on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to examine the impact of video technology on the workings of assessments of post-surgery wounds and its limits. METHODS We recorded 22 post-operative video consultations and 17 post-operative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was informing the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen and the secondary purpose was checking on the patient\u0027s recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of Conversation Analysis. RESULTS The way in which an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (15 out of 17) involve wound showings in the context of which surgeons report their observations formatted with evidentials (\u0022looks neat\u0022) and subsequently assess what these observations imply or what can be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (3 out of 22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments in which diagnostic criteria like redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (\u0022I think\u0022, \u0022sounds\u2026 good\u0022) and evidentials are absent. Even in case of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may reside in questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the video technology on post-operative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians inquire and patients provide their own, \u0022lay\u0022 observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that in video consultations patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in case of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial. The findings are expected to be generalizable to other healthcare areas, e.g., dermatology, physiotherapy.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-Cov2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-Cov2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). METHODS When the SARS-Cov2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-Cov2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms which could be a manifestations of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea or vomiting. RESULTS We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) of 34 and 26 years of age with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-Cov-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care. CONCLUSION Our report suggests that XLA patients might present high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-Cov2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B cell response might be important, but not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is need of larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soresina, Annarosa; Moratto, Daniele; Chiarini, Marco; Paolillo, Ciro; Baresi, Giulia; Foc\u00E0, Emanuele; Bezzi, Michela; Baronio, Barbara; Giacomelli, Mauro; Badolato, Raffaele","journal":"Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRP","XLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-Cov2 infection","XLA patients","SARS-Cov2 search","SARS-Cov2 epidemic","outcome of SARS","recent SARS-Cov2 pandemic","surveillance protocol of patients","interstitial pneumonia","severe pneumonia","nasopharyngeal swab","IEI","fever","cough","X-linked agammaglobulinemia","need of mechanic ventilation","normal subjects","high risk","years of age","older age","oxygen ventilation","affected Italy","Coronavirus Disease","manifestations of COVID","B cell response","complete absence of B cells","conclusions","asymptomatic cases","peripheral blood","inborn errors of immunity","broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes","similar genetic immune defects","comorbidities","anorexia","symptoms","detection","BACKGROUND","elevation of CRP","ferritin","larger observational studies","COVID19","intensive care","evidence","death","immunoglobulin infusions","report","METHODS","threat","diarrhea"],"language":"en"},

We used the hybrid intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM) plus method, which combines open and laparoscopic surgery to treat incarcerated umbilical hernia in a severely obese patient. CASE PRESENTATION A 46-year-old man presented in our department with a chief complaint of a painful mass in the umbilical region. Incarcerated umbilical hernia was diagnosed on the basis of abdominal computed tomography, and the decision was made to perform emergency surgery. The patient was severely obese (body mass index, 53.8 kg/m2), and the incarcerated portion of the hernia was therefore first addressed by open surgery. As bowel resection was unnecessary, the risk of infection was considered low, and after direct closure of the hernia orifice, IPOM was performed laparoscopically using the hybrid IPOM plus method. CONCLUSION Among severely obese patients, first trocar insertion is difficult and the wound site tends to come under strain, meaning that simple closure of the hernia orifice results in a high recurrence rate. The hybrid IPOM plus method used in this case combines open surgery and laparoscopy and appears useful for treating uninfected incarcerated umbilical hernia in severely obese patients safely and with an anticipated low rate of postoperative recurrence.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yanari, Shingo; Suto, Takayuki; Fujiwara, Hisataka; Ariyoshi, Yu; Umemura, Akira; Sasaki, Akira","journal":"Surgical case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00845-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of incarcerated umbilical hernia","uninfected incarcerated umbilical hernia","obese patients","hybrid IPOM","open surgery","hernia orifice results","umbilical region","incarcerated portion","method","laparoscopic surgery","emergency surgery","high recurrence rate","anticipated low rate of postoperative recurrence","painful mass","simple closure","direct closure","CASE PRESENTATION","hybrid intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair","body mass index","trocar insertion","decision","laparoscopy","wound site","standard procedure","basis of abdominal computed tomography","department","risk of infection","year-old man","chief complaint","strain","m2","bowel resection","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, their effectiveness remains unclear. Moreover, we have a paucity of data regarding the use of theory in implementation studies with nurses, the causal processes-i.e. mechanisms of action-targeted by interventions to change nurses\u0027 behaviour in clinical practice, and the constituent components-i.e. behaviour change techniques-included in interventions. Thus, our objectives are threefold: (1) to examine the effectiveness of practitioner-level implementation interventions in changing nurses\u0027 behaviour in clinical practice; (2) to identify, in included studies, the type and degree of theory use, the mechanisms of action targeted by interventions and the behaviour change techniques constituting interventions and (3) to examine whether intervention effectiveness is associated with the use of theory or with specific mechanisms of action and behaviour change techniques. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review based on the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines. We will search six databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science) with no time limitation for experimental and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated practitioner-level implementation interventions aiming to change nurses\u0027 behaviour in clinical practice. We will also hand-search reference lists of included studies. We will perform screening, full-text review, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction independently with the Covidence systematic review software. We will assess the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro software. We will code included studies independently for theory use (Theory Coding Scheme), mechanisms of action (coding guidelines from Michie) and behaviour change techniques (Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1) with QSR International\u0027s NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Meta-analyses will be performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) software. Meta-regression analyses will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics software. DISCUSSION This review will inform knowledge users and researchers interested in designing, developing and evaluating implementation interventions to support nurses\u0027 behaviour change in clinical practice. Results will provide key insights regarding which causal processes-i.e. mechanisms of action-should be targeted by these interventions, and which constituent components-i.e. behaviour change techniques-should be included in these interventions to increase their effectiveness.

The mortality rate for critically ill patients is up to 60%, and thus, reducing the disease severity and case mortality is a top priority. Currently, cytokine storms are considered as the major cause of critical illness and death due to COVID-19. After systematical review of the literature, we propose that cross-reactive antibodies associated antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) may actually be the cause of cytokine storms. It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development. If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID-19.

METHODOLOGY Three hundred and eight patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups according to whether occlusal reduction was done or not (n=154). For all patients, root canal treatment was carried out in two visits without intracanal medication. Patients assessed their pain using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 6h, 12h 24h, 48h after the first visit (Postinstrumentation) and 6h and 12h following root canal filling (Postobturation). Patients, also, recorded their medication intake (Sham or analgesic) postinstrumentation and postobturation; patients initially received a sham capsule, but, if pain persisted, an analgesic was prescribed. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Friedman\u0027s test, Wilcoxon\u0027s rank test and Chi2 (\u03C72 ) test. The Relative Risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for binary data. RESULTS Occlusal reduction was associated with less pain intensity than no occlusal reduction at 12h and 24h postinstrumentation (p\u003C0.05). Pain intensity significantly and gradually decreased with both groups at all postinstrumentation and postobturation timepoints compared to preoperative pain (p\u003C0.05). The RR of moderate-to-severe pain was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.91) 12h postinstrumentation and the RR of pain incidence, regardless of its level, was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.92) 24h postinstrumentation. There was no significant difference in medication intake (sham or analgesic) between groups (p\u003E0.05). CONCLUSIONS Occlusal reduction was effective in reducing the intensity of postoperative pain 12h and 24h after root canal instrumentation in the first visit in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with sensitivity to percussion. Occlusal reduction lowered the risk of moderate-to-severe pain by about 40% 12h postinstrumentation and the overall risk of pain by 25% 24h postinstrumentation; yet, it did not affect medication intake.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Y E; Emara, R S; Sarhan, S M; El Boghdadi, R M; El-Bayoumi, M A A; El-Far, H M M; Sabet, N E; Abou El-Nasr, H M; Gawdat, S I; Amin, S A W","journal":"International endodontic journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/iej.13328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418236/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Friedman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h postinstrumentation","pain intensity","severe pain","postendodontic pain","preoperative pain","patients","intensity of postoperative pain","overall risk of pain","RR of pain incidence","medication intake","effect of occlusal reduction","CONCLUSIONS Occlusal reduction","RESULTS Occlusal reduction","root canal instrumentation","root canal filling","analgesic","intracanal medication","Friedman\u0027s test","risk of moderate","RR of moderate","root canal treatment of mandibular posterior teeth","symptomatic irreversible pulpitis","Wilcoxon\u0027s rank test","sensitivity","postobturation timepoints","percussion","sham capsule","equal groups","Relative Risk","visits","Mann-Whitney U-test","binary data","Chi2","controlled trial","\u03C72","NRS","numerical rating scale","significant difference","confidence interval","level","METHODOLOGY"],"language":"en"},

Ancient professors of Hygiene such as Celli, Pagliani, Sclavo, Petragnani, Seppilli and Giovanardi flanked politicians in other critical moments. They helped them to manage healthcare reforms, earthquakes response, Seveso Dioxin disaster, cholera and poliomielitis epidemics and other health threats. The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the paramount importance of the practical application of basic concepts of public health, which were considered so far became obsolete, such as personal hygiene, quarantine, individual protective devices or basic epidemiological measures. Hygiene and Public Health used to have a targeted audience in professionals and lecturers. Nowadays, these topics are critical and of concern of a much larger audience. Public Health women and men are now asked to act in task forces, media broadcasts, webinars and consulting activities. In phase 2 of this epidemic - which is about to begin when this volume is to be published - the role of Public Health professionals could become even more relevant. However, this unexpected season must be managed with seriousness and intelligence, capitalizing it also for the future.

Despite various attempts to improve the diagnosis and therapy of ovarian cancer patients, the survival rate for these patients is still dismal, mainly because most of them are diagnosed at a late stage. Up to 90% of ovarian cancers arise from neoplastic transformation of ovarian surface epithelial cells, and are usually referred to as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Unlike most human cancers, which are disseminated through blood-borne metastatic routes, EOC has traditionally been thought to be disseminated through direct migration of ovarian tumor cells to the peritoneal cavity and omentum via peritoneal fluid. It has recently been shown, however, that EOC can also be disseminated through blood-borne metastatic routes, challenging previous thoughts about ovarian cancer metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Here, we review our current understanding of the most updated cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EOC metastasis and discuss in more detail two main metastatic routes of EOC, i.e., transcoelomic metastasis and hematogenous metastasis. The emerging concept of blood-borne EOC metastasis has led to exploration of the significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as novel and non-invasive prognostic markers in this daunting cancer. We also evaluate the role of tumor stroma, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, dendritic cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components in EOC growth and metastasis. Lastly, we discuss therapeutic approaches for targeting EOC. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying EOC metastasis will open up avenues to the design of new therapeutic options. For instance, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the hematogenous metastasis of EOC, the biology of CTCs, and the detailed mechanisms through which EOC cells take advantage of stromal cells may help to find new opportunities for targeting EOC metastasis.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousefi, Meysam; Dehghani, Sadegh; Nosrati, Rahim; Ghanei, Mahmoud; Salmaninejad, Arash; Rajaie, Sara; Hasanzadeh, Malihe; Pasdar, Alireza","journal":"Cellular oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13402-020-00513-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EOC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EOC metastasis","EOC cells","ovarian cancer metastasis","hematogenous metastasis of EOC","EOC growth","epithelial ovarian cancer","BACKGROUND Ovarian cancer","transcoelomic metastasis","main metastatic routes of EOC","therapy of ovarian cancer patients","daunting cancer","ovarian cancers","dendritic cells","endothelial cells","direct migration of ovarian tumor cells","leading cause of cancer","lethal gynecologic cancer","significance of circulating tumor cells","neoplastic transformation of ovarian surface epithelial cells","advantage of stromal cells","molecular mechanisms","detailed mechanisms","tumor associated macrophages","role of tumor stroma","emerging concept of blood","peritoneal cavity","biology of CTCs","peritoneal fluid","new opportunities","design of new therapeutic options","therapeutic approaches","current understanding","human cancers","challenging previous thoughts","adipocytes","ECM","extracellular matrix","novel","TAMs","components","diagnosis","fibroblasts","non-invasive prognostic markers","survival rate","related mortality","omentum","CAFs","exploration","avenues","women","various attempts","instance","late stage","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

It is continually taking enormous toll on mankind by means of increasing number of deaths, associated co-morbidities and socio-economic loss around the globe. Unavailability of chemotherapeutics/vaccine has posed tremendous challenges to the scientists and doctors for developing urgent therapeutic strategy. In this connection, the present in silico study aims to understand the sequence divergence of spike protein (the major infective protein of SARS-CoV-2), its mode of interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) receptor of human and related animal hosts/reservoir. Moreover, involvement of the human Toll- like receptors (TLRs) against the spike protein has also been demonstrated. Our data indicated that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus and strongly binds with ACE2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin. We have also found that cell surface TLRs, especially TLR4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from SARS-CoV-2 to induce inflammatory responses. The present study supported the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 from bat and also revealed that TLR4 may have a crucial role in the virus-induced inflammatory consequences associated with COVID-19. Therefore, selective targeting of TLR4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive TLR4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat COVID-19. Finally, this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein, ACE2 or TLR-guided intervention strategy against COVID-19 shortly.

However, current approaches for identifying neutralizing Abs (nAbs) typically rely on dilution-based assays that are costly, inefficient, and only survey a small subset of the entire repertoire. There are also intrinsic biases in many steps of conventional nAb identification processes. More importantly, conventional assays rely on simple Ab-antigen binding assays, which may not result in identifying the most potent nAbs, as the strongest binder may not be the most potent nAb. Droplet microfluidic systems have the capability to overcome such limitations by conducting complex multi-step assays with high reliability, resolution, and throughput in a pico-liter volume water-in-oil emulsion droplet format. Here, we describe the development of PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated microfluidics ENabled Technology), a droplet microfluidic system that can enable high-throughput single-cell resolution identification of nAb repertoires elicited in response to viral infection. We demonstrate PRESCIENT\u0027s ability to identify Abs that neutralize a model viral agent, Murine coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus), which causes high mortality rates in experimentally infected mice. In-droplet infection of host cells by the virus was first demonstrated, followed by demonstration of in-droplet neutralization by nAbs produced from a single Ab-producing hybridoma cell. Finally, fluorescence intensity analyses of two populations of hybridoma cell lines (nAb-producing and non-nAb-producing hybridoma cell lines) successfully discriminated between the two populations. The presented strategy and platform have the potential to identify and investigate neutralizing activities against a broad range of potential infectious agents for which nAbs have yet to be discovered, significantly advancing the nAb identification process as well as reinvigorating the field of Ab discovery, characterization, and development.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wippold, Jose A; Wang, Han; Tingling, Joseph; Leibowitz, Julian L; de Figueiredo, Paul; Han, Arum","journal":"Lab on a chip","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c9lc01165j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional assays","droplet neutralization","populations of hybridoma cell lines","high-throughput single-cell resolution identification","Droplet microfluidic systems","single Ab","neutralizing Abs","droplet infection of host cells","high reliability","complex multi-step assays","simple Ab-antigen binding assays","dilution-based assays","broad range of potential infectious agents","Platform","viral infection","oil emulsion droplet format","identification processes","high mortality rates","murine hepatitis virus","field of Ab discovery","Murine coronavirus","steps of conventional","neutralizing activities","development of PRESCIENT","model viral agent","Technology","Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess","Integrated microfluidics","repertoires","pico-liter volume water","limitations","diagnostic tools","therapeutics","vaccines","infected mice","characterization","fluorescence intensity analyses","capability","response","small subset","entire repertoire","intrinsic biases","presented strategy","current approaches","strongest binder","PRESCIENT\u0027s ability","demonstration","antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Overall, individuals with underlying CVD who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience up to a ten-fold higher case-fatality rate compared to the general population. While the impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular health continues to evolve, few have defined this association from a frontline, public health perspective of populations disproportionately affected by CVD and COVID-19. Louisiana is ranked within the bottom five states for cardiovascular health, and is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally. Here, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city holding a sobering yet, resilient history with previous public health disasters. In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to healthcare, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities. Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razavi, Alexander C; Kelly, Tanika N; He, Jiang; Fernandez, Camilo; Whelton, Paul K; Krousel-Wood, Marie; Bazzano, Lydia A","journal":"Journal of the American Heart Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.016997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":["Louisiana","New Orleans"],"keyphrases":["cardiovascular health","CVD prevention efforts","underlying CVD","previous public health disasters","public health perspective of populations","future public health crises","highest COVID","current COVID","implications of COVID","Louisiana","potential pandemic-driven changes","case-fatality rates","setting of cardiovascular disease","treatment of communicable","higher case-fatality rate","non-communicable diseases","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","access","resilient history","healthcare","preventive pharmacotherapy","city","sobering","proposed recommendations","frontline","New Orleans","midst","management","lifestyle behaviors","general population","individuals","home","association","impact","racial disparities","parishes","process","paradigm","states","Medicine"],"language":"en"},

However, continuously high training loads with insufficient recovery may cause fatigue to accumulate and result in overtraining. A comprehensive systematic review is required to collate overtraining literature and improve the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying functional overreaching (FOR), non-functional overreaching (NFOR) and the overtraining syndrome (OTS) in resistance training. OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review was to establish markers of overtraining and elucidate the mechanisms underlying maladaptive resistance training conditions. Furthermore, this review aims to critically evaluate the methodological approaches of the overtraining literature. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus to identify studies up to June 2019. Electronic databases were searched using terms related to resistance training and overtraining. Records were included if they attempted to induce a state of overreaching or overtraining through resistance exercise in healthy participants. RESULTS A total of 22 studies were selected for review. Among these studies, eight resulted in decrements in performance and measured changes in performance during a follow-up period. There were four studies that reported decrease in performance yet failed to implement follow-up measures. A total of 10 studies reported no decline in performance. Overall, a lack of standardisation in methodology (follow-up performance testing) and diagnostic criteria prevents consistent determination of FOR, NFOR and OTS in resistance training. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have appropriately established FOR, NFOR or OTS in resistance training. Overtraining may be related to frequent high-intensity and monotonous resistance training. However, no marker other than a sustained decrease in performance has been established as a reliable indicator of overtraining in resistance exercise.

We found that PEDV infection had no effect on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein and mRNA levels, but that TLR4 regulated PEDV infection and the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we demonstrated that TLR4 regulated p38 phosphorylation but not extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (Erk1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) phosphorylation, and that GLY inhibited p38 phosphorylation but not Erk1/2 and JNK phosphorylation. Therefore, we further explored the relationship between high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and p38. We demonstrated that inhibition of HMGB1 using an antibody, mutation, or knockdown decreased p38 phosphorylation. Thus, HMGB1 participated in activation of p38 through TLR4.

Restoration of biomechanics such as leg length, femoral und acetabular offset is crucial in THA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative differences of these parameters after THA and to analyze their association to greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of trochanteric pain syndrome compared to patient reported outcome measures. 3D-CT scans of 90 patients were analyzed after minimalinvasive total hip arthroplasty and leg length, femoral and acetabular offset differences were measured. Clinical evaluation was performed three years after THA regarding the presence of trochanteric pain syndrome and using outcome measures. Furthermore, the patients\u0027 expectation were evaluated. Patients with trochanteric pain syndrome showed a higher absolute discrepancy of combined leg length, femoral and acetabular offset restoration compared to the non-operated contralateral side with 11.8 \u00B1 6.0 mm than patients without symptoms in the trochanteric region with 7.8 \u00B1 5.3 mm (p = 0.01).

Findings from a repeated cross sectional study using propensity score matching.","doi":"10.1186/s12913-019-4707-8","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"31752826","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND Vouchers are increasingly used as a demand-side subsidy to reduce financial hardship and improve quality of services. Elderly Healthcare Voucher Scheme has been introduced by the Hong Kong Government since 2009 to provide subsidy to elderly aged 65 and above to visit ten different types of private primary care providers for curative, preventive and chronic disease management. Several enhancements have been made over the past few years. This paper (as part of an evaluation study of this unique healthcare voucher scheme) aims to assess the long term impact of the voucher scheme in encouraging the use of primary care services. METHODS Two rounds of cross-sectional survey among elderly in Hong Kong were conducted in 2010 and 2016. Propensity score matching and analysis were used to compare changes in perception and usage of vouchers over time. RESULTS 61.5% of respondents in 2016 agreed \u0022the scheme encourages me to use more private primary care services\u0022, a significant increase from 36.2% in 2010. Among those who agreed in 2016, the majority thought the voucher scheme would encourage them to use acute services (90.3%) in the private sector, rather than preventive care (40.3%) and chronic disease management (12.2%). Respondents also reported that their current usual choice of care was visiting \u0022both public and private doctors\u0022 (61.9%), representing a significant increase (up from 48.4%) prior to their use of voucher. CONCLUSIONS The voucher scheme has encouraged the use of more private care services, particularly acute services rather than disease prevention or management of chronic disease. However, there needs to be caution that the untargeted and open-ended nature of voucher scheme could result in supply-induced demand which would affect long term financial sustainability. The dual utilization of health services in both the public and private sector may also compromise continuity and quality of care. The design of the voucher needs to be more specific, targeting prevention and chronic disease management rather than unspecified care which is mainly acute and episodic in order to maximize service delivery capacity as a whole for equitable access in universal health coverage and to contribute to a sustainable financing system.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yam, Carrie H K; Wong, Eliza L Y; Fung, Valerie L H; Griffiths, Sian M; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong","journal":"BMC health services research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4707-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare Voucher Scheme"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["private care services","use of voucher","private primary care services","use of primary care services","preventive care","quality of care","acute services","Elderly Healthcare Voucher Scheme","unspecified care","quality of services","unique healthcare voucher scheme","chronic disease management","management of chronic disease","open-ended nature of voucher scheme","private sector","disease prevention","private doctors","different types of private primary care providers","current usual choice of care","dual utilization of health services","subsidy","significant increase","respondents","long term financial sustainability","long term impact","Hong Kong Government","financial hardship","usage of vouchers","BACKGROUND Vouchers","universal health coverage","supply-induced demand","curative","equitable access","rounds of cross-sectional survey","order","evaluation study","service delivery capacity","changes","perception","continuity","analysis","METHODS","time","sustainable financing system","past","Propensity score","majority","CONCLUSIONS","enhancements","years","paper","RESULTS","design"],"language":"en"},

Methods The Dutch Radiological Society (NVvR) developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as Lung-RADS or BI-RADS. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 \u002B/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR). Eight observers assessed the scans using CO-RADS. Fleiss\u0027 kappa was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared to the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss\u0027 kappa was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.47), with the highest kappa for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI 0.54-0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was 9/161 (5.6%, 95% CI 1.0-10%), and the false positive rate for CO-RADS 5 was 1/286 (0.3%, 95% CI 0-1.0%). Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prokop, Mathias; van Everdingen, Wouter; van Rees Vellinga, Tjalco; Quarles van Ufford, Jet; St\u00F6ger, Lauran; Beenen, Ludo; Geurts, Bram; Gietema, Hester; Krdzalic, Jasenko; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia; van Ginneken, Bram; Brink, Monique","journal":"Radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020201473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Data System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CO-RADS categories","Conclusions CO-RADS","Lung-RADS","BI-RADS","clinical suspicion of COVID","clinical diagnosis of COVID","severe symptoms of COVID","standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID","positive RT-PCR","RT-PCR outcome","chest CTs of patients","non-enhanced chest CT","initial interobserver agreement","substantial interobserver agreement","false positive rate","absolute agreement","results","Data System","highest kappa","scores of individual observers","Fleiss","false negative rate","good performance","average AUC","categorical assessment scheme","NVvR","receiver","Dutch Radiological Society","hospital","Reporting","characteristics curve","Methods","median","efforts","standardization","resulting area","scans","confidence interval","scale","years","Purpose","observations"],"language":"en"},

However, risks and benefits of this adjunctive therapy remain uncertain. We aimed to evaluate periprocedural intravenous heparin use in Dutch stroke intervention centers and to assess its efficacy and safety. Methods- Patients registered between March 2014 and June 2016 in the MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke), including all patients treated with endovascular treatment in the Netherlands, were analyzed. The primary outcome was functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were successful recanalization (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction \u22652B), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality at 90 days. We used multilevel regression analysis to evaluate the association of periprocedural intravenous heparin on outcomes, adjusted for center effects and prognostic factors. To account for possible unobserved confounding by indication, we analyzed the effect of center preference to administer intravenous heparin, defined as percentage of patients treated with intravenous heparin in a center, on functional outcome. Results- One thousand four hundred eighty-eight patients from 16 centers were analyzed, of whom 398 (27%) received intravenous heparin (median dose 5000 international units). There was substantial between-center variability in the proportion of patients treated with intravenous heparin (range, 0%-94%). There was no significant difference in functional outcome between patients treated with intravenous heparin and those without (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.87-1.56), successful recanalization (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.89-1.71), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.65-1.99), or mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66-1.38). Analysis at center level showed that functional outcomes were better in centers with higher percentages of heparin administration (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.07 per 10% more heparin, 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). Conclusions- Substantial between-center variability exists in periprocedural intravenous heparin use during endovascular treatment, but the treatment is safe. Centers using heparin more often had better outcomes. A randomized trial is needed to further study these effects.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"van de Graaf, Rob A; Chalos, Vicky; van Es, Adriaan C G M; Emmer, Bart J; Lycklama \u00C0 Nijeholt, Geert J; van der Worp, H Bart; Schonewille, Wouter J; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik W J; Lingsma, Hester F; Roozenbeek, Bob","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.025329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31860411/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["periprocedural intravenous heparin use","association of periprocedural intravenous heparin","Purpose- Intravenous administration of heparin","adjusted odds ratio","functional outcomes","higher percentages of heparin administration","center variability","common odds ratio","center effects","center level","proportion of patients","percentage of patients","better outcomes","Methods- Patients","Secondary outcomes","effect of center preference","primary outcome","Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke","Dutch stroke intervention centers","successful recanalization","randomized trial","symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","mortality","days","Conclusions- Substantial","multilevel regression analysis","extended Thrombolysis","Cerebral Infarction","modified Rankin Scale","MR CLEAN Registry","median dose","international units","benefits","adjunctive therapy","indication","significant difference","possible unobserved confounding","risks","efficacy","prognostic factors","Background","range","Netherlands","safety","Results"],"language":"en"},

In our study, 62 faecal and intestinal samples from pigs with diarrhoea were collected in Guangxi Province, China, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve samples (19.4%, 12/62) were positive for PDCoV. Five complete genomes of PDCoV were then determined, and sequence alignment revealed that the five strains had discontinuous deletions at 400-401 aa in non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) and 758-760 aa in non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) compared with the respective proteins in the HKU15-44 strain. Notably, the CHN-GX81-2018 strain contained two insertions in the S gene and 3\u0027-UTR. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that four strains shared 98.2%-98.4% nucleotide identity with CHN-AH-2004 and were classified into a new cluster of China lineage strains, whereas the CHN-GX81-2018 strain shared 98.7% nucleotide identity with Vietnam/Binh21/2015 and belonged to the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage. Recombination analyses revealed that four strains were the result of recombination between CHN-HB-2014 and Vietnam/Binh21/2015 strains.

There are several types of bioprinters, especially inkjet-based bioprinter, which can be used not only as a printer for arranging cells but also as a precision cell-dispensing device with controlled cell numbers similar to a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Precise cell dispensers are expected to be useful in the fields of drug discovery and single-cell analysis. However, there are enduring concerns about the impacts of cell dispensers on cell integrity, particularly on sensitive cells, such as stem cells. In response to the concerns stated above, we developed a stress-free and media-direct-dispensing inkjet bioprinter. In the present study, in addition to conventional viability assessments, we evaluated the gene expression using RNA-seq to investigate whether the developed bioprinter influenced cell integrity in mouse embryonic stem cells. We evaluated the developed bioprinter based on three dispensing methods: manual operation using a micropipette, FACS and the developed inkjet bioprinter. According to the results, the developed inkjet bioprinter exhibited cell-friendly dispensing performance, which was similar to the manual dispensing operation, based not only on cell viability but also on gene expression levels.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yumoto, Masayuki; Hemmi, Natsuko; Sato, Naoki; Kawashima, Yudai; Arikawa, Koji; Ide, Keigo; Hosokawa, Masahito; Seo, Manabu; Takeyama, Haruko","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64193-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell integrity","cell viability","cell sorter","developed bioprinter","dispensing inkjet bioprinter","developed inkjet bioprinter","impacts of cell dispensers","Precise cell dispensers","precision cell-dispensing device","cell-friendly dispensing performance","inkjet-based bioprinter","single-cell analysis","controlled cell numbers similar","dispensing methods","manual dispensing operation","sensitive cells","fields of drug discovery","mouse embryonic stem cells","FACS","manual operation","gene expression levels","enduring concerns","conventional viability assessments","fields of regenerative medicine","fluorescence","micropipette","addition","media-direct","RNA-seq","present study","types of bioprinters","results","Bioprinting technology","response"],"language":"en"},

In the context of academic meetings and conferences, there is the growing need for a set of guidelines secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the growing environmental and economic challenges that large academic and medical conferences face. These Virtual Meetings Best Practices were established in response to the scant evidence and guidance on the topic. METHODS These best practice guidelines were developed from a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and lay literature. MEDLINE and Embase databases were scoped for relevant, non-duplicate articles. For lay articles, Google searches were utilized. The recommendations that comprise this document are a compilation of nonexperimental descriptive studies (e.g. case studies) and expert committee reports, opinions and/or experience of respected authorities, and lay articles. RESULTS We identified four phases of the meeting cycle: Pre-planning considerations, Planning, Accomplishing conference goals through execution, gauging Response and Engaging the target audience for future cycles (PrePARE). Akin to the Plan, Do, Study, Act Cycle of quality improvement interventions, this document is meant to drive meaningful initial and subsequent interventions in the meetings of the medical and academic community. This covers actions and preparation for registration, scheduling, speakers, attendees, event type, technology, monetization/marketing, dealing with disruptions, post-event deliverables, response and engagement strategies. Enhanced access to integrated, high-quality and efficient virtual meetings will establish a new norm as an effective alternative for innovative health research, education and information dissemination in orthopaedics and beyond. CONCLUSIONS Given the uncertainty of whether large in-person gatherings will be permitted, advisable or responsible later into the summer of 2020 and beyond, these guidelines will aid events being converted and scheduled as virtual-only meetings. As we move forward in the era of increased utility and utilization of virtual conferencing, these guidelines will serve as a benchmark and standard for surgeons in the field.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubinger, Luc; Gazendam, Aaron; Ekhtiari, Seper; Nucci, Nicholas; Payne, Abbey; Johal, Herman; Khanduja, Vikas; Bhandari, Mohit","journal":"International orthopaedics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04615-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient virtual meetings","response","lay literature","context of academic meetings","Virtual Meetings Best Practices","lay articles","medical community","academic community","best practice guidelines","reviewed literature","grey literature","document","utilization of virtual conferencing","medical conferences face","set of guidelines secondary","pandemic","non-duplicate articles","case studies","event type","meeting cycle","subsequent interventions","growing need","current COVID","Act Cycle of quality improvement interventions","Pre-planning considerations","post-event deliverables","compilation of nonexperimental descriptive studies","education","innovative health research","effective alternative","economic challenges","scheduling","speakers","attendees","disruptions","new norm","scoping review of peer","information dissemination","conference goals","expert committee reports","registration","opinions","marketing","technology","Study","monetization","experience of respected authorities","engagement strategies","era of increased utility","preparation","target audience","scant evidence","guidance","communication","execution","Embase databases","Enhanced access","person gatherings","standard","surgeons","future cycles","topic","actions","orthopaedics","uncertainty","phases","benchmark","METHODS","Google searches","summer","field","MEDLINE","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","events","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

In aesthetic clinics, most procedures are provided on one to one basis by the physician or therapist. In such a scenario, guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are of particular importance. METHODS An online meeting of an international group of experts in the field of aesthetic medicine, with experience in administration of an aesthetic clinic, was convened. The meeting aimed to provide a set of consensus guidelines to protect clinic staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS Consensus guidelines for \u0027preferred practices\u0027 were provided for scheduling of patients, patient evaluation and triaging, and for safety precautions about the different procedures. Procedures were categorized into low-risk, moderate risk, and high-risk based on the likelihood of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the patient to the treating physician or therapist. CONCLUSIONS While not intended to be complete or exhaustive, these guidelines provide sound infection control measures for aesthetic practices. Since guidelines regarding safety measures and use of PPEs may vary from country to country, the local guidelines should also be followed to prevent COVID-19 infection in aesthetic clinics.

We established that the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in neonatal mice. Similarly, human cord blood-derived macrophages express IL-27 genes and secrete more cytokine than macrophages from adults. In the present work, we hypothesized that increased levels of IL-27 predispose neonatal mice to more severe infection during Gram-negative sepsis. Serum IL-27 levels continued to rise during infection. Peripheral tissue analysis revealed systemic IL-27 expression, while myeloid cell profiling identified Gr-1 and F4/80-expressing cells as the most abundant producers of IL-27 during infection. Increased IL-27 levels were consistent with increased mortality that was improved in IL-27-receptor \u03B1 (R\u03B1)-/- mice that lack a functional IL-27 receptor. Infected IL-27R\u03B1-/- pups also exhibited improved weight gain and reduced morbidity. This was consistent with reduced bacterial burdens and more efficient bacterial killing by Ly6B.2\u002B myeloid cells and macrophages compared to WT neonates. Live animal imaging further supported a more severe and disseminated infection in WT neonates. This is the first report to describe the impact of elevated early life IL-27 on the host response in a neonatal infection model while also defining the cell and tissue sources of cytokine. IL-27 is frequently associated with suppressed inflammation. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-27 indirectly promotes an inflammatory cytokine response during neonatal sepsis by directly compromising control of bacteria that drive the inflammatory response. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-27 represents a therapeutic target to limit susceptibility and improve infectious outcomes in neonatal sepsis.","publish_time":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seman, Brittany G; Vance, Jordan K; Rawson, Travis W; Witt, Michelle R; Huckaby, Annalisa B; Povroznik, Jessica M; Bradford, Shelby D; Barbier, Mariette; Robinson, Cory M","journal":"Infection and immunity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00828-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Increased IL","systemic IL","functional IL","Infected IL","Serum IL","increased levels of IL","abundant producers of IL","neonatal sepsis","neonatal mice","impact of elevated early life IL","neonatal infection model","bacterial sepsis","severe infection","human cord blood-derived macrophages express IL","inflammatory cytokine response","Gram-negative sepsis","increased risk","increased mortality","inflammatory response","WT neonates","tissue sources of cytokine","reduced bacterial burdens","myeloid cells","host response","R\u03B1","immune suppressive cytokine interleukin","efficient bacterial killing","myeloid cell profiling","reduced morbidity","receptor \u03B1","Peripheral tissue analysis","improved weight gain","expression","genes","susceptibility","Ly6B","infectious outcomes","pups","control of bacteria","therapeutic target","F4","Live animal imaging","present work","report","contrast","findings","adults","suppressed inflammation","results"],"language":"en"},

In 2014, approximately 6,000,000 people in the United States could benefit from PC, and this number is expected to increase over the next 25 years. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this review is to shed light on the significance of PC and provide a holistic view outlining both the benefits and existing barriers. METHODS A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify articles published in journals from 1948 to 2019. A narrative approach was used to search the grey literature. DISCUSSION Traditionally, the philosophy behind PC was based on alleviating suffering associated with terminal illnesses; PC was recommended only after other treatment options had been exhausted. However, the tenets of PC are applicable to anyone with a life-threatening illness as it is beneficial in conjunction with traditional treatments. It is now recognized that PC services are valuable when initiated alongside disease-modifying therapy early in the disease course. Studies have shown that PC decreased total symptom burden, reduced hospitalizations, and enabled patients to remain safely at home. CONCLUSION As the population ages and chronic illnesses become more widespread, there continues to be a growing need for PC programs. The importance of PC should not be overlooked despite existing barriers such as the lack of professional training and the cost of implementation. Education and open discussion play essential roles in the successful early integration of PC.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Senderovich, Helen; McFadyen, Kristen","journal":"Rambam Maimonides medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5041/rmmj.10394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["PC programs","significance of PC","PC services","tenets of PC","importance of PC","successful early integration of PC","existing barriers","literature search","chronic illnesses","enabled patients","terminal illnesses","open discussion","disease course","grey literature","essential roles","reduced hospitalizations","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","total symptom burden","holistic view outlining","Web of Science","PubMed","MEDLINE","benefits","alleviating suffering","lack of professional training","population ages","palliative care","conjunction","families","Education","life-threatening illness","cost of implementation","review","traditional treatments","articles","CONCLUSION","therapy","United States","light","growing need","team","philosophy","OBJECTIVES","purpose","people","journals","INTRODUCTION","home","METHODS","Studies","narrative approach","treatment options","number","years"],"language":"en"},

Purpose To investigate CT features of patients with COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, and to compare the accuracy of CT with RT-PCR. Methods In this prospective study from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were: chest CT with contrast medium performed for vascular indications, patients who refused chest CT or hospitalization, and severe CT motion artifact. All patients underwent RT-PCR and chest CT. Diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using RT-PCR as reference. Chest CT features were calculated in a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients. CT features of hospitalized patients and patient in home isolation were compared by using Pearson chi squared test. Results Our study population comprised 158 consecutive study participants (83 male and 75 female, mean age 57 y \u00B117). Fever was observed in 97/158 (61%), cough in 88/158 (56%), dyspnea in 52/158 (33%), lymphocytopenia in 95/158 (60%), increased C-reactive protein level in 139/158 (88%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase in 128/158 (81%) study participants. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT were 97% (60/62)[95% IC, 88-99%], 56% (54/96)[95% IC,45-66%] and 72% (114/158)[95% IC 64-78%], respectively. In the subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients, ground-glass opacities (GGO) were present in 58/58 (100%), multilobe and posterior involvement were both present in 54/58 (93%), bilateral pneumonia in 53/58 (91%), and subsegmental vessel enlargement (\u003E 3 mm) in 52/58 (89%) of study participants. Conclusion The typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Rome, Italy, was peripherally ground-glass opacities with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (\u003E 3 mm).

Patients with IBD are at increased risk of infection, especially when they have active disease and are taking immunosuppressive therapy. The characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD remain unclear. DESIGN This Italian prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with an established IBD diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19. Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death). RESULTS Between 11 and 29 March 2020, 79 patients with IBD with COVID-19 were enrolled at 24 IBD referral units. Thirty-six patients had COVID-19-related pneumonia (46%), 22 (28%) were hospitalised, 7 (9%) required non-mechanical ventilation, 9 (11%) required continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 2 (3%) had endotracheal intubation and 6 (8%) died. Four patients (6%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 while they were being hospitalised for a severe flare of IBD. Age over 65 years (p=0.03), UC diagnosis (p=0.03), IBD activity (p=0.003) and a CCI score \u003E1 (p=0.04) were significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas concomitant IBD treatments were not. Age over 65 years (p=0.002), active IBD (p=0.02) and higher CCI score were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSIONS Active IBD, old age and comorbidities were associated with a negative COVID-19 outcome, whereas IBD treatments were not. Preventing acute IBD flares may avoid fatal COVID-19 in patients with IBD.

Patients\u0027 perceptions of stress and their use of coping strategies may influence fatigue severity. This study extends our previous work describing distinct profiles of morning (i.e., Very Low, Low, High, and Very High) and evening (i.e., Low, Moderate, High, and Very High) fatigue in oncology patients by evaluating for differences in stress and coping strategies among these fatigue classes. METHODS This longitudinal study evaluated for changes in morning and evening fatigue in oncology patients (n = 1332) over two cycles of chemotherapy (CTX). Patients completed measures of cumulative exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) (i.e., the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised), general stress (i.e., Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]), cancer-specific stress (i.e., Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]), and coping strategies (i.e., Brief Cope). Differences among the latent classes were evaluated using analyses of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, or chi-square tests. RESULTS Patients in both the Very High morning and evening fatigue classes reported higher numbers of and a higher impact from previous SLEs and higher PSS scores than the other fatigue classes. The IES-R scores for the Very High morning fatigue class met the criterion for subsyndromal PTSD. Patients in the Very High evening fatigue class used a higher number of engagement coping strategies compared with the Very High morning fatigue class. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that interventions to reduce stress and enhance coping warrant investigation to decrease fatigue in patients undergoing CTX.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wright, Fay; Kober, Kord M; Cooper, Bruce A; Paul, Steven M; Conley, Yvette P; Hammer, Marilyn; Levine, Jon D; Miaskowski, Christine","journal":"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05303-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31956947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Life Stressor Checklist-Revised","PSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["High morning fatigue class","High evening fatigue class","evening fatigue classes","fatigue severity","oncology patients","RESULTS Patients","general stress","use of coping strategies","higher impact","Perceived Stress Scale","cancer-specific stress","higher PSS scores","Patients\u0027 perceptions of stress","higher numbers","latent classes","distinct profiles of morning","coping warrant investigation","higher number of engagement","previous SLEs","IES-R scores","differences","CTX","stressful life events","Impact of Event Scale","stressful experiences","previous work","cancer diagnosis","longitudinal study","Life Stressor Checklist","associated treatments","measures of cumulative exposure","changes","criterion","Kruskal-Wallis","analyses of variance","PURPOSE","interventions","subsyndromal PTSD","chi-square tests","METHODS","findings","Brief Cope","cycles of chemotherapy","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A retrospective case analysis of effectiveness and safety of aliskiren treatment to lower blood pressure in three severe and one critically ill patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. Results: Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory symptoms. Three cases were confirmed by 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and antibody detection (severe type), and one with cardiac insufficiency was clinically determined (critically ill type). The previous diagnosis of hypertension was clear. Two patients took calcium channel antagonist (CCB), one patient took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and one patient took angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). After admission, ACEI or ARB were discontinued, one patient with heart failure patient was treated by aliskiren combined with diuretic; 3 patients were treated with aliskiren combined with CCB. Two patients were stopped to use CCB due to low blood pressure after 1 to 2 weeks of using CCB and aliskiren.

As in humans, clinical outcome in dogs is variable, ranging from acute death to asymptomatic infections or chronic heart disease. In order to characterize cardiac manifestations of T. cruzi infections, we tracked a cohort of naturally-infected dogs and a matched cohort of uninfected dogs. We hypothesized that selected measures of cardiac disease (abnormal rate, abnormal rhythm, and elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI; a biomarker of cardiac injury)) would occur more commonly in infected than uninfected dogs matched by age, breed, sex and location. In addition to the clearly positive and negative dogs, we specifically tracked dogs with discordant test results across three independent serological assays to gather clinical data that might elucidate the infection status of these animals and inform the utility of the different testing approaches. RESULTS We placed an ambulatory ECG monitor (Holter) on 48 government working dogs and analyzed 39 successful recordings that met length and quality criteria from 17 T. cruzi-infected, 18 uninfected dogs and 4 dogs with discordant results. Overall, 76.5% of positive, 100.0% of discordant, and 11.1% of negative dogs showed \u003E 1 ECG abnormality (p \u003C 0.0001), and positive and discordant dogs had a higher mean number of different types of ECG abnormalities than negative dogs (p \u003C 0.001-0.014). The most common cardiac abnormalities included supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and atrioventricular block. Positive dogs had higher serum concentrations of cTnI than both negative dogs (p = 0.044) and discordant dogs (p = 0.06). Based on dog handler reports, nearly all (4/5; 80%) dogs with reported performance decline or fatigue were T. cruzi-infected dogs. CONCLUSIONS Further understanding cardiac manifestations in dogs naturally infected with T. cruzi is critical for prognostication, establishing a baseline for drug and vaccine studies, and better understanding of zoonotic risk.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyers, Alyssa C; Ellis, Megan M; Purnell, Julia C; Auckland, Lisa D; Meinders, Marvin; Saunders, Ashley B; Hamer, Sarah A","journal":"BMC veterinary research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02322-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["discordant dogs","negative dogs","Positive dogs","domestic dogs","cruzi-infected dogs","matched cohort of uninfected dogs","cardiac manifestations","discordant results","cruzi infections","Trypanosoma cruzi","common cardiac abnormalities","discordant test results","selected measures of cardiac disease","elevated cardiac troponin","biomarker of cardiac injury","ECG abnormality","humans","higher mean number of different types of ECG abnormalities","chronic heart disease","ambulatory ECG monitor","BACKGROUND Chagas disease","abnormal rate","abnormal rhythm","higher serum concentrations of cTnI","asymptomatic infections","clinical data","clinical outcome","different testing approaches","better understanding of zoonotic risk","wildlife","fatigue","independent serological assays","ventricular arrhythmias","acute death","age","occasional vector spillover","vaccine studies","baseline","drug","triatomine vectors","successful recordings","quality criteria","Holter","breed","reported performance decline","length","atrioventricular block","utility","prognostication","government","infection status","animals","sex","location","CONCLUSIONS","order","addition","dog handler"],"language":"en"},

We collected 27 melanotic Xp11 neoplasms, the largest series to date, for a comprehensive evaluation. Fourteen of the cases, along with 8 alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPS), 9 conventional PEComas, and a control group of 7 normal tissues were submitted to RNA sequencing. Follow-up available in 22 patients showed 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 47.6 and 35.7% respectively, which were similar to ASPS and significantly worse than conventional PEComa. Univariate analysis of location (occurring in the kidney versus not kidney), infiltrative growth pattern, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity \u22652/50 HPF, necrosis, and lymphovascular invasion were found to be associated with OS and/or DFS. Multivariate analysis identified that location was the only factor found to independently correlate with DFS. More importantly, RNA sequencing-based clustering analysis segregated melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS, clearly from other tumors including conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and formed a compact cluster representative of the largely similar expression signature. In this study, we first clearly define the true biologic nature that melanotic Xp11 neoplasms are distinctive malignant mesenchymal tumors, rather than simply PEComa variants with occasionally unpredictable behavior. Meanwhile, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS more likely represent phenotypic variants of the same entity, which is distinct from conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation RCC. Based on these important findings, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm might be reclassified into a distinctive entity together with ASPS, independent from PEComa, in the future revisions of the current World Health Organization categories of tumors of soft tissue and bone for the improved reclassification.

METHOD Data from Optum Clinformatics\u00AE Data Mart (2013-2016) were used for this retrospective cohort study. Diagnostic codes were used to identify adults (\u226518y) with CP, incident cases of MAD, and covariates (other neurodevelopmental conditions, sleep disorders, arthritis). Pain (any type, location) was identified between 1st October 2014 and 30th September 2015. The pain group was divided into new or consistent pain if they had a history of pain (i.e. consistent) in the 12 months before their first pain claim date. Crude incidence rates of MAD (expressed per 100 person-years) were estimated. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of MAD after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS Adults that had new pain (n=859; incidence rate=15.5) or consistent pain (n=1303; incidence rate=17.9) had greater crude incidence rate of MAD compared to adults without pain (n=3726; incidence rate=5.9). The elevated rate of MAD remained after adjusting for covariates, for new pain (hazard ratio=2.4; 95% CI=1.9-3.0) and consistent pain (hazard ratio=2.1; 95% CI=1.7-2.7). INTERPRETATION Pain is associated with greater incidence of MAD in adults with CP. This association remained after accounting for potential confounding factors. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS What this paper adds Pain was associated with higher 12-month incidence of mood affective disorders (MAD). The 12-month MAD incidence was similar between new and consistent pain groups. The MAD incidence remained higher adjusting for neurodevelopmental comorbidities, sleep disorders, and arthritis.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whitney, Daniel G; Bell, Sarah; Whibley, Daniel; Van der Slot, Wilma M A; Hurvitz, Edward A; Haapala, Heidi J; Peterson, Mark D; Warschausky, Seth A","journal":"Developmental medicine and child neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.14559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388867/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Optum Clinformatics\u00AE Data Mart"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new pain","month MAD incidence","history of pain","INTERPRETATION Pain","greater incidence of MAD","consistent pain groups","greater crude incidence rate of MAD","Crude incidence rates of MAD","elevated rate of MAD","pain claim date","month incidence of mood affective disorders","incident cases of MAD","sleep disorders","RESULTS Adults","hazard ratio","covariates","higher adjusting","CP","arthritis","PAPER","neurodevelopmental comorbidities","neurodevelopmental conditions","METHOD Data","Data Mart","Optum Clinformatics","association","confidence interval","accounting","months","cerebral palsy","potential confounding factors","Cox regression","retrospective cohort study","Diagnostic codes","type","location","person-years"],"language":"en"},

The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of rectal ESD in North America. Methods This is a multicenter retrospective analysis of rectal ESD between January 2010 and September 2018 in 15 centers. End points included: rates of en bloc resection, R0 resection, adverse events, comparison of pre- and post-ESD histology, and factors associated with failed resection. Results In total, 171 patients (median age 63 years; 56 % men) underwent rectal ESD (median size 43 mm). En bloc resection was achieved in 141 cases (82.5 %; 95 %CI 76.8-88.2), including 24 of 27 (88.9 %) with prior failed endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). R0 resection rate was 74.9 % (95 %CI 68.4-81.4). Post-ESD bleeding and perforation occurred in 4 (2.3 %) and 7 (4.1 %), respectively. Covert submucosal invasive cancer (SMIC) was identified in 8.6 % of post-ESD specimens. There was one case (1/120; 0.8 %) of recurrence at a median follow-up of 31 weeks; IQR: 19-76 weeks). Older age and higher body mass index (BMI) were predictors of failed R0 resection, whereas submucosal fibrosis was associated with a higher likelihood of both failed en bloc and R0 resection. Conclusion Rectal ESD in North America is safe and is associated with high en bloc and R0 resection rates. The presence of submucosal fibrosis was the main predictor of failed en bloc and R0 resection. ESD can be considered for select rectal lesions, and serves not only to establish a definitive tissue diagnosis but also to provide curative resection for lesions with covert advanced disease.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Dennis; Aihara, Hiroyuki; Perbtani, Yaseen B; Wang, Andrew Y; Aadam, Abdul Aziz; Tomizawa, Yutaka; Hwang, Joo Ha; Zou, Baiming; Natov, Nikola S; Siegel, Amanda; Khoshknab, Milad Pourmousavi; Khashab, Mouen A; Ngamruengphong, Saowanee; Khara, Harshit S; Diehl, David L; Maniere, Thibaut; Andrawes, Sherif; Benias, Petros; Kumta, Nikhil A; Ramay, Fariha; Kim, Raymond E; Samarasena, Jason; Chang, Kenneth; Hashimoto, Rintaro; Tharian, Benjamin; Inamdar, Sumant; Lan, Gloria; Sethi, Amrita; Nosler, Michael J; Tabash, Abdalaziz; Othman, Mohamed O; Draganov, Peter V","journal":"Endoscopy international open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1010-5663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Covert"],"organizations":["ESD","Conclusion Rectal ESD"],"locations":["West","North America"],"keyphrases":["failed resection","R0 resection rates","curative resection","rates of en bloc resection","predictors of failed R0 resection","efficacy of rectal ESD","Conclusion Rectal ESD","Rectal lesions","post-ESD histology","Post-ESD bleeding","post-ESD specimens","prior failed endoscopic mucosal resection","high en bloc","multicenter retrospective analysis of rectal ESD","main predictor of failed en bloc","median age","endoscopic submucosal dissection","presence of submucosal fibrosis","Covert submucosal invasive cancer","North America","median follow-up","median size","weeks","higher likelihood","Older age","covert advanced disease","higher body mass index","BMI","comparison of pre-","adverse events","patients","training","EMR","factors","total","years","SMIC","IQR","End points","Methods","definitive tissue diagnosis","perforation","safety","Results","recurrence","West","Background","cases","centers"],"language":"en"},

All U.S. states have advised their cystic fibrosis (CF) populations to socially isolate. Major health care payors such as Medicare and most private insurance companies have agreed to reimburse health care providers for telemedicine and telephone visits. Methods: The CF adult team at the University of Virginia (UVA) transitioned from face-to-face clinics to multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics by using WebEx\u00AE (Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA), a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant platform. Interventions: Patients were contacted before scheduled visits and triaged into: (1) patients eligible for the multidisciplinary telemedicine clinic, (2) patients to be seen in clinic urgently due to acute needs, and (3) stable patients who can be rescheduled at a later time. Ineligible patients for the telemedicine clinic due to lack of access to technology were followed up via telephone. Results: A total of 63 patients were scheduled to be seen in the UVA clinic over 4 weeks, 10 clinic days. Of these patients, 20 (32%) rescheduled their appointment. In addition, 2 patients (3%) were seen in clinic for acute needs and 38 (60%) were seen by the multidisciplinary team through telemedicine. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a telemedicine clinic process that serves the needs of a multidisciplinary care team is paramount to preserving the CF care model. Through a systematic design and test process, a feasible and sustainable program was created that can be utilized by other multidisciplinary programs to adapt to their context.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Compton, Martina; Soper, Morgan; Reilly, Bonnie; Gettle, Lucy; List, Rhonda; Bailey, Molly; Bruschwein, Heather; Somerville, Lindsay; Albon, Dana","journal":"Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medicare","UVA","University of Virginia","Cisco Systems","Health Insurance Portability","CF"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["telemedicine clinic process","UVA clinic","patients eligible","Ineligible patients","stable patients","multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics","multidisciplinary care team","multidisciplinary team","clinic days","health care providers","multidisciplinary programs","Major health care payors","CF care model","acute needs","Health Insurance Portability","CF adult team","major world health problem","pandemic","telephone visits","COVID","context","face-to-face clinics","test process","private insurance companies","Medicare","WebEx","Cisco Systems","Accountability Act","San Jose","University of Virginia","HIPAA","cystic fibrosis","lack of access","weeks","systematic design","sustainable program","technology","populations","Methods","compliant platform","states","Introduction","coronavirus","Results","total","later time","Conclusions","Interventions","addition","appointment"],"language":"en"},

Monitoring temperature currently requires invasive probes. This work investigates a novel foam-based flexible sensor worn behind the ear for the measurement of core body temperature. This observational study uses the device prototype and clinical data to compare three methods for calculating the temperature from this sensor: a basic heat-flow model, a new dynamic model that addresses changing surrounding temperatures and one that combines the dynamic model with a correction for adhesive quality. Clinical validation was performed with 21 surgical patients (average length of surgery 4.4 h) using an esophageal temperature probe as reference. The operative period was divided into four segments: normal periods (with stable surrounding temperatures), surrounding temperatures increasing due to the use of the Bair Hugger\u2122, stable periods during Bair Hugger\u2122 use and surrounding temperatures decreasing due to its removal. The error bias and limits of agreement over these segments were on average of - 0.05 \u00B1 0.28 \u00B0C (95% limits of agreement) overall. The dynamic model outperformed the simple heat-flow model for periods of surrounding temperature changes (12.7% of total time) while it had a similar, high, performance for the temperature-stable periods. The results suggest that our proposed topical sensor can replace invasive core temp sensors and provide a means of consistently measuring core body temperature despite surrounding temperature shifts.","publish_time":"2020-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atallah, Louis; Ciuhu, Calina; Paulussen, Igor; Bongers, Edwin; Blom, Antoon H M; Idrissi, Akram; Noordergraaf, Gerrit","journal":"Journal of clinical monitoring and computing","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-019-00446-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31902094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["temperature-stable periods","surrounding temperature shifts","periods of surrounding temperature changes","Monitoring temperature","measurement of core body temperature","stable surrounding temperatures","esophageal temperature probe","new dynamic model","simple heat-flow model","basic heat-flow model","normal periods","invasive core temp sensors","flexible sensor","Bair Hugger","segments","limits of agreement","use","proposed topical sensor","surgical patients","invasive probes","clinical data","Clinical validation","average length of surgery","active warming of patients","means","device prototype","ear","performance","novel foam","correction","observational study","adhesive quality","total time","results","error bias","reference","normothermia","methods","work","operative period","removal","Clinicians"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQoL of IBD patients. We aimed to evaluate HRQoL in IBD patient\u0027s pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic using the IBD-disk questionnaire and explore associations between socio demographic factors, disease types, severity and impaired HRQoL in patients with IBD. Patients and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Saudi Arabia between November 2019 and March 2020 at the outpatient IBD clinics. The HRQoL of patients was assessed using the 10-item IBD-disk questionnaire. Results A total of 59 IBD patients (40 Crohn\u0027s disease, 19 Ulcerative colitis) with a mean disease duration of 3.5 years were included. Most of the patients (77.97%) were on biologics while 35.59% were on immune modulators, 16.94% on 5-ASA, and 3.38% were on corticosteroids. There was no difference between any of the 10 IBD-disk variables pre and post-COVID-19 pandemic apart from the perception of body image, where there was a slightly more negative perception with an increase from 2.53 to 3.39 (P = 0.05) There was no significant difference in HRQoL between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u0027s disease in any of domains. Conclusion The current study showed that disability and HRQoL appears to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic among our cohort, however further studies with longer follow up and larger sample size is needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azzam, Nahla A; Aljebreen, Abdulrahman; Almuhareb, Arwa; Almadi, Majid A","journal":"Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/sjg.sjg_175_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415045/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["HRQoL of IBD patients","HRQoL of patients","pandemic","impaired HRQoL","item IBD-disk questionnaire","IBD patient\u0027s pre-","outpatient IBD clinics","Crohn\u0027s disease","IBD-disk variables pre","disease types","post-COVID","mean disease duration","Inflammatory bowel disease","Ulcerative colitis","disability","cross-sectional study","current study","significant difference","negative perception","perception of body image","severity","associations","socio demographic factors","patients\u0027 health-related quality of life","chronic disorder","tertiary care centre","Saudi Arabia","increase","Conclusion","Background","years","Methods","cohort","larger sample size","studies","domains","impact","total","immune modulators","biologics","ASA","corticosteroids"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI. Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution. RESULTS The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of \u03B2 Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days). No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV. The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus. This finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yezhen; Zhang, Shihao; Chen, Jiayi; Wan, Chengsong; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Bao","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV","bat-SL","mutations of SARS","variation of SARS","positive time evolution signal","weak time evolution signal","bat coronavirus BetaCoV","genomic evolution tree","genomic sequences of SARS","bat-associated coronavirus","full-length genome sequence of SARS","average tMRCA time","strong positive temporal evolution relationship","CoVZC45","Yunnan","ongoing epidemic","RaTG13","selection pressure","days","pressure of purification selection","phylogenetic tree","Sarbecovirus subgenus of \u03B2 Coronavirus genus","MEGA-X","TempEst","CoVZXC21","bioinformatics","BEAST","major cause","software","METHODS","evidence","sources","databases of GISAID","NCBI","OBJECTIVE","finding","end"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was performed on children diagnosed with leukodystrophies in Peking University First Hospital from January 2004 to June 2019, and the patients were followed for 5.5 years (0.4-14.2 years) after the first visit. RESULTS A total of 333 patients were included. The overall incidence of epilepsy was 30.6% (102/333). Alexander disease had the highest incidence (77.3%, 51/66), followed by vanishing white matter disease (41.2%, 21/51), Canavan disease (33.3%, 1/3), megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (32.1%, 9/28), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (23.1%, 3/13), Krabbe disease (18.8%, 3/16), metachromatic leukodystrophy (14.3%, 6/42), and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (7.0%, 8/114). The incidence of epilepsy in leukodystrophies classified as astrocytopathies was higher than that in myelin disorders (55.9% vs. 11.2%, P \u003C 0.001). Of the 102 patients with epilepsy, seizures were the chief complaint in 61.8% (63/102) and the initial symptom in 22.5% (23/102). The median age at seizure onset was 20.5 months (1 day-176 months). A total of 63.7% (65/102) of children were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the responder rate was 90.8% (59/65) at the last follow-up, including 71.2% (42/59) of children who were seizure free. CONCLUSIONS Epilepsy was not uncommon in children with leukodystrophies. Children with Alexander disease had the highest incidence; whereas, children with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease had the lowest incidence. Children with leukodystrophies classified as astrocytopathies were more prone to have epilepsy than those classified as myelin disorders. Most children with leukodystrophies who presented with epilepsy showed a good response to antiepileptic drugs.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jie; Ban, Tingting; Zhou, Ling; Ji, Haoran; Yan, Huifang; Shi, Zhen; Cao, Binbin; Jiang, Yuwu; Wang, Jingmin; Wu, Ye","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09889-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388833/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alexander"],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Epilepsy","Peking University First Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","overall incidence of epilepsy","CONCLUSIONS Epilepsy","BACKGROUND Epilepsy","Alexander disease","highest incidence","Canavan disease","Krabbe disease","Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease","lowest incidence","different types of leukodystrophies","white matter disease","patients","astrocytopathies","months","antiepileptic drugs","myelin disorders","years","total","seizure onset","seizure free","retrospective observational cohort study","METHODS","AEDs","seizures","good response","Peking University","median age","megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy","subcortical cysts","day","Hospital","chief complaint","manifestations","X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy","responder rate","metachromatic leukodystrophy","initial symptom","visit","follow-up"],"language":"en"},

METHODS In this prospective, observational, and comparative study, 40 acromegaly patients and 40 healthy control participants were included. Serum IGF-1 levels and disease duration of all patients were noted. Macular layers and angiography scanning was performed with a Zeiss Cirrus 5000 OCTA system. Macular thickness, RNFL, and GC-IPL values were obtained. For central vessel and perfusion density, central 6 mm was obtained and was evaluated by dividing into three groups (inner, outer, full). FAZ parameters were evaluated dividing into three groups (area, perimeter, circularity index). Analysis of the data was performed with the SPSS for Windows. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the patient group and the control group in terms of age, gender, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), intraocular pressure (IOP), and axial length (AL). The mean follow-up period after diagnosis was 11.0 \u00B1 5.5 years. Central and mean macular thicknesses were also significantly higher in the acromegaly group (p \u003C 0.05). Superior, inferior, and average RNFL thicknesses were also significantly thinner in the acromegaly group (p \u003C 0.05). When OCTA parameters were compared between groups, there was a significant decrease in central vessel density (CVD) and central perfusion density (CPD) values in all regions in acromegaly group compared with controls (p \u003C 0.05).

However, widespread community transmission, as is currently being observed in the United States, requires more expansive transmission events between nonhousehold contacts. In February and March 2020, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) investigated a large, multifamily cluster of COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts were interviewed to better understand nonhousehold, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This report describes the cluster of 16 cases of confirmed or probable COVID-19, including three deaths, likely resulting from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at two family gatherings (a funeral and a birthday party).

However, changes in metabolism after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are not clearly known. This study investigated the change in IGFBP3 levels in obesity after bariatric surgery. METHODS We evaluated 36 patients with obesity (14 males, aged 31.36 \u00B1 7.06 years and 22 females, aged 32.55 \u00B1 11.40 years) at baseline and 3 months after SG. Changes in their IGF1, IGFBP3, and IGF1/IGFBP3 ratios and glucose-lipid metabolic, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters were measured. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure their IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels. RESULTS (1) IGFBP3 levels were negatively associated with waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = - 0.482, P = 0.043; r = - 0.503, P = 0.033); total IGF1 levels were negatively associated with body mass index and WC (r = - 0.569, P = 0.014; r = - 0.470, P = 0.048); and free IGF1 levels were negatively related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 level independent of age (r = - 0.544, P = 0.020).

CONCLUSIONS Loopholes in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments are due to poor understanding of the emerging disease which can be fixed by establishing an isolation zone for patients not completely cleared of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Juan; Ding, Ning; Chen, Huan; Liu, Xia-Jing; Pu, Zu-Hui; Xu, Hua-Jian; Lei, Yi; Zhang, Han-Wen","journal":"Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l\u0027Association canadienne des radiologistes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0846537120916852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection control","prevention practices","possibility of infection","radiology departments","care-associated COVID","diagnostic criteria of COVID","coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","transmission","SARS viruses","isolation zone","CONCLUSIONS Loopholes","contagious coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","poor understanding","limited understanding","emerging disease","handling patients","cases of health","loophole identification","METHODS Retrospective analysis","rectifying measurements","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Previous work has begun to develop interventions to reduce individual meat consumption, often by appealing directly to individual health motivations. However, research on nutritional behavior change suggests that interventions additionally linking behavior to ethical values, identity formation, and existing social movements may be particularly effective and longer-lasting. Regarding meat consumption, preliminary evidence and psychological theory suggest that appeals related to animal welfare may have considerable potential to effectively leverage these elements of human psychology. We aim to conduct a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of animal welfare-related appeals on actual or intended meat consumption or purchasing. Our investigation will critically synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding psychological mechanisms of intervening on individual meat consumption and empirically identify the psychological characteristics underlying the most effective animal welfare-based interventions. METHODS We will systematically search eight academic databases and extensively search unpublished grey literature. We will include studies that assess interventions intended to reduce meat consumption or purchase through the mention or portrayal of animal welfare, that measure outcomes related to meat consumption or purchase, and that have a control condition. Eligible studies may recruit from any human population, be written in any language, and be published or released any time. We will meta-analyze the studies, reporting the pooled point estimate and additional metrics that describe the distribution of potentially heterogeneous effects. We will assess studies\u0027 risk of bias and conduct sensitivity analyses for publication bias. We describe possible follow-up analyses to investigate hypothesized moderators of intervention effectiveness. DISCUSSION The findings of the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis, including any identified methodological limitations of the existing literature, could inform the design of successful evidence-based interventions with broad potential to improve human, animal, and environmental well-being.

Remote video auditing (RVA) is a tool that can monitor reprocessing compliance but it has not been previously evaluated in a tertiary care setting. The aims of this study were to evaluate: 1) RVA feasibility in a tertiary care setting (defined as the ability to audit every step of duodenoscope reprocessing without delaying the next procedure due to unavailability of duodenoscopes); and 2) the use of RVA as a compliance monitoring tool. METHODS : This was a prospective study at a tertiary care center. A video camera with offsite monitoring was installed in March 2018. Auditors delivered a compliance score after each procedure. The duodenoscope was not used until it passed the audit. Feasibility and compliance data were collected from April 2018 to August 2019 after a 1-month run-in phase. Both per-step compliance and overall 100 % compliance rates were measured. RESULTS : Of 743 duodenoscope reprocessing procedures, 32 666 individual steps were audited and 99.9 % of the steps were fully viewable. The mean time per audit was 38.3 minutes, the mean duodenoscope turnover time was 76.1 minutes, and there were no delays to the next procedure due to unavailability of duodenoscopes.

Protein acetylation is known to play a crucial role in host response to viral infection. Acetylation of viral proteins encoded by other RNA viruses have been reported to affect viral replication. It is therefore of interest to see whether MERS-CoV proteins are also acetylated. Viral proteins obtained from infected cells were trypsin-digested into peptides. Acetylated peptides were enriched by immunoprecipitation and subject to nano-LC-Orbitrap analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess the conservation level of identified acetylation sites and to predict the upstream regulatory factors. A total of 12 acetylation sites were identified from 7 peptides, which all belong to the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. All identified acetylation sites were found to be highly conserved across MERS-CoV sequences in NCBI database. Upstream factors, including deacetylases of the SIRT1 and HDAC families as well as acetyltransferases of the TIP60 family, were predicted to be responsible for regulating the acetylation events identified. Western blot confirms that acetylation events indeed occur on pp1ab protein by expressing NSP4 in HEK293 cells. Acetylation events on MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab were identified for the first time, which indicate that MERS-CoV might use the host acetylation machinery to regulate its enzyme activity and to achieve optimal replication. Upstream factors were predicted, which might facilitate further analysis of the regulatory mechanism of MERS-CoV replication.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Lin; Fung, Sin-Yee; Xie, Guangshan; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Jin, Dong Yan; Cai, Zongwei","journal":"Molecular \u0026 cellular proteomics : MCP","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra119.001897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","NCBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Protein acetylation","acetylation events","Acetylation of viral proteins","MERS-CoV proteins","MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab","MERS-CoV sequences","CoV replication","host acetylation machinery","viral replication","conservation level of identified acetylation sites","regulatory mechanism of MERS","viral infection","pp1ab protein","Upstream factors","upstream regulatory factors","Acetylated peptides","Orbitrap analysis","optimal replication","Bioinformatic analysis","replicase polyprotein pp1ab","host response","HEK293 cells","infected cells","enzyme activity","nano-LC","subject","immunoprecipitation","deacetylases","crucial role","acetyltransferases","HDAC families","SIRT1","trypsin","NSP4","NCBI database","life-threatening disease","RNA viruses","Western blot","potential","TIP60 family","time","total","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

A 2010 UK review reported growing awareness of telehealth in palliative care but a lack of evidence-based research to support its use. The primary aim of this review was to describe the current use of telehealth in palliative care in the UK and evaluate telehealth initiatives against a digital service standard. The secondary aim was to explore whether telehealth results in a reduction in emergency care access. METHODS Systematic review of the literature with thematic synthesis. Records were screened and data extracted by two reviewers. EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psychinfo and Cochrane central register for controlled trials were searched using pre-defined terms. Hand searching of conference literature, thesis databases and citation tracking was also conducted. The protocol for this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO and can be found at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42017080038. RESULTS The search identified 3807 titles and 30 studies were included in the review. Telehealth was used to support patients and carers, electronic record keeping and professional education. Notably, the number of home telemonitoring initiatives for patients had increased from the 2010 review. Despite this variety, many studies were small scale, descriptive and provided little evidence of evaluation of the service. Ten papers were sufficiently detailed to allow appraisal against the digital service standard and only one of these met all of the criteria to some extent. Seven studies made reference to emergency care access. CONCLUSIONS Although there is growth of telehealth services, there remains a lack of evaluation and robust study design meaning conclusions regarding the clinical application of telehealth in palliative care cannot be drawn. There is insufficient evidence to appreciate any benefit of telehealth on access to emergency care. Future work is needed to evaluate the use of telehealth in palliative care and improve telehealth design in line with digital service standards.","publish_time":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hancock, Sophie; Preston, Nancy; Jones, Helen; Gadoud, Amy","journal":"BMC palliative care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-019-0495-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31835998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Telehealth","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["telehealth design","telehealth initiatives","telehealth results","benefit of telehealth","BACKGROUND Telehealth","palliative care services","current use of telehealth","emergency care access","clinical application of telehealth","growing awareness of telehealth","growth of telehealth services","UK review","studies","METHODS Systematic review","digital service standards","lack of evidence","lack of evaluation","little evidence of evaluation","patients","CONCLUSIONS","insufficient evidence","conference literature","primary aim","secondary aim","robust study design","number of home telemonitoring initiatives","controlled trials","Psychinfo","Cochrane central register","CINAHL","solution","thesis databases","small scale","electronic record","reduction","citation tracking","MEDLINE","carers","based research","appraisal","pressures","pre-defined terms","reference","professional education","thematic synthesis","EMBASE","Hand","variety","titles","protocol","PROSPERO","Future work","criteria","extent","Records","reviewers","papers"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus has now spread to all of the continents. We aimed to consider clinical characteristics, laboratory data of COVID-19 that provided more information for the research of this novel virus. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19. These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. RESULTS Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged. Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P\u003C 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P\u003C 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities. Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death.

This scoping review identifies studies of interventions to increase uptake of cervical screening among women in the region and uses the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM) to describe how interventions might work. METHODS A systematic search of literature was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL databases through May 2019. Screening and data charting were performed by two independent reviewers. Intervention studies measuring changes to uptake in screening among women in SSA were included, with no restriction to intervention type, study setting or date, or participant characteristics. Intervention type and implementation strategies were described using behavioral constructs from the IBM. RESULTS Of the 3704 citations the search produced, 19 studies were selected for inclusion. Most studies were published between 2014 and 2019 (78.9%) and were set in Nigeria (47.4%) and South Africa (26.3%). Studies most often assessed screening with Pap smears (31.6%) and measured uptake as ever screened (42.1%) or screened during the study period (36.8%). Education-based interventions were most common (57.9%) and the IBM construct of knowledge/skills to perform screening was targeted most frequently (68.4%). Willingness to screen was high, before and after intervention. Screening coverage ranged from 1.7 to 99.2% post-intervention, with six studies (31.6%) reporting a significant improvement in screening that achieved \u226560% coverage. CONCLUSIONS Educational interventions were largely ineffective, except those that utilized peer or community health educators and mHealth implementation strategies. Two economic incentivization interventions were moderately effective, by acting on participants\u0027 instrumental attitudes, but resulted in screening coverage less than 20%. Innovative service delivery, including community-based self-sampling, acted on environmental constraints, striving to make services more available, accessible, and appropriate to women, and were the most effective. This review demonstrates that intent to perform screening may not be the major determinant of screening behavior, suggesting other theoretical frameworks may be needed to more fully understand uptake of cervical screening in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly for health systems change interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lott, Breanne E; Trejo, Mario J; Baum, Christina; McClelland, D Jean; Adsul, Prajakta; Madhivanan, Purnima; Carvajal, Scott; Ernst, Kacey; Ehiri, John","journal":"BMC public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08777-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSA","Integrated Behavioral","IBM","Pap"],"locations":["Nigeria","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["Screening coverage","studies of interventions","low uptake of cervical screening","Intervention studies","major determinant of screening behavior","intervention type","measured uptake","women","Education-based interventions","post-intervention","staging of cervical cancer","CONCLUSIONS Educational interventions","economic incentivization interventions","SSA","South Africa","experiences disproportionate burden of cervical cancer incidence","community health educators","mHealth implementation strategies","IBM construct of knowledge","BACKGROUND Sub-Saharan Africa","health systems","behavioral constructs","scoping review","study period","Integrated Behavioral Model","systematic search of literature","mortality","region","Embase","PubMed","peer","date","prevention","strategy","Web of Science","changes","self-sampling","services","environmental constraints","skills","restriction","participants\u0027 instrumental attitudes","data charting","Innovative service delivery","CINAHL databases","METHODS","theoretical frameworks","citations","Pap smears","independent reviewers","participant characteristics","Willingness","RESULTS","significant improvement","intent","Nigeria","inclusion"],"language":"en"},

Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high-quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto-immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID-19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease. In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyerowitz, Eric A; Vannier, Augustin G L; Friesen, Morgan G N; Schoenfeld, Sara; Gelfand, Jeffrey A; Callahan, Michael V; Kim, Arthur Y; Reeves, Patrick M; Poznansky, Mark C","journal":"FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["agents","treatment of COVID","viral infections","use","high-quality clinical data","respiratory viral infection","inhibition of viral proliferation","data collection","treatment of auto","coronavirus disease","blockade of viral fusion","direct inhibition of viral replication","randomized clinical trials","data informed opinion","increasing number of patients","context","immune conditions","case basis","clear benefit","impact of HCQ","potent immunomodulatory effects","adaptive antiviral immune responses","risks","immunologic consequences","suppression of antigen presentation","cytokine production","broad range of adverse events","benefits","rigorous consideration","thoughtful planning","nucleoside","tide analogs","approved treatments","component","Early anecdotal reports","significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine","harm","original rationale","lesser extent chloroquine","growing uncertainty","therapeutic approach","addition","utility","facts","potential","article","datasets","caution","role","evidence"],"language":"en"},

But controversies still exist regarding its potential advantages and risks, especially for emergency surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a single-port laparoscopic repair using straight laparoscopic instruments for the treatment of perforated duodenal ulcers. METHODS A prospective consecutive case series was conducted including all patients with a perforated duodenal ulcer who underwent a laparoscopic single-port repair at a single institution from January 2012 to June 2018. The operation was performed through a single port using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments and intra-corporeal knot tying techniques. RESULTS Out of 75 patients, simple closure of the perforation without omental patch was accomplished in 96% of cases. Conversion to an open operation was required in one patient (1.3%) due to a posterior duodenal perforation, and additional trocar placement was needed in another patient (1.3%). The mean incision length was 2.0 \u00B1 0.2 cm. The mean operation time was 63.0 \u00B1 26.6 min. Meantime a nasogastric tube remained in place was 2.9 \u00B1 0.8 days. Mean duration of analgesic use was 2.8 \u00B1 0.8 days. The rate of postoperative complications was 2.7%, including two patients with wound infections. There were no instances of intestinal leak or abscess. The postoperative hospital stay was 5.7 \u00B1 1.2 days. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic single-port repair using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments with intra-corporeal knot tying technique was safe and feasible for patients with perforated duodenal ulcers with low risk factors. This method offers results comparable to those expected with the standard multiport laparoscopic approach with the addition of improved cosmetic outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Tri Huu; Dang, Thanh Nhu; Schnelldorfer, Thomas","journal":"World journal of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-019-05352-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31897688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single-port laparoscopic repair","single port","CONCLUSION Laparoscopic single-port repair","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic single-port surgery","conventional straight laparoscopic instruments","patients","single institution","days","standard multiport laparoscopic approach","treatment of perforated duodenal ulcers","posterior duodenal perforation","mean operation time","intra-corporeal knot","open operation","results comparable","mean incision length","Mean duration of analgesic use","emergency surgery","postoperative hospital stay","rate of postoperative complications","treatment of various abdominal conditions","additional trocar placement","low risk factors","addition of improved cosmetic outcomes","prospective consecutive case series","simple closure","Meantime","METHODS","risks","techniques","potential advantages","omental patch","instances of intestinal leak","abscess","nasogastric tube","controversies","study","Conversion","wound infections","aim","cases"],"language":"en"},

There is no specific medicine available for treating the disease. Luckily, traditional Chinese medicine has played a positive role in the fighting against COVID-19. In this paper, We collected and sorted the prescriptions of modern Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released by national government, different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as well as online databases, such as CNKI, WanFang medical network, and VIP database. These prescriptions were combined with the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine auxiliary V2.5, and the complex system entropy clustering method was used to determine the association rules and frequency of single drug and drug combination in the prescription. In the end, 96 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the four properties were mainly concentrated in temperature, cold and level, the five tastes were mainly concentrated in bitter, hot and sweet, and the meridians were mainly concentrated in lung, stomach and spleen. The high-frequency drugs were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, etc., and the high-frequency combinations are Gypsum Fibrosum-Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, the core combinations are Lepidii Semen-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba-Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens-Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ophiopogonis Radix-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Scutellariae Radix and so on.

After reviewing the medical records of 52 patients with a pathologically confirmed vestibular schwannoma, we included 50 patient\u0027s records in the study. Hearing preservation was regarded as positive if the postoperative hearing was within serviceable hearing (50/50 rule). The categorical variable included the surgical approach, and the continuous variable covered audiometric and vestibular function tests, and the largest diameter of the tumor. Four different algorithms were lined up for comparison of accuracy: support vector machine(SVM), gradient boosting machine(GBM), deep neural network(DNN), and diffuse random forest(DRF). The average accuracy of predicting hearing preservation ranged from 62% (SVM) to 90% (DNN).

No clear data are available concerning this question based on T-category. METHODS Two groups of patients with esophagectomy and high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy for eAC were analyzed: hybrid (laparoscopy \u002B right thoracotomy) (n = 835) and open (laparotomy \u002B right thoracotomy) (n = 188). Outcome criteria were 30- and 90-day mortality, R0-resection rate (R0), number of resected lymph nodes (rLNs), and 5-year survival rate (5y-SR). For each type of surgery, three patient groups were analyzed: pT1-carcinoma (group-1), cT3Nx and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (group-2), and pT3N0-3 without neoadjuvant therapy (group-3). The comparison was based on a propensity score matching in relation of 1:2 for open versus hybrid. RESULTS In group-1 (38 open vs 76 hybrid) R0-resection (100%), 30-day mortality (0%), 90-day mortality (2.6% vs 0%), and rLNs (median 29.5 vs 28.5) were not significantly different. The pN0-rate was 76% in the open and 92% in the hybrid group (p = 0.036). Accordingly, the 5y-SR was 69% and 87% (p = 0.016), but the prognosis of the subgroups pT1pN0 or pT1pN\u002B was not significantly different between open or hybrid. In group-2 (68 open vs 135 hybrid) R0-resection (97%), 30-day (0% vs 0.7%) and 90-day (4%) mortality, rLNs (28.5 vs 26), and 5y-SR (36% vs 41%) were not significantly different. In group-3 (37 open vs 75 hybrid) R0, postoperative mortality, rLNs, and 5y-SR were not significantly different.

METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only. RESULTS A total of 1063 patients underwent randomization. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group. Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P\u003C0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04). Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the probability of reinfection in the recovered class and the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E_0 ) state for COVID-19 coronavirus. The model differential equation was evaluated for the disease-free equilibrium for the case of reinfection as well as existence and stability criteria for the disease using the model proportions. This evaluation shows that the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R_0=0 is satisfied. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B=0. With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study was carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. As shown by the results, the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Victor, Alexander Okhuese","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rate of reinfection","recovered class","great number of recovered population","recovery rate","rate of incidence","death rate","study","proportion of infected population","disease-free equilibrium","case of reinfection","probability of reinfection","stability criteria","model equations","model proportions","model differential equation","asymptotic stability","infected cases","analytical results","basic reproductive number R","Polymerase Chain Reaction","human host","test","global health community","existence","observatory procedures","implementation of quarantine","sensitivity","PCR","effect","state","numerical simulations","absence of curative vaccination","secondary reinfections","projection","COVID","presence","ratio of infection","system","coronavirus","chance","total","spread","evaluation","time","objective"],"language":"en"},

Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients. RESULTS Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In Case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In Case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.

OBJECTIVES The anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic actions of Diclofenac were compared with apigenin-C-glycosides rich Clinacanthus nutans (CN) leaf extract in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats. METHODS Female Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 6). Four groups were bilateral ovariectomised for osteoporosis development, and osteoarthritis were induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee joints. The Sham group was sham-operated, received saline injection and deionized drinking water. The treatment groups were orally given 200 or 400 mg extract/kg body weight or 5 mg diclofenac /kg body weight daily for 28 days. Articular cartilage and bone changes were monitored by gross and histological structures, micro-CT analysis, serum protein biomarkers, and mRNA expressions for inflammation and catabolic protease genes. RESULTS HPLC analysis confirmed that apigenin-C-glycosides (shaftoside, vitexin, and isovitexin) were the major compounds in the extract. The extract significantly and dose-dependently reduced cartilage erosion, bone loss, cartilage catabolic changes, serum osteoporotic-osteoarthritis biomarkers (procollagen-type-II-N-terminal-propeptide PIINP; procollagen-type-I-N-terminal-propeptide PINP; osteocalcin), inflammation (IL-1\u03B2) and mRNA expressions for nuclear-factor-kappa-beta NF-\u03BA\u03B2, interleukin-1-beta IL-1\u03B2, cyclooxygenase-2; and matrix-metalloproteinase-13 MMP13 activities, in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats comparable to Diclofenac.

OBJECTIVES To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize research findings on the associations between acceptance, quality of life (QOL), and mental health outcomes in individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS Five databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched. Studies were included if they provided findings on the association between acceptance and QOL, mental health outcomes, or both in an SCI population aged 16 years or older. Only peer-reviewed original quantitative and qualitative studies were included. Screening, quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted independently by two researchers. Findings were tabulated and synthesized by outcome. RESULTS Forty-one studies were included. Greater acceptance was consistently associated with greater global and psychological QOL, life satisfaction, sense of well-being, mental health, and with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Inconsistent evidence was found with regards to social QOL and post-traumatic stress disorder. Acceptance was generally not associated with adjustment outcomes further than 2 years into the future. Study quality of the quantitative studies was mostly fair (n = 17) followed by good (n = 13), and poor (n = 9). CONCLUSION Health-care professionals may regard acceptance as a psychological resource they can aim to support in improving QOL and mental health following SCI.

METHODS Systematic review. DATA SOURCES The MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO databases were searched from database inception to 9th March 2018. Specific criteria were used to define inclusion and exclusion. Data was extracted independently by a pair of reviewers. RESULTS In total 32 cross sectional studies were identified for inclusion (1 with a longitudinal component). The median prevalence of wrist pain in the general population and non-manual workers within the short term (within last week) was 6 and 4.2% within the medium term (\u003E 1 week and within a year). The median prevalence of wrist pain in physically demanding occupations and sports people was 10% within the short term and 24% within the medium term. Non-modifiable factors associated with wrist pain included increased age (1 study in adults and 3 studies in children/adolescents) and female sex (2 studies). Modifiable risk factors included high job physical strain (2 studies), high job psychological strain (1 study), abnormal physeal morphology in children/adolescents (2 studies), high frequency impact tool use (1 study) and effort reward imbalance (1 study). CONCLUSIONS Wrist pain is highly prevalent in groups who partake in physically demanding activities from day to day such as manual labourers and sportspeople. It is less prevalent in the general population and non-manual workers, although there is a relative lack of research in the general population.

Human cardiosphere-derived cells (hCDCs) are taken into consideration as a promising cell resource in cell therapy in recent years. In this study, we designed an electrochemical stimulation system, which sends square pulses to the hCDCs and records their electrical response. Morphology, viability and differentiation of hCDCs are monitored at certain time courses of the treatment. Differentiating hCDCs aligned perpendicularly with respect to the direction of applied electric current, and obtained a spindle-like morphology, while they remained viable. At the same time, specific cardiac marker genes including GATA4, cTnT and \u03B1-MHC showed a considerable up-regulation. Our findings confirm that hCDCs differentiate to committed cardiomyocytes when hCDCs receive an electrical energy of 0.06 - 0.12 Wh. This amount of electrical energy could be applied to the stem cells using versatile electrical stimulation patterns via commercially available devices.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazari, Hojjatollah; Kehtari, Mousa; Rad, Iman; Ashtari, Behnaz; Joghataei, Mohammad Taghi","journal":"Molecular and cellular biochemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-020-03742-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["differentiation of hCDCs","electrical energy","electrical response","versatile electrical stimulation patterns","Morphology","cell therapy","stem cells","heart regeneration","promising cell resource","electrochemical stimulation system","certain time courses","Human cardiosphere-derived cells","Logistic complexities of heart transplantation","direction of applied electric current","GATA4","cTnT","specific cardiac marker genes","\u03B1-MHC","necessity","novel methods","recent years","available devices","square pulses","respect","consideration","cardiomyocytes","spindle","treatment","viability","regulation","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Medical students, as frontline healthcare workers, are more susceptible to be infected by the virus. The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, self-reported preventive behaviors and risk perception among Iranian medical students within the first week after the onset of the outbreak in Iran. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted from 26th to 28th of February, 2020. Participants were Iranian medical students (5th-7th year) whose knowledge, preventive behaviors and risk perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions including 15 items about COVID-19 related knowledge, 9 items regarding preventive measures and 2 items about COVID-19 risk perception. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were shown to be satisfactory. RESULTS A total of 240 medical students completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 23.67 years. The average of correct answers of knowledge was 86.96%; and 79.60% had high level of related knowledge. The average rate of practicing preventive behaviors was 94.47%; and 94.2% had high level of performance in preventive behaviors. The cumulative score of risk perception was 4.08 out of 8 which was in moderate range. Risk perception was significantly different between stagers and interns and between those being trained in emergency room (ER) and non-ER wards. There was a significant negative correlation between preventive behaviors and risk perception. CONCLUSION We found a high level of COVID-19 related knowledge and self-reported preventive behaviors and moderate risk perception among Iranian medical students.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taghrir, Mohammad Hossein; Borazjani, Roham; Shiraly, Ramin","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["moderate risk perception","risk perceptions of COVID","self-reported preventive behaviors","Iranian medical students","preventive measures","high level of related knowledge","high level of COVID","cumulative score of risk perception","items","average of correct answers of knowledge","online questionnaire","high level of performance","moderate range","average rate","cross-sectional study","non-ER wards","mean age of participants","frontline healthcare workers","week","significant negative correlation","stagers","emergency room","novel coronavirus disease","onset","outbreak","years","questions","interns","METHODS","validity","reliability","journey","CONCLUSION","total","world","BACKGROUND","aim"],"language":"en"},

Comprehensive, high-quality data on the health workforce are essential to identifying gaps in health service provision, as well as informing future health workforce and health services planning, and health policy. While many data sources are used in Australia for these purposes, the quality of the data sources with respect to relevance, accessibility and accuracy is not clear. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review aims to identify and appraise publicly available data sources describing the Australian health workforce. The review will include any data source (eg, registry, administrative database and survey) or document reporting a data source (eg, journal article, report) on the Australian health workforce, which is publicly available and describes the characteristics of the workforce. The search will be conducted in 10 bibliographic databases and the grey literature using an iterative process. Screening of titles and abstracts will be undertaken by two investigators, independently, using Covidence software. Any disagreement between investigators will be resolved by a third investigator. Documents/data sources identified as potentially eligible will be retrieved in full text and reviewed following the same process. Data will be extracted using a customised data extraction tool. A customised appraisal tool will be used to assess the relevance, accessibility and accuracy of included data sources. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The scoping review is a secondary analysis of existing, publicly available data sources and does not require ethics approval. The findings of this scoping review will further our understanding of the quality and availability of data sources used for health workforce and health services planning in Australia. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences targeted at health workforce and public health topics.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gillam, Marianne; Leach, Matthew; Muller, Jessica; Gonzalez-Chica, David; Jones, Martin; Muyambi, Kuda; Walsh, Sandra; May, Esther","journal":"BMJ open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31969370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Comprehensive","ETHICS"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["Australian health workforce","available data sources","future health workforce","availability of data sources","health policy","high-quality data","accuracy of included data sources","health services planning","public health topics","health service provision","customised data extraction tool","scoping review","accessibility","relevance","investigators","customised appraisal tool","ethics approval","iterative process","secondary analysis of existing","peer-reviewed journals","gaps","respect","integral component","grey literature","survey","registry","conferences","report","administrative database","journal article","publication","DISSEMINATION","understanding","bibliographic databases","healthcare system","abstracts","METHODS","purposes","INTRODUCTION","Screening of titles","Covidence software","text","findings","characteristics","Documents","search","results","disagreement"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we examine what we identify as key traits of Cuban health security, as they play out on both international and domestic fronts. We argue that Cuba demonstrates a strong health security capacity, both in terms of its health systems support and crisis response activities internationally, and its domestic disease control activities rooted in an integrated health system with a focus on universal healthcare. Health security in Cuba, however, also faces challenges. These concern Cuba\u0027s visibility and participation in the broader global health security architecture, the social controls exercised by the state in managing disease threats in Cuban territory, and the resource constraints facing the island-in particular, the effects of the US embargo. While Cuba does not frame its disease control activities within the discourse of health security, we argue that the Cuban case demonstrates that it is possible to make strides to improve capacity for health security in resource-constrained settings. The successes and challenges facing health security in Cuba, moreover, provide points of reflection relevant to the pursuit of health security globally and are thus worth further consideration in broader health security discussions.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wenham, Clare; Kittelsen, Sonja K","journal":"BMJ global health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409329/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cuba"],"keyphrases":["discourse of health security","pursuit of health security","health systems","broader health security discussions","strong health security capacity","domestic health system","broader global health security architecture","contemporary global health security debates","key traits of Cuban health security","integrated health system","domestic disease control activities","Cuban territory","disease threats","Cuban case","domestic fronts","challenges","crisis response activities","policy discourse","resource constraints","concern Cuba\u0027s visibility","resource-constrained settings","Cuba\u0027s history of medical internationalism","participation","social controls","state","focus","consideration","terms","points of reflection relevant","effects","island","strides","universal healthcare","successes","US embargo","paper"],"language":"en"},

PARPi\u0027s can effectively decrease IL-6, IL-1 and TNF\u03B1 levels (key interleukins in SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials.

This is due to the rapid release of the electrostatic potential energy of the coil during translocation, leading to an effectively attractive force that assists end-driven translocation.

In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12\u00B1 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24\u00B1 0.01), (P\u003C0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12\u00B1 0.02 vs. 0.25\u00B1 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P\u003C0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P\u003C0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P\u003C0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries.

However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients. Methods: We analysed data from 52 confirmed patients who had been discharged with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were dynamically recorded and compared with the admission and follow-up RT-PCR results. Results: In this cohort, 52 admitted COVID-19 patients who had confirmed positive RT-PCR results were discharged after 2 rounds of consecutively negative RT-PCR results. Compared with admission levels, CRP levels (median 4.93 mg/L [IQR: 1.78-10.20]) decreased significantly (p\u003C0.001). and lymphocyte counts (median 1.50\u00D7109/L [IQR: 1.11-1.88]) increased obviously after obtaining negative RT-PCR results (p\u003C0.001). Additionally, substantially improved inflammatory exudation was observed on chest CT except for 2 progressed patients. At the two-week follow-up after discharge, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results, including the abovementioned 2 progressed patients. Among the 7 patients, new GGO was demonstrated in 2 patients. There were no significant differences in CPR levels or lymphocyte counts when comparing the negative and re-positive PCT results (all p \u003E0.05). Conclusion: Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients with negative RT-PCR results.

The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ram\u00F3n Mart\u00EDnez Riera, Jos\u00E9; Gras-Nieto, Elvira","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ca52d030693ebe87eb8b2a2fcbba5e3ca1b4c18.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1130862120302990; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1130862120302990?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Home Care","care of people","telephone care","fundamental tool of Primary Health Care","health service","digital health offers","community participation","closure of health centers","healthcare professionals","circulation of professionals","incorporation of people","pandemic situation","monitoring of infected people","public participation","research projects","hospital setting","desirable community perspective","main focus of infection","exacerbated hospital-centrism","advanced chronic diseases","tools","terminal illnesses","extreme precautions","control","technique","special importance","video calls","detriment of PHC","high contagion","dementia","COPD","attention","hospitals","family","Spain","uneven development","account recommendations","homes","clear risk factor","relevant role","families","process","caregivers","Abstract","autonomous communities","crisis","time","COVID","settings","addition"],"language":"en"},

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) is becoming a serious concern with increasing patient morbidity, mortality, and lengths of hospital stay. Therefore, the rapid detection of CRA is essential for epidemiological surveillance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been extensively used for the rapid identification of most pathogens. In this study, we have developed two multiplex real-time PCR assays to detect and differentiate A. baumannii and non-A. baumannii Acinetobacter spp, and common carbapenemase genes, including bla(NDM), bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like), and bla(OXA-58-like). We demonstrate the potential utility of these assays for the direct detection of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA in clinical specimens. Primers were specifically designed, and two multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed: multiplex real-time PCR assay1 for the detection of Acinetobacter baumannii 16S\u201323S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence, the Acinetobacter recA gene, and class-B-metalloenzyme-encoding gene bla(NDM); and multiplex real-time PCR assay2 to detect class-D-oxacillinase-encoding genes (bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like),and bla(OXA-58-like)). The assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System. CRA isolates were used to compare the assays with conventional PCR and sequencing. Known amounts of CRA cells were added to sputum and fecal specimens and used to test the multiplex real-time PCR assays. The results for target and nontarget amplification showed that the multiplex real-time PCR assays were specific, the limit of detection for each target was 10 copies per 20 \u03BCL reaction volume, the assays were linear over six log dilutions of the target genes (r(2) \u003E 0.99), and the Ct values of the coefficients of variation for intra- and interassay reproducibility were less than 5%. The multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR when tested against 400 CRA isolates and their sensitivity for the target DNA in sputum and fecal specimens was 10(2) CFU/mL. Therefore, these novel multiplex real-time PCR assays allow the sensitive and specific characterization and differentiation of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA, making them potential tools for the direct detection of CRA in clinical specimens and the surveillance of nosocomial infections.","publish_time":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Qiu; Rui, Yongyu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e50303039d019b3f817743da8a21e60f3b99130.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4938629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4938629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRA","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene bla","differentiation of bla","direct detection of bla","novel multiplex real-time PCR assays","real-time PCR assay1","real-time PCR assay2","conventional PCR","FAST Real-Time PCR System","direct detection of CRA","rapid detection of CRA","positive CRA","CRA isolates","detection of Acinetobacter baumannii","NDM","target genes","amounts of CRA cells","baumannii Acinetobacter spp","limit of detection","clinical specimens","fecal specimens","Acinetobacter recA gene","Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter","target DNA","sputum","surveillance of nosocomial infections","common carbapenemase genes","specific characterization","class-B","class-D","potential tools","epidemiological surveillance","potential utility","rapid identification","\u03BCL reaction volume","Polymerase chain reaction","S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence","mortality","increasing patient morbidity","ABI Prism","coefficients of variation","serious concern","log dilutions","nontarget amplification","copies","sensitivity","metalloenzyme","concordance","oxacillinase","interassay reproducibility","Ct values","lengths of hospital","results","sequencing","pathogens","carbapenems","CFU","study","Primers"],"language":"en"},

A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by cross-linking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells. This study significantly increases the number of cellular factors known to interact with DENV and reveals how DENV modulates and usurps cellular proteins for efficient amplification.","publish_time":"2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viktorovskaya, Olga V.; Greco, Todd M.; Cristea, Ileana M.; Thompson, Sunnie R.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d6e09ce2559ff9fcb55f3351110880446b477fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4996428.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4996428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","DENV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV RNA","cellular proteins","DENV amplification","DENV infection","abundances of proteins","cellular RNA binding proteins","transporter proteins","cross-linking proteins","dengue viral RNA","viral host factors","novel RNA binding proteins","RNA viruses","viral amplification","dengue virus infection","identification of host factors","number of cellular factors","viral RNAs","efficient amplification","live infection","host pathogen interaction","dengue hemorrhagic fever","unrelated virus","diverse viruses","protein abundances","distinct mechanisms","specific recruitment mechanisms","protein knockdown","human cells","particular classes","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","vaccines","antivirals available","cell fitness","function","specialized role","translation","better understanding","stability","avenue","evidence","global proteome level","effective therapies","ubiquitin proteasome pathway","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODOLOGY","poliovirus","death","localization","requirement","CONCLUSIONS","replication","study","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This axis is emerging as a novel target to attenuate ocular inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the activity of the protective axis of RAS by subretinal delivery of an AAV8 (Y733F)-ACE2 vector would protect against the ocular inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice through regulating the local immune responses. Our studies demonstrated that increased ACE2 expression exerts protective effects on inflammation in EAU mouse by modulating ocular immune responses, including the differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells and the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages; whereas the systemic immune responses appeared not affected. These effects were mediated by activating the Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas and inhibiting the MAPK, NF-\u03BAB and STAT3 signaling pathways.

Senescence was induced in human fetal astrocytes by transient oxidative stress. Brain-expressed genes, including those involved in neuronal development and differentiation, were downregulated in senescent astrocytes. Remarkably, several genes indicative of astrocytic responses to injury were also downregulated, including glial fibrillary acidic protein and genes involved in the processing and presentation of antigens by major histocompatibility complex class II proteins, while pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated.

Revealing the evolutionary processes that allow novel pathogens to adapt to new hosts, also the potential barriers to host adaptation, is central to understanding the drivers of disease emergence. In particular, it is unclear how the genetics and ecology of pathogens interact to shape the likelihood of successful cross-species transmission. To better understand the determinants of host adaptation and emergence, we modelled key aspects of pathogen evolutionary dynamics at both intra- and inter-host scales, using parameter values similar to those observed in influenza virus. We considered the possibility of acquiring the necessary host adaptive mutations both before (\u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 emergence) and after (\u2018tailor-made\u2019 emergence) a virus is transmitted from a donor to a new recipient species. Under both scenarios, population bottlenecks at inter-host transmission act as a major barrier to host adaptation, greatly limiting the number of adaptive mutations that are able to cross the species barrier. In addition, virus emergence is hindered if the fitness valley between the donor and recipient hosts is either too steep or too shallow. Overall, our results reveal where in evolutionary parameter space a virus could adapt to and become transmissible in a new species.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Senior, Alistair M.; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"Proc Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6695ddb328b70ecd7517344adc97169eb768c5e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5013787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5013787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus emergence","new species","determinants of host adaptation","inter-host scales","new recipient species","species barrier","inter-host transmission act","necessary host adaptive mutations","new hosts","influenza virus","drivers of disease emergence","major barrier","evolutionary parameter space","recipient hosts","evolutionary processes","donor","likelihood of successful cross-species transmission","number of adaptive mutations","major challenge","novel pathogens","ecology of pathogens","key aspects of pathogen evolutionary dynamics","parameter values similar","population bottlenecks","fitness valley","potential barriers","scenarios","Emerging diseases","public health","genetics","results","possibility","tailor-made","addition"],"language":"en"},

Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinant FMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A(24) Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers were further compared to 2 na\u00EFve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers. Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response\u2013such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells\u2013were significantly overrepresented.

Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus (IAV) to induce host shutoff. We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

These results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of endotoxemia and the beneficial effect of choline administration in this clinical situation. METHODS: Healthy-calves (n = 20) were divided into 4 groups: Control, Choline treated (C), Lipopolysaccharide administered (LPS), and LPS \u002B C. Control calves received 0.9 % NaCl injection. Calves in C and LPS \u002B C groups received choline chloride (1 mg/kg/iv). Endotoxin (LPS) was injected (2 \u03BCg/kg/iv) to the calves in LPS and LPS \u002B C groups. Serum samples were collected before and after the treatments. Differentially expressed proteins (\u003E 1.5 fold-change relative to controls) were identified by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: After LPS administration, 14 proteins increased, and 13 proteins decreased within 48 h as compared to controls. In the LPS group, there were significant increases in serum levels of ragulator complex protein (189-fold) and galectin-3-binding protein (10-fold), but transcription factor MafF and corticosteroid binding globulin were down regulated (\u2265 5 fold). As compared with the LPS group, in LPS \u002B C group, fibrinogen gamma-B-chain and antithrombin were up-regulated, while hemopexin and histone H4 were down-regulated. Choline treatment attenuated actin alpha cardiac muscle-1 overexpression after LPS. CONCLUSIONS: LPS administration produces changes in serum proteins associated with lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory response, protein binding/transport, cell adhesion, venous thrombosis, cardiac contractility and blood coagulation. The administration of choline is associated with changes in proteins which can be related with its beneficial effect in this clinical situation.

Deciphering the relative importance of host genetics, environment, and vaccine preparation for the efficacy of BCG has proven difficult in natural populations. We developed a model system that captures the breadth of immunological responses observed in outbred individual mice, which can be used to understand the contribution of host genetics to vaccine efficacy. This system employs a panel of highly diverse inbred mouse strains, consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the \u201CCollaborative Cross\u201D project. Unlike natural populations, the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically identical individuals and the quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination. When analyzed in the aggregate, our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects: the animals displayed a broad range of susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, differed in their immunological responses to infection, and were not durably protected by BCG vaccination. However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable. M. tuberculosis susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive M. tuberculosis clearance. Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination. The efficacy of BCG was genetically separable from susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection. These observations support an important role for host genetic diversity in determining BCG efficacy and provide a new resource to rationally develop more broadly efficacious vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Clare M.; Proulx, Megan K.; Olive, Andrew J.; Laddy, Dominick; Mishra, Bibhuti B.; Moss, Caitlin; Gutierrez, Nuria Martinez; Bellerose, Michelle M.; Barreira-Silva, Palmira; Phuah, Jia Yao; Baker, Richard E.; Behar, Samuel M.; Kornfeld, Hardy; Evans, Thomas G.; Beamer, Gillian; Sassetti, Christopher M.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69d3400351b1b4dbce54ecdec3d4c897dc76b9a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5030360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5030360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzExMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of BCG","BCG efficacy","vaccine efficacy","tuberculosis susceptibility","BCG vaccination","panel","tuberculosis clearance","lack of efficacy","natural populations","outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection","contribution of host genetics","vaccine preparation","breadth of immunological responses","relative importance of host genetics","host genetic diversity","broad range of susceptibility","important role","important respects","nonresponsive lines","distinct response","aggregate analysis","quantification of genotype","genotype level","model system","environment","extreme sensitivity","bacillus Calmette-Guerin","identical individuals","animals","diverse inbred mouse strains","specific effects of interventions","serial evaluation","outbred individual mice","Collaborative Cross","recombinant progeny","founders","structure","new resource","observations","phenotypic differences","project","genotypes","humans","efficacious vaccines","minority"],"language":"en"},

However, the practical uses are limited due to high costs and the risk of anti-drug antibody responses. Attempts to develop anti-TNF-\u03B1 vaccines have generated encouraging data in animal models, however, data from clinical trials have not met expectations. In present study, we designed a TNF-\u03B1 epitope-scaffold immunogen DTNF7 using the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, named DTT as a scaffold. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the grafted TNF-\u03B1 epitope is entirely surface-exposed and presented in a native-like conformation while the rigid helical structure of DTT is minimally perturbed, thereby rendering the immunogen highly stable. Immunization of mice with alum formulated DTNF7 induced humoral responses against native TNF-\u03B1, and the antibody titer was sustained for more than 6 months, which supports a role of the universal CD4 T cell epitopes of DTT in breaking self-immune tolerance. In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, DTNF7-alum vaccination markedly delayed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, and reduced incidence as well as clinical score. DTT is presumed safe as an epitope carrier because a catalytic inactive mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197 has good clinical safety records as an active vaccine component. Taken all together, we show that DTT-based epitope vaccine is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.","publish_time":"2016-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Li; Wang, Jin; Xu, Aizhang; Zhong, Conghao; Lu, Wuguang; Deng, Li; Li, Rongxiu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b11cf879da2036d92fbdbbca07fd8cb7f0416e5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5033357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzExNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["native TNF-\u03B1","grafted TNF-\u03B1 epitope","TNF-\u03B1 epitope-scaffold immunogen DTNF7","anti-TNF-\u03B1 vaccines","DTT-based epitope vaccine","TNF-\u03B1 biological inhibitors","epitope carrier","clinical outcomes","clinical score","clinical trials","induced arthritis","DTNF7-alum vaccination","particular rheumatoid arthritis","rigid helical structure of DTT","good clinical safety records","mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis","universal CD4 T cell epitopes of DTT","treatment of autoimmune diseases","risk of anti-drug antibody responses","transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin","humoral responses","encouraging data","antibody titer","catalytic inactive mutant of diphtheria toxin","active vaccine component","CRM197","promising strategy","prevention","breaking self-immune tolerance","reduced incidence","role","high costs","animal models","onset of collagen","conformation","Molecular dynamics simulation","Immunization of mice","surface","practical uses","expectations","present study","months"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to previously reported H5N6 viruses, viruses with six internal genes derived from the H9N2 or H7N9 viruses were detected in the present study. The increased H5N6 virus-positive rate in the LPMs and the subsequent human infections demonstrated that sustained LPM surveillance for avian influenza viruses provides an early warning for human infections.

While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity. To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation. RESULTS: We validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection. We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03B1) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease. The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF\u03B1 signaling in SARS-CoV infections. Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.

However, since January 2015, the first report of CPV-2c in a puppy has occurred in Taiwan. There is currently limited information about the CPV-2c variant in Taiwan. In the present study, we characterized the previously unidentified CPV-2c variant and investigated the distribution of CPV-2 variants in Taiwan. METHODS: During January 2014 to April 2016, fecal or rectal swab samples from 99 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection in Taiwan were collected. Eighty-eight were identified as being either CPV-2a, \u22122b or -2c variants positive by real-time PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the 88 isolates confirmed CPV-2c as the dominant variant (54.6 %), followed by CPV-2b (26.1 %) and CPV-2a (19.3 %).

With forecasts that future pathogen emergence will be centred in hotspots in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the need to prepare policy frameworks that can combat this threat is urgent. DISCUSSION: Emergence of diseases such as avian influenza and Ebola virus disease, which threatened social disruption, have established the need for intersectoral coordination/collaboration. These events led to the initiation of establishing institutionalised collaborative frameworks in India to adopt a One Health approach to disease prevention and control. However, the gains made in influenza control could not be adapted to other infectious diseases. Intersectoral coordination was briefly carried out, more as a reactive response to threats. The systemic failure to sustain such efforts have therefore, only undermined a coordinated response. The recent draft National Health Policy, 2015, has also failed to establish the need for intersectoral coordination in disease control approaches. Neglecting the need to endorse linkages between human health, animal health and husbandry, agriculture, and environmental sectors, has led to duplicative and weak response systems. The absence of health impact assessment with respect to the development agenda in policies, has cast negative effects on the health and wellbeing of man, animal, and the environment. Lack of attention to building core capacity in these critical sectors has further raised challenges in designing and deploying mitigation strategies. With developing countries like India being home to a major portion of the world\u2019s poorest livestock farmers, the absence of a policy discourse that endorses the One Health approach in development and health policies is a major hurdle in eliminating poverty and poverty-related diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of One Health approaches in health and related sectoral policies is a critical policy requirement for India and other developing countries. The goal should be to not just establish preparedness plans, but also to encourage a policy environment where assessment and mitigation of downstream impacts of different agenda are incorporated.

Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells.

The study uses a quantitative design. Self-reported data were collected from 265 Italian expatriate workers assigned to both Italian and worldwide projects. Structural equation model analyses showed that fear of expatriation mediates the relationship of mental health with fear of economic crisis and with perceived dangerous working conditions. As expected, in addition to fear, worries of expatriation are also related to further fears.

However, few studies have compared different reassortant combinations in pseudoparticle systems, or compared entry kinetics of native viruses and their pseudotyped analogs. Here, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirions displaying distinct influenza virus envelope proteins were tested for fusion activity. We produced VSV pseudotypes containing the prototypical X-31 (H3) HA, either alone or with strain-matched or mismatched N2 NAs. We performed single-particle fusion assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to compare hemifusion kinetics among these pairings. Results illustrate that matching pseudoparticles behaved very similarly to native virus. Pseudoparticles harboring mismatched HA-NA pairings fuse at significantly slower rates than native virus, and NA-lacking pseudoparticles exhibiting the slowest fusion rates. Relative viral membrane HA density of matching pseudoparticles was higher than in mismatching or NA-lacking pseudoparticles. An equivalent trend of HA expression level on cell membranes of HA/NA co-transfected cells was observed and intracellular trafficking of HA was affected by NA co-expression. Overall, we show that specific influenza HA-NA combinations can profoundly affect the critical role played by HA during entry, which may factor into viral fitness and the emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2016-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsu, Hung-Lun; Millet, Jean K.; Costello, Deirdre A.; Whittaker, Gary R.; Daniel, Susan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e1e254fc92ef00d3a23ebaab664289a8a58c88a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5067655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5067655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV","HA/NA","NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NA-lacking pseudoparticles","specific influenza HA-NA combinations","mismatched HA-NA pairings fuse","Virus pseudotyping","cell membranes of HA","intracellular trafficking of HA","NA co-expression","entry of emerging strains of influenza virus","Relative viral membrane HA density of matching pseudoparticles","vesicular stomatitis virus","equivalent trend of HA expression level","distinct influenza virus envelope proteins","NA co-transfected cells","entry kinetics of native viruses","slowest fusion rates","fusion activity","emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses","hemifusion kinetics","single-particle fusion assays","slower rates","viral fitness","VSV pseudotypes","different reassortant combinations","mismatched N2 NAs","total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy","based pseudovirions","safe technique","pseudoparticle systems","mismatching","prototypical X","critical role","pseudotyped analogs","studies","H3","Results"],"language":"en"},

Reports have linked infections to breaches in infection control in the radiography unit (RU). With advances in medical imaging, a higher proportion of patients come into contact with RU staff increasing the need for good hand hygiene compliance. This study aimed to evaluate effectiveness on compliance of an intervention to improve awareness of hand hygiene in the RU of a district hospital. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study design including questionnaires assessing knowledge and attitudes of hand hygiene and direct observation of participants was used to evaluate an educational programme on hand hygiene of the RU of a large district hospital. All healthcare workers (HCW), comprising 76 radiographers, 17 nurses, and nine healthcare assistants (HCA), agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 85 completed the initial and 76 the post-test anonymous questionnaire. The hand hygiene compliance of all 102 HCW was observed over a 3-week period prior to and after the intervention. The 2-month intervention consisted of talks on hand hygiene and benefits of ABHR, provision of visual aids, wall-mounted ABHR dispensers, and personal bottles of ABHR. RESULTS: Before the intervention, overall hand hygiene compliance was low (28.9 %). Post-intervention, compliance with hand hygiene increased to 51.4 %. This improvement was significant for radiographers and HCA. Additionally, knowledge and attitudes improved in particular, understanding that ABHR can largely replace handwashing and there is a need to perform hand hygiene after environmental contact. The increased use of ABHR allowed HCW to feel they had enough time to perform hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention led to increased awareness of hand hygiene opportunities and better acceptance of ABHR use. The reduced time needed to perform hand rubbing and improved access to dispensers resulted in fewer missed opportunities. Although radiographers and other allied HCW make frequent contact with patients, these may be mistakenly construed as irrelevant with respect to healthcare associated infections. Stronger emphasis on hand hygiene compliance of these staff may help reduce infection risk.","publish_time":"2016-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Donoghue, Margaret; Ng, Suk-Hing; Suen, Lorna KP; Boost, Maureen","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92f5ed730f359773e8b3af4bca2d6d6b9cc224c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5070356.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5070356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCA","ABHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attitudes of hand hygiene","overall hand hygiene compliance","good hand hygiene compliance","increased awareness of hand hygiene opportunities","alcohol-based hand rub","increased use of ABHR","benefits of ABHR","nurses\u2019 compliance","educational intervention","RU staff","Post-intervention","month intervention","personal bottles of ABHR","better acceptance of ABHR use","allied HCW","radiographers","wall-mounted ABHR dispensers","need","knowledge","frequent contact","environmental contact","allied health staff","healthcare associated infections","healthcare assistants","healthcare workers","large district hospital","quasi-experimental study design","educational programme","infection control","infection risk","improved access","reduced time","higher proportion of patients","questionnaires","provision of visual aids","direct observation of participants","talks","medical imaging","numerous studies","METHODS","respect","issues","radiography unit","fewer","limited attention","Stronger emphasis","post-test anonymous questionnaire","advances","improvement","effectiveness","BACKGROUND","week period","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","handwashing","Reports"],"language":"en"},

Inflammations are mainly divided into acute and chronic inflammation depending on various inflammatory processes and cellular mechanisms. Recent investigations have clarified that inflammation is a major factor for the progression of various chronic diseases/disorders, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, eye disorders, arthritis, obesity, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Free radical productions from different biological and environmental sources are due to an imbalance of natural antioxidants which further leads to various inflammatory associated diseases. In this review article, we have outlined the inflammatory process and its cellular mechanisms involved in the progression of various chronic modern human diseases. In addition, we have discussed the role of free radicals-induced tissue damage, antioxidant defence, and molecular mechanisms in chronic inflammatory diseases/disorders. The systematic knowledge regarding the role of inflammation and its associated adverse effects can provide a clear understanding in the development of innovative therapeutic targets from natural sources that are intended for suppression of various chronic inflammations associated diseases.","publish_time":"2016-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arulselvan, Palanisamy; Fard, Masoumeh Tangestani; Tan, Woan Sean; Gothai, Sivapragasam; Fakurazi, Sharida; Norhaizan, Mohd Esa; Kumar, S.

Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called \u201Cinvadosomes\u201D. Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dismuke, W.

Sequence and structure conservation provides valuable information to tackle these questions. It is, however, limited by the incomplete sampling of sequence space in natural evolution. Moreover, proteins often have multiple functions, with overlapping sequences that present challenges to accurate annotation of the exact functions of individual residues by conservation-based methods. Using the influenza A virus PB1 protein as an example, we developed a method to systematically identify and annotate functional residues. We used saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput sequencing to measure the replication capacity of single nucleotide mutations across the entire PB1 protein. After predicting protein stability upon mutations, we identified functional PB1 residues that are essential for viral replication. To further annotate the functional residues important to the canonical or noncanonical functions of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp), we performed a homologous-structure analysis with 16 different vRdRp structures. We achieved high sensitivity in annotating the known canonical polymerase functional residues. Moreover, we identified a cluster of noncanonical functional residues located in the loop region of the PB1 \u03B2-ribbon. We further demonstrated that these residues were important for PB1 protein nuclear import through the interaction with Ran-binding protein 5. In summary, we developed a systematic and sensitive method to identify and annotate functional residues that are not restrained by sequence conservation. Importantly, this method is generally applicable to other proteins about which homologous-structure information is available.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Yushen; Wu, Nicholas C.; Jiang, Lin; Zhang, Tianhao; Gong, Danyang; Shu, Sara; Wu, Ting-Ting; Sun, Ren","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e6e95ecc4688bc3345ecfa11f8fee61eccb82bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5090041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5090041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functional PB1 residues","annotation of functional residues","functional residues important","cluster of noncanonical functional residues","known canonical polymerase functional residues","entire PB1 protein","virus PB1 protein","protein sequence analysis","exact functions of individual residues","protein stability","sequence conservation","PB1 protein nuclear import","structure conservation","Ran-binding protein","PB1 \u03B2-ribbon","homologous-structure analysis","homologous-structure information","noncanonical functions of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","multiple functions","viral replication","proteins","sensitive method","incomplete sampling of sequence space","conservation-based methods","accurate annotation","fundamental questions","valuable information","high sensitivity","replication capacity of single nucleotide mutations","high-throughput sequencing","different vRdRp structures","interaction","overlapping sequences","present challenges","loop region","natural evolution","saturation mutagenesis","example","influenza","Identification","summary"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we found two H9N2 viruses with similar genetic background but with different pathogenicity in mice. The A/duck/Nanjing/06/2003 (NJ06) virus was highly pathogenic for mice, with a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of 10(2.83) 50% egg infectious dose (EID(50)), whereas the A/duck/Nanjing/01/1999 (NJ01) virus was low pathogenic for mice, with a MLD(50) of \u003E10(6.81) EID(50). Further studies showed that the NJ06 virus grew faster and reached significantly higher titers than NJ01 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the NJ06 virus induced more severe lung lesions, and higher levels of inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs than NJ01 did. However, only 12 different amino acid residues (HA-K157E, NA-A9T, NA-R435K, PB2-T149P, PB2-K627E, PB1-R187K, PA-L548M, PA-M550L, NP-G127E, NP-P277H, NP-D340N, NS1-D171N) were found between the two viruses, and all these residues except for NA-R435K were located in the known functional regions involved in interaction of viral proteins or between the virus and host factors. Summary, our results suggest that multiple amino acid differences may be responsible for the higher pathogenicity of the NJ06 virus for mice, resulting in lethal infection, enhanced viral replication, severe lung lesions, and excessive inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs. These observations will be helpful for better understanding the pathogenic potential and the corresponding molecular basis of H9N2 viruses that might pose threats to human health in the future.","publish_time":"2016-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qingtao; Liu, Yuzhuo; Yang, Jing; Huang, Xinmei; Han, Kaikai; Zhao, Dongmin; Bi, Keran; Li, Yin","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c26acf9ba8059cbd9caa58acb1a64538cfb7df9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5096341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5096341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID","NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NJ06 virus","mice","H9N2 Avian influenza virus","higher pathogenicity","NJ01","NA-R435K","different pathogenicity","severe lung lesions","higher levels of inflammatory cellular infiltration","cytokine response","NP-P277H","NP-G127E","NP-D340N","NA-A9T","corresponding molecular basis of H9N2 viruses","different amino acid residues","higher titers","pathogenic potential","lungs","mammals","Nanjing","MLD","duck","EID","excessive inflammatory cellular infiltration","mouse lethal dose","PA-L548M","PB2-K627E","PA-M550L","PB2-T149P","viral replication","multiple amino acid differences","corresponding mechanism","lethal infection","interaction of viral proteins","egg infectious dose","HA-K157E","similar genetic background","PB1-R187K","infected humans","results","threats","known functional regions","human health","NS1-D171N","future","host factors","Summary","need","study","studies","observations"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03B1 (HIF-1\u03B1), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1\u03B1 protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1\u03B1 expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8\u00B17.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5\u00B13.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2\u00B12.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6\u00B12.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1\u03B1 expression in the treatment of ONFH.","publish_time":"2016-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Zhen-Hong; Song, Wen-Qi; Zhang, Chang-Qing; Yin, Ji-Min","journal":"Exp Ther Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd92f91038067e7a10aa27d676ce696e1e4d67ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5103711.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5103711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMOG","ONFH","ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transplantation of DMOG","DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group","DMOG enhanced HIF","DMOG-treated ASC group","bone repair capacity of ASCs","\u03B1 expression","normal ASCs transplantation group","necrotic area","bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells","different concentrations of DMOG","\u03B1 protein expression","bone repair capacity of adipose","derived stem cells","treatment of ONFH","untreated group","osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells","enhancing HIF","quantitative analysis","immunohistochemical analysis","Histological analysis","core decompression group","local bone regeneration of osteonecrosis","Micro-CT","rabbit model of ONFH","Western blot analysis","expression of hypoxia inducible factor","control groups","micro-computed tomography","angiogenic","revasculation","femoral head","dose-dependent manner","dimethyloxaloylglycine","weeks","Previous studies","results","days","disease","present study"],"language":"en"},

The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. METHODS: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. RESULTS: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

METHODS: Among consecutive adult patients who had undergone a mPCR within 72 hours following their admission to one intensive care unit (ICU), we retrospectively included those with a final diagnosis of CAP. Four etiology groups were clustered: bacterial, viral, mixed (viral-bacterial) and no etiology. A composite criterion of complicated course (hospital death or mechanical ventilation \u003E 7 days) was used. A subgroup analysis compared patients with bacterial and viral-bacterial CAP matched on the bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Among 174 patients (132 men [76 %], age 63 [53\u201375] years, SAPSII 38 [27;55], median PSI score 106 [78;130]), bacterial, viral, mixed and no etiology groups gathered 46 (26 %), 53 (31 %), 45 (26 %) and 30 (17 %) patients, respectively. Virus-infected patients displayed a high creatine kinase serum level, a low platelet count, and a trend toward more frequent alveolar-interstitial infiltrates. A complicated course was more frequent in the mixed group (31/45, 69 %), as compared to bacterial (18/46, 39 %), viral (15/53, 28 %) and no etiology (12/30, 40 %) groups (p \u003C 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the mixed (viral-bacterial) infection was independently associated with complicated course (reference: bacterial pneumonia; OR, 3.58; CI 95 %, 1.16\u201311; p = 0.03).

In this review we examine whether healthcare facility design is a contributing factor to multifaceted infection control strategies. METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1990 to December 31(st), 2015, with language restriction to English, Spanish, German and French. RESULTS: We identified three studies investigating accessibility of the location of the antiseptic hand rub dispenser. Each of them showed a significant improvement of hand hygiene compliance or agent consumption with the implementation of accessible dispensers near the patient bed. Nine eligible studies evaluated the impact of single-patient rooms on the acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infections in comparison to multi-bedrooms or an open ward design. Six of these studies showed a significant benefit of single-patient bedrooms in reducing the healthcare-associated colonization and infection rate, whereas three studies found that single-patient rooms are neither a protective nor risk factor. In meta-analyses, the overall risk ratio for acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infection was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.74), for healthcare-associated colonization 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) and for bacteremia 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.76), all in favor of patient care in single-patient bedrooms.

The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the pooled estimate at 39.1%. The risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ranged from 44.4 to 100% and from 25.0 to 100%, with pooled estimates at 78.2 and 73.0%, respectively. These risks showed a substantial heterogeneity among the identified studies, and appeared to be the highest in case studies focusing on ICU cases. We identified older age, male sex and underlying medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, renal disease, respiratory disease, heart disease and hypertension, as clinical predictors of death associated with MERS. In ICU case studies, the expected odds ratios (OR) of death among patients with underlying heart disease or renal disease to patients without such comorbidities were 0.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.1, 4.3) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1), respectively, while the ORs were 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.2) and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.9), respectively, in studies with other types of designs. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity for the risk of death and severe manifestations was substantially high among the studies, and varying study designs was one of the underlying reasons for this heterogeneity. A statistical estimation of the risk of MERS death and identification of risk factors must be conducted, particularly considering the study design and potential biases associated with case detection and diagnosis.

METHODS: Based on the fact that postnatal regeneration of alveolar tissue has been attributed to alveolar epithelial cells, we established a hemorrhagic shock and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lung injury model. Using this model, we analyzed the cellular kinetics of lung alveolar epithelial cells. RESULTS: The results showed that alveolar epithelium type 2 cells (AEC2s) are damage resistant during acute lung injury, they might be the main cells involved in lung injury and repair. Then we observed the relationship between the expression of HGF, c-Met following ALI in rat lung and proliferation of AEC2s. The proliferation of AEC2s was inhibited when isolated primary AEC2s were co-cultured with c-Met inhibitor SU11274. Furthermore, the numbers of AEC2s was significantly decreased when ALI rats were administrated with SU11274 in vivo. It provided further evidence that the HGF/c-Met signaling plays a vital role in ALI-induced AEC2s proliferation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serums samples were collected from piglets of age ranging from 1 week to 6 months and the sows associated with the piglets that were reared under organized and unorganized system of management in six different districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The prevalence of RV specific antibodies was detected using a polyclonal antibody-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA). RESULTS: The study revealed that out of 394 serum samples, 255 (64.72%) samples were found to be positive for RV-specific antibody in i-ELISA.

METHOD: Acute lung injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection with LPS (5 mg/kg), followed by immediate intratracheal instillation of siRNA targeting NF-\u03BAB p65 (40 \u03BCg/ml). Animals in each group were sacrificed at 1 h or 8 h after the instillation. Pulmonary histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of NF-\u03BAB and TNF-\u03B1 were measured by qRT-PCR. Expressions of NF-\u03BAB in lung cells and TNF-\u03B1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. RESULTS: LPS administration reduced the rectal temperature and white blood cell counts at 1 h, increased lung wet/dry weight ratios, caused evident lung histopathological injury, and increased the detectable transcript and cytokine levels of TNF-\u03B1 in lung tissue in BALF. siRNA targeting of NF-\u03BAB p65 effectively abrogated the expression of NF-\u03BAB p65 in lung cells and, aside from rectal temperatures, ameliorated all changes induced by LPS.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is known for its cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting its immune regulatory role in allergic lung inflammation. HO-1 has been implicated in affecting DC maturation; however, its role in DC-mediated T-cell differentiation is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that HO-1-expressing bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) displayed tolerogenic phenotypes, including their resistance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maturation, high level expression of IL-10, and low T-cell stimulatory activity.

Also, HO-1-expressing DCs modulated the severity of lung inflammatory responses in two murine models of airway inflammation.

The lack of a reliable mouse model with a fully competent interferon response for DENV infection is a challenge, and here we use an experimental model of DENV infection in the brain of immunocompetent mice. Intracranial injection of DENV-2 into C57BL/6 mice induced body weight loss and neurological symptoms which was associated with a high level of DENV RNA in the brain. Body weight loss and DENV RNA level tended to be greater in SK1(-/-) compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Brain infection with DENV-2 is associated with the induction of interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression including viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7, and CXCL10 without any significant differences between WT and SK1(-/-) mice. The SK2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in the brain were unchanged by DENV infection or the lack of SK1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of a cellular infiltrate in DENV-infected brain with a significant increase in mRNA for CD8 but not CD4 suggesting this infiltrate is likely CD8(\u002B) but not CD4(\u002B) T-lymphocytes. This increase in T-cell infiltration was not affected by the lack of SK1. Overall, DENV-infection in the brain induces IFN and T-cell responses but does not influence the SK/S1P axis.

Our results indicate that FP7 antagonized the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1\u03B2) by monocytes and DCs (IC(50) \u003C 1 \u03BCM) and prevented DC maturation upon TLR4 activation by ultrapure lipopolysaccharide (LPS). FP7 selectively blocked TLR4 stimulation, but not TLR1/2, TLR2/6, or TLR3 activation. TLR4 stimulation of human DCs resulted in increased glycolytic activity that was also antagonized by FP7. FP7 protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced both proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs and acute lung injury (ALI).

DC\u2010SIGN acts both as a pathogen\u2010binding endocytic receptor and as a cell adhesion molecule, while DC\u2010SIGNR has only the pathogen\u2010binding function. In addition to differences in the sugar\u2010binding properties of the carbohydrate\u2010recognition domains in the two receptors, there are sequence differences in the adjacent neck domains, which are coiled\u2010coil tetramerization domains comprised largely of 23\u2010amino acid repeat units. A series of model polypeptides consisting of uniform repeat units have been characterized by gel filtration, differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. The results demonstrate that two features characterize repeat units which form more stable tetramers: a leucine reside in the first position of the heptad pattern of hydrophobic residues that pack on the inside of the coiled coil and an arginine residue on the surface of the coiled coil that forms a salt bridge with a glutamic acid residue in the same polypeptide chain. In DC\u2010SIGNR from all primates, very stable repeat units predominate, so the carbohydrate\u2010recognition domains must be held relatively closely together. In contrast, stable repeat units are found only near the membrane in DC\u2010SIGN.

Development of more effective vaccines against the emerging HP-PRRSV is urgently required. In our previous studies, two formulations of DNA vaccines (pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03BB1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5) based on the HP-PRRSV were constructed and shown to induce enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response induced by these novel formulations in piglets. PcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03BB1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 vaccines induced significantly enhanced GP5-specific antibody and PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibody in pigs compared with the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 parental construct. Though IFN-\u03B3 levels and lymphocyte proliferation responses induced by the two DNA vaccine formulations were comparable to that induced by the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 construct, each of the novel formulations provided efficient protection against challenge with HP-PRRSV.

Our previous study showed that the naked DNA encoding the triple-antigen fusion TFP846 (Rv3615c-Mtb10.4-Rv2660c) induced robust T cellular immune responses accompanying four inoculations against mycobacteria infection. However, a number of compliance issues exist in some areas lacking the appropriate medical infrastructure with multiple administrations. In this study, a novel vesicular stomatitis virus expressing TFP846 (VSV-846) was developed and the immune responses elicited by VSV-846 were evaluated. We observed that intranasal delivery of VSV-846 induced a potent antigen-specific T cell response following a single dose and VSV-846 efficiently controlled bacterial growth to levels ~10-fold lower than that observed in the mock group 6 weeks post-infection in BCG-infected mice. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-846 provided long-term protection against mycobacteria infection compared with those receiving p846 or BCG immunization. Increased memory T cells were also observed in the spleens of VSV-846-vaccinated mice, which could be a potential mechanism associated with long-term protective immune response. These findings supported the use of VSV as an antigen delivery vector with the potential for TB vaccine development.","publish_time":"2017-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ming; Dong, Chunsheng; Xiong, Sidong","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a246d3621609eba5e7fb36c483280aa9cacd166.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5293745.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5293745/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of VSV","spleens of VSV","intranasal delivery of VSV","mycobacteria infection","BCG-infected mice","long-term protective immune response","antigen delivery vector","robust T cellular immune responses","long-term protection","BCG immunization","vaccinated mice","potent antigen-specific T cell response","triple-antigen fusion TFP846","weeks post-infection","TB vaccine development","long-term lasting immunity","potential mechanism","available vaccine","Increased memory T cells","previous study","Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin","Rv2660c","inoculations","novel vesicular stomatitis virus","naked DNA","Rv3615c-Mtb10","single dose","areas","appropriate medical infrastructure","doses","mock group","serious health problem","multiple administrations","levels","bacterial growth","number of compliance issues","urgent need","vaccination protocols","Tuberculosis","findings"],"language":"en"},

Toll-like receptors in alveolar macrophages (AM\u03A6) recognize the molecular constituents of pathogens and activate the host\u2019s innate immune responses. Numerous studies have documented the importance of TLR-TLR cross talk, but few studies have specifically addressed the relationship between TLR4 and TLR3. We explored a novel mechanism of TLR3 up-regulation that is induced by LPS-TLR4 signaling in a dose- and time-dependent manner in AM\u03A6 from C57BL/6 mice, while the LPS-induced TLR3 expression was significantly reduced in TLR4(\u2212/\u2212) and Myd88(\u2212/\u2212) mice and following pretreatment with a NF-\u03BAB inhibitor. The enhanced TLR3 up-regulation in AM\u03A6 augmented the expression of cytokines and chemokines in response to sequential challenges with LPS and Poly I:C, a TLR3 ligand, which was physiologically associated with amplified AM\u03A6-induced PMN migration into lung alveoli. Our study demonstrates that the synergistic effect between TLR4 and TLR3 in macrophages is an important determinant in acute lung injury and, more importantly, that TLR3 up-regulation is dependent on TLR4-MyD88-NF-\u03BAB signaling. These results raise the possibility that bacterial infections can induce sensitivity to viral infections, which may have important implications for the therapeutic manipulation of the innate immune system.","publish_time":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Xibing; Jin, Shuqing; Tong, Yao; Jiang, Xi; Chen, Zhixia; Mei, Shuya; Zhang, Liming; Billiar, Timothy R.; Li, Quan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6f1886154af3ff272e59a9a82b310373330a9ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5309825.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5309825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LPS-TLR4","enhanced TLR3","TLR3 ligand","LPS-induced TLR3 expression","TLR4-MyD88","regulation","novel mechanism of TLR3","Acute lung injury","amplified AM\u03A6-induced PMN migration","lung alveoli","mice","innate immune system","NF-\u03BAB inhibitor","important determinant","bacterial infections","viral infections","importance of TLR","important implications","alveolar macrophages","expression of cytokines","host\u2019s innate immune responses","Numerous studies","life-threatening inflammatory response","TLR cross talk","time-dependent manner","therapeutic manipulation","sequential challenges","sensitivity","chemokines","Poly","dose","synergistic effect","molecular constituents of pathogens","possibility","severe infection","receptors","pretreatment","C57BL","results","Toll","relationship","study"],"language":"en"},

Unwanted effects of aspirin (aspirin intolerance) are also observed in patients with food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, a type I allergy disease, and aspirin-induced urticaria (AIU). However the target and the mechanism of the aspirin intolerance are still unknown. There is no animal or cellular model of AERD, because its pathophysiological mechanism is still unknown, but it is thought that inhibition of cyclooxygenase by causative agents leads to an increase of free arachidonic acid, which is metabolized into cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) that provoke airway smooth muscle constriction and asthma symptoms. As the bed-to-bench approach, to confirm the clinical discussion in experimental cellular models, we have tried to develop a cellular model of AERD using activated RBL-2H3 cells, a rat mast cell like cell line. Indomethacin (another NSAID and also causes AERD), enhances in vitro cysLTs production by RBL-2H3 cells, while there is no induction of cysLTs production in the absence of inflammatory activation. Since this suggests that all inflammatory cells with activation of prostaglandin and cysLT metabolism should respond to NSAIDs, and then I have concluded that aspirin intolerance should be separated from subsequent bronchoconstriction. Evidence about the cellular mechanisms of NSAIDs may be employed for development of in vitro AERD models as the approach from bench-to-bed.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamashita, Masamichi","journal":"Curr Drug Targets","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a40363fa5527e9b6dbf6930b247a4608027e7983.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5345322.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AERD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aspirin intolerance","cellular model of AERD","AERD models","aspirin-induced urticaria","Unwanted effects of aspirin","inflammatory cells","experimental cellular models","cellular mechanisms of NSAIDs","activated RBL-2H3 cells","induction of cysLTs production","asthma symptoms","bench approach","bed","absence of inflammatory activation","allergy disease","cell line","activation of prostaglandin","respiratory disease","pathophysiological mechanism","rat mast cell","food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis","airway smooth muscle constriction","type","oldest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","clinical discussion","causative agents","cysLT metabolism","increase of free arachidonic acid","patients","inhibition of cyclooxygenase","cysteinyl leukotrienes","Evidence","AIU","development of","animal","subsequent bronchoconstriction","target","Indomethacin"],"language":"en"},

Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers.

As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing global interest in the role of serological testing for population monitoring and to inform public policy. However, limitations in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the validity of seroprevalence estimates and their utility in decision-making. There is now a critical window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We aimed to synthesize the results of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and provide recommendations to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future serosurveillance efforts. Methods. This was a rapid systematic review of cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting seroprevalence outcomes for SARS-CoV 2. We included completed, ongoing, and proposed serosurveys. The search included electronic databases (PubMed, MedRXIV, BioRXIV, and WHO ICTPR); five medical journals (NEJM, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine); reports by governments, NGOs, and health systems; and media reports (Google News) from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics and critically appraised prevalence estimates using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Results. Seventy records met inclusion criteria, describing 73 studies. Of these, 23 reported prevalence estimates: eight preprints, 14 news articles, and one government report. These studies had a total sample size of 35,784 and reported 42 prevalence estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 59.3%. No estimates were found to have a low risk of bias (43% high risk, 21% moderate risk, 36% unclear). Fifty records reported characteristics of ongoing or proposed serosurveys. Overall, twenty countries have completed, ongoing, or proposed serosurveys. Discussion. Study design, quality, and prevalence estimates of early SARS-CoV2 serosurveys are heterogeneous, suggesting that the urgency to examine seroprevalence may have compromised methodological rigour. Based on the limitations of included studies, future serosurvey investigators and stakeholders should ensure that: i) serological tests used undergo high-quality independent evaluations that include cross-reactivity; ii) all reports of serosurvey results, including media, describe the test used, sample size, and sampling method; and iii) initiatives are coordinated to prevent test fatigue, minimize redundant efforts, and encourage better study methodology.

The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n=1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced even higher levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. We conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms during lockdown. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e. state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. To prevent stress, authorities should explain containment measures well, highlight positive aspects of the crisis, address worries, and facilitate support.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wissmath, B.; Mast, F.

In this short contribution, we discuss the significance of global wildlife trade considering the full diversity of organisms for which data are available in the IUCN database.

Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries and/or actual advantage in virus transmissibility could explain the high frequency reached by some genomic variants during the course of the outbreak. Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A \u2192 G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D \u2192 G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein. We conclude that the different conformation of the S1/S2 proteolytic site is at the basis of the higher transmission rate of this invasive SARS-CoV-2 variant, and provide structural information to guide the design of selective and efficient drugs.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trucchi, Emiliano; Gratton, Paolo; Mafessoni, Fabrizio; Motta, Stefano; Cicconardi, Francesco; Bertorelle, Giorgio; D\u2019Annessa, Ilda; Di Marino, Daniele","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3f3a845e9cd3c054778069e2eb8c5486a16d1a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.095620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spike protein position","spike S1","genomic position","genomic variants","represented spike protein variant","G nucleotide change","G clade","countries","selective advantage","G amino acid change","S2 proteolytic site","invasive SARS-CoV","S2 furin","design of selective","actual advantage","structural information","long-range effect","non-random process","specific structural modification","higher transmission rate","short range effect","cross-connection","basis","conformational plasticity","receptor-binding domain","population genetics","functional domains","virus transmissibility","high frequency","stochastic effects","significant demographic expansion","established propagules of infections","suite of statistical","theoretical approaches","internal motion","enhanced pathogenicity","different conformation","spread","G614","efficient drugs","Wuhan","China","course","outbreak","Stochasticity","epidemics","months","study"],"language":"en"},

Summary This work examines the impact of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic and the organizational recommendations that have been issued since March 16 on tumor boards (TB) activity. The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians\u2019 attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3,943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72070 files (including 30127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians\u2019 number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grosclaude, Pascale; Azria, David; Guimbaud, Rosine; Thibault, S\u00E9verine; Daubisse, Laetitia; Cartron, Guillaume; Renaudie, Marie-Jos\u00E9; Dalbies, Pierre-Adrien; Delord, Jean-Pierre; Bauvin, Eric","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/003fa21e67f7d722d463135f354d23db0229de7e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0007455120302332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007455120302332?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":["MTM"],"locations":["m\u00E9diterran\u00E9enne","Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["the impact","The physicians","the region","the SARS","the pandemic","The pre","in the number","the participation to the MTM","the average number","followed the recommendations","The study covered","in the following month","in the third period","The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part","the organizational recommendations that","the decrease in average MTM activity","the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in","containment activity was compared to the activity","warranted to estimate the real impact","attendance were the evaluation criteria","The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January","In addition","impact r\u00E9el","nombre de r\u00E9unions tenues","nombre de dossiers examin\u00E9s","nombre moyen de dossiers examin\u00E9s","nombre de m\u00E9decins participant","tumor boards","shows that its impact","nombre moyen de m\u00E9decins pr\u00E9sents","first submissions","fiches RCP extraites","confinement","activit\u00E9","number who attended MTM also decreased","This first study","meetings held","There was","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie de SARS","premi\u00E8res pr\u00E9sentations","potential delay in patient management","TB that held","files reviewed per meeting including first presentations","files examined decreased","meetings after March","moderate decrease","prise","premi\u00E8res soumissions","recommandations","r\u00E9gion","multidisciplinary team meetings","CoV2 epidemic","optimizing quorum","optimisation du quorum","charge des patients","celles des p\u00E9riodes","p\u00E9riodes \u00E9quivalentes","large region but little affected","issued since March","Summary This work","charge globale oncologique","covering","suggests","particularly","quantitative works","even more","carcinologic outcomes","Dossier Communicant","Canc\u00E9rologie","diminution","However","Complementary qualitative","diagnostic","retard","travaux qualitatifs","\u00E9chelle","partie m\u00E9diterran\u00E9enne","crit\u00E8res de jugement","Occitanie","travail","premi\u00E8re \u00E9tude","April","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","mois suivant","troisi\u00E8me quinzaine","baisse"],"language":"fr"},

We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. 21.3% recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia and 87.2% of recipients had therapeutic tacrolimus concentration (5-12ng/ml). 5 and 6 recipients had liver and kidney insufficiency respectively.

Turkey took its place among these countries on 7th of May, 2020 by reporting SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR levels at the inlet of seven (7) major municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Istanbul [Alpaslan Kocamemi et al., 2020], which is a metropole with 15.5 million inhabitants and a very high population density (2987 persons/km2) and having about 65 % of Covid-19 cases in Turkey. Sludges that are produced in WWTPs should be expected to contain SARS-CoV-2 virus as well. There has not yet been any study for the fate of SAR-CoV-2 in sludges generated from WWTPs. Knowledge about the existing of SARS-CoV-2 in sludge may be useful for handling the sludge during its dewatering, stabilizing and disposal processes. This information will also be valuable in case of sludges that are used as soil conditioners in agriculture or sent to landfill disposal. In wastewater treatment plants, generally two different types of sludges are generated; primary sludge (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS). PS forms during the settling of wastewater by gravity in the primary settling tanks. Little decomposition occurs during primary sludge formation. Since most of the inorganic part of the wastewater is removed in the earlier grit removal process, the PS consists of mainly organic material that settles. The PS is about 1-2 % solids by weight. In the biological treatment part of the WWTPs, the biomass that forms in the anaerobic, anoxic and oxic zones of the process is settled in final clarifiers by gravity and returned to the beginning of the biological process so that it is not washed off. The waste activated sludge (WAS) is the excess part of the biomass that grows in this secondary treatment process. It has to be removed from the process not to increase the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (bacteria concentration) in the secondary process more than a fixed value. The WAS is about 0.6 - 0.9 % solids by weight. This work aims to find whether SARS-CoV-19 is present in the PS and WAS before it is dewatered and sent to anaerobic or aerobic digester processes or to thermal drying operations. For this purpose, on the 7th of May 2020, two (2) PS samples were collected from Ambarl and Tuzla WWTPs, seven (7) WAS samples were collected from Terkos, Ambarl, Atakoy I \u0026 II, Pasakoy II, Buyukcekmece and Tuzla I WWTPs. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [Wu et al., 2020] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. [Alpaslan Kocamemi et al., 2020].

We wanted to compare specimen types and collection methods to explore if a simpler to collect specimen type could expand access to testing. Methods: We recruited individuals recently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through a testing program (drive-through). In homes of participants, we assessed the performance of self-collected oral fluid swab specimens with and without clinician supervision, clinician-supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (nasal) swab specimens, and clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We tested specimens with a validated reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and measured cycle threshold values. Symptom status and date of onset of symptoms was also recorded for each participant. Results: We recruited 45 participants. The median age of study participant was 42 years old (Interquartile range, 31 to 52 years). Of the participants, 29 had at least one specimen test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 21 (73%) of 29 reported active symptoms. By specimen type and home-based collection method, clinician-supervised self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 26 (90%) of 29 infected individuals, clinician-supervised self-collected nasal swab specimens detected 23 (85%) of 27, clinician-collected posterior nasopharyngeal swab specimens detected 23 (79%) of 29, and unmonitored self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 19 (66%) of 29. Despite nasopharyngeal swabs being considered the gold standard, 4 participants tested negative by clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab and positive by the 3 other specimen types. Additionally, false negative results by each sample type were seen to generally not overlap. Conclusions: Supervised self-collected oral fluid and nasal swab specimens performed similarly to, if not better than clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sample type captured all SARS-CoV-2 infections, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the distribution of viral load in different parts of the respiratory tract between individuals. Supervised self-collection performed comparably to clinician collection and would allow for rapid expansion of testing capacity in the United States by reducing the need for trained healthcare workers, reducing exposure of healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of PPE (personal protective equipment) being used for testing during a critical shortage.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kojima, Noah; Turner, Fred; Slepnev, Vlad; Bacelar, Agatha; Deming, Laura; Kodeboyina, Siri; Klausner, Jeffrey D","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["self-collected nasal swab specimens","performance of self-collected oral fluid swab specimens","unmonitored self-collected oral fluid swab specimens","clinician collection","posterior nasopharyngeal swab specimens","Supervised self-collected oral fluid","SARS-CoV","self-collection","clinician supervision","self-collected mid-turbinate","detection of SARS","specimen types","sample type","collection methods","nasopharyngeal swabs","specimen test positive","testing program","homes of participants","home-based collection method","infected individuals","rapid expansion of testing capacity","trained healthcare workers","exposure of healthcare workers","false negative results","respiratory tract","years old","active symptoms","median age of study participant","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","validated reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay","different parts","distribution of viral load","potential heterogeneity","United States","need","gold standard","Conclusions","Interquartile range","date of onset","measured cycle threshold values","infections","personal protective equipment","Symptom status","PPE","drive","access","pandemic","critical shortage","Background","Covid"],"language":"en"},

An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-of-outbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Djaafara, Bimandra A; Imai, Natsuko; Hamblion, Esther; Impouma, Benido; Donnelly, Christl A; Cori, Anne","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/541e7d329fa466fe7b961263666386dddec75894.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola Virus Disease"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak declaration","preliminary end","official end","probability of cases","outbreak criteria","detected case","symptom onset day","days of enhanced surveillance period","day enhanced surveillance","EVD","probability of flare ups","risk of post-declaration flare-ups","infectious disease outbreaks","potential flare-ups of cases","important step","infectious diseases","simulated Ebola Virus Disease","reporting rate","instantaneous reproduction number","delay","recovery","data","death","criterion","future","outcome","results","objective estimation","simulation-based model","scenarios","shift","quantitative framework"],"language":"en"},

However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jing, Qin; You, Chong; Lin, Qiushi; Hu, Taojun; Yu, Shicheng; Zhou, Xiao-Hua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d3b3f4ab80a61c45f82c61c6c756cfc6ddf4bf2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["estimated incubation distribution","incubation period of COVID","estimated median of incubation period","days","estimated distribution of forward time","long incubation periods","CI","forward follow-up study","forward recurrence time","time of departure","available forward time data","observations of selected forward times","symptoms","percentile","accurate method","collected data","renewal process","recent published studies","symptom onset","asymptomatic individuals","duration","epidemiology","current outbreak of coronavirus disease","recall bias","accuracy of estimation","important clinical characteristics","mild assumptions","Different estimates","Background","proportion","confidence interval","Findings","countries","global crisis","Wuhan","infection","patients","results","Interpretation","parameters","Methods","mean","limitations"],"language":"en"},

Five machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained on a random sample of 70% of the patients, and performance was tested on new unseen data (30%). The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16).

Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public\u0027s attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public\u0027s attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Methods: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2mm, 2.75mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. Results: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol is unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume towards the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67{\u002B/-}8 seconds in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2mm tip towards the corneal wound. Conclusions: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of a clear cornea phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Darcy, K.; Elhaddad, O.; Achiron, A.; Keller, J.; Leadbetter, D.; Tole, D.; Liyanage, S.

The seamless integration of these processes into a fully automated microscale format has led to the development of rapid, user-friendly sample-to-answer assay systems. The application of these systems for human identity testing allows for DNA profiles to be generated in a field-forward environment where they can be used to generate investigative leads in crimes or other actionable intelligence. When used for infectious disease diagnostics, the sensitivity and specificity of these assay systems meets or exceeds that of more conventional strategies for the detection of respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and sexually transmitted pathogens. The anticipated medical benefits of this technology include shorter hospital stays, the elimination of unnecessary or ineffectual treatment, improved patient outcomes, and an overall quantifiable reduction in healthcare costs.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danielson, P.

In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. We found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment was tolerated to at least 5 cycles by masks. Most notably, standard autoclave treatment was associated with no loss of structural or functional integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles for the 3 pleated mask models. The molded N95 mask however tolerated only 1 cycle.

The present manuscript proposes a heuristic global algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic trend. Methods The proposed method utilizes a Gaussian-function-based algorithm for estimating how the temporal evolution of the pandemic develops by predicting daily COVID-19 deaths, for up to 10 days, from the day the prediction is made. This dataset, the number of daily deaths in each country or region, encapsulates information about (a) the quality of the health system of each country or region, (b) the age profile of the country s or region s population, and (c) environmental and other conditions. Findings The validity of the proposed heuristic global algorithm has been tested in the case of China (at different temporal stages of the pandemic), a country where the disease trend seems to have run its course. It has been applied to ten countries/states/cities, namely California, Germany, China, Greece, Iran, Lombardia/Italy, New York, Sweden, United Kingdom and USA, for each one of which predictions have been obtained. The method has also been applied to the United States as a whole, as well as to the states of New York and California, in order to investigate how the pandemic is developing in different parts of the same country. Interpretation Based on the predicted findings, the proposed algorithm seems to offer a robust and reliable method for revealing the SARS-CoV-2 temporal dynamics and disease trend, as such, can be a useful tool for the relevant authorities.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asteris, Panagiotis G.; Douvika, Maria; Karamani, Christina; Skentou, Athanasia; Daras, Tryfon; Cavaleri, Liborio; Armaghani, Danial Jahed; Chlichlia, Katerina; Zaoutis, Theoklis E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93fed3054f2960f7f8ff0b846542fa34a6ed8f4a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20068445v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany","China","Greece","Iran","United States","New York"],"keyphrases":["proposed algorithm","country s","pandemic trend","based algorithm","proposed method","proposed heuristic global algorithm","disease trend","United States","states of New York","region s population","temporal dynamics","California","different temporal stages","temporal evolution","daily COVID","reliable method","course","number of daily deaths","useful tools","case of China","United Kingdom","predicted findings","different parts","Greece","Iran","Italy","Sweden","Lombardia","Gaussian-function","Germany","SARS-CoV","age profile","validity","Background Mathematical models","cities","health system","present manuscript","order","quality","days","relevant authorities","USA","dataset","Methods","information","conditions","Interpretation","countries","epidemic","predictions"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the evidence available at LitCovid, until March 23th, 2020, and selected articles that reported the prevalence of socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms and co-morbidities in adults with COVID-19. Results: In total, 1 572 publications were published on LitCovid. We have included 56 articles in our analysis, with 89% conducted in China, and 75% contained inpatients. Three studies were conducted in North America and one in Europe. Participants age ranged from 28 to 70 years, with balanced gender distribution. Proportion of asymptomatic cases were from 2 to 79%. The most common reported symptoms were fever [4-99%], cough [4-92%], dyspnoea/shortness of breath [1-90%], fatigue 4-89%], myalgia [3-65%], and pharyngalgia [2-61%], while regarding co-morbidities we found cardiovascular disease [1-40%], hypertension [0-40%] and cerebrovascular disease [1-40%].

Mitigating interventions may change the exponent during the rising phase and a plateau can replace a peak. With interventions comes the risk that relaxation causes a second-wave. In the UK Covid-19 epidemic, infections cannot be counted, but their influence is seen in the curve of the mortality data. This work simulated social distancing and the lockdown in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to explore strategies for relaxation. Methods Cumulative mortality data was transposed 20 days earlier to identify three doubling periods separated by the 17th March - social distancing, and 23rd March - lockdown. A set of stochastic processes simulated viral transmission between interacting individuals using Covid-19 incubation and illness durations. Social distancing and restrictions on interactions were imposed and later relaxed. Principal Findings Daily mortality data, consistent with that seen in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to 24th April 2020 was simulated. This output predicts that under a lockdown maintained till early July 2020, UK deaths will exceed 31,000, but leave a large susceptible population and a requirement for vaccination or quarantine. An earlier staged relaxation carries a risk of a second-wave. The model allows exploration of strategies for lifting the lockdown. Interpretation Social distancing and the lockdown have had an impressive impact on the UK Covid-19 epidemic and saved lives, caution is now needed in planning its relaxation.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lander, A.

These tests differ between one another in several ways. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, and assessed their real-world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals. We included independent studies that specified the antigen used for antibody detection and used quantitative methods. We identified nine independent studies, of which six were based on commercial ELISA or CMIA/CLIA assays, and three on in-house tests. Test sensitivity ranged from 68% to 93% for IgM, from 65% to 100% for IgG, and from 83% to 98% for total antibodies. Random-effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of 82% (95%CI 75-88%) for IgM, and 85% for both IgG (95%CI 73-93%) and total antibodies (95%CI 74-94%). Specificity was very high for most tests, and its pooled estimate was 98% (95%CI 92-100%) for IgM and 99% (95%CI 98-100%) for both IgG and total antibodies. The heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity across tests was generally high (I2[\u2264]50%). In populations with a low prevalence ([\u2264]5%) of seroconverted individuals, the positive predictive value would be [\u2264]88% for most assays, except those reporting perfect specificity.

There is no cure for COVID-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARS-CoV-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses.

Population density is an important driver of national incidence rates; however peak incidences in rural regions may lag national figures by several weeks. We aimed to forecast the impact of relaxed social distancing rules on rural North Wales. Methods: Daily data on the deaths of people with a positive test for Covid-19 were obtained from Public Health Wales and the UK Government. Sigmoidal growth functions were fitted by non-linear least squares and model averaging used to extrapolate mortality over time. The dates of peak mortality incidences for North Wales, Wales and the UK; and the percentage predicted maximum mortality (as of 7th May 2020) were estimated. Results: The peak daily death rates in Wales and the UK were estimated to have occurred on the 14/04/2020 and 15/04/2020, respectively. For North Wales, this occurred on the 07/05/2020, corresponding to the date of analysis. The number of deaths reported in North Wales represents 31% of the predicted total cumulative number, compared with 71% and 60% for Wales and the UK, respectively. Conclusion: Policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas -principally rural in nature- where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas. This is particularly difficult to manage across jurisdictions, such as between England and Wales, and in popular holiday destinations.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hughes, R.

To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested.

We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy.

In a four-week period during the initial spread of COVID-19 at a 300 bed community hospital in western Massachusetts, 23 patients who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA required treatment in either the intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate/step-down unit (SDU). All patients were treated with standard DVT prophylaxis from the time of admission, except for two patients who were on full anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation. Of the 23 patients, 7 (30%) were diagnosed with acute, clinically significant, pulmonary embolism (PE). Four of the 7 manifested evidence of acute cor pulmonale, one of whom succumbed as a direct consequence of a massive PE. Other markers were reviewed in the 7 patients to identify trends that could allow for early suspicion of PE in COVID-19 patients.

Identifying performance indicators that measure aspects of patient care processes related to preventable harms can present opportunities to improve health systems. In this paper, we present our protocol for a scoping review to identify performance indicators for obstetric safety. We aim to identify a comprehensive list of obstetric safety indicators which may help reduce the number of preventable patient harms, to summarize the data and to synthesize the results. Methods and analysis: We will use the methodological framework described by Arksey and O Malley and further expanded by Levac. We will search multiple electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library as well as websites from professional bodies and other organisations, using an iterative search strategy. We will include indicators that relate to preventable harms in the process of obstetric care. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of search results to determine eligibility for inclusion. For records where eligibility is not clear, the reviewers will screen the full text version. If reviewers decisions regarding eligibility differ, a third reviewer will review the full text record. Two reviewers will independently extract data from records that meet our inclusion criteria using a standardized data collection form. We will narratively describe quantitative data, such as the frequency with which indicators are identified, and conduct a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We will compile a comprehensive list of patient safety indicators identified during our scoping review and organise them according to concepts that best suit the data such as the Donabedian model or the Hospital Harm Framework. We will discuss the implications of the indicators for future research, clinical practice and policy making. We will report the conduct of the review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA ScR) Checklist. Ethics and Dissemination: The sources of information included in this scoping review will be available to the public. Therefore, ethical review for this research is not warranted. We will disseminate our research results using multiple modes of delivery such as a peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and stakeholder communications.

In order to understand its pathogenicity, antigenic potential and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 translated open reading frames (ORF)s in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suit of ribosome profiling techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral ORFs and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. Finally, we detected a prominent initiation at a CUG codon located in the 5\u2019UTR. Although this codon is shared by all SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, the initiation was specific to the genomic RNA, indicating that the genomic RNA harbors unique features that may affect ribosome engagement. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome, providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic efforts.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finkel, Yaara; Mizrahi, Orel; Nachshon, Aharon; Weingarten-Gabbay, Shira; Yahalom-Ronen, Yfat; Tamir, Hadas; Achdout, Hagit; Melamed, Sharon; Weiss, Shay; Israely, Tomer; Paran, Nir; Schwartz, Michal; Stern-Ginossar, Noam","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1639e3860d1603dd8393199d672d355fb39c1b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082909","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CUG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","frame ORFs","coding capacity of SARS","existing ORFs","frame internal ORFs","specific collection of SARS","novel unannotated viral ORFs","expression of canonical viral ORFs","coding capacity map","coding regions","coronaviruses","high-resolution map","diagnostic efforts","prominent initiation","novel polypeptides","ribosome engagement","CUG codon","expressed proteins","genomic RNA harbors unique features","variety of accessory proteins","suit of ribosome profiling techniques","open reading frames","basis of future functional studies","antigenic potential","genome","transcripts","therapeutic tools","computational predictions","coronavirus responsible","COVID","pathogenicity","open-ended manner","repertoire","protein array","homology","truncated products","rich resource","order","pandemic","work","UTR"],"language":"en"},

The PVP-I gel forming nasal spray (IVIEW-1503) and PVP-I gel forming ophthalmic eye drop (IVIEW-1201) rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting the viral infection of VERO76 cells. No toxicity was observed for the PVP-I formulations. Significant inactivation was noted with preincubation of the virus with these PVP-I formulations at the lowest concentrations tested. It has been demonstrated that both PVP-I formulations can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus efficiently in both a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner. These results suggest IVIEW-1503 and IVIEW-1201 could be potential agents to reduce or prevent the transmission of the virus through the nasal cavity and the eye, respectively.

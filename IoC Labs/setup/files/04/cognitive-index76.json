The outcome of 39 pregnancies after artificial insemination or natural service during a 4 month period of risk for contracting BVDV was nine abortions, one mummified foetus, one still-birth, three calves that died within 1 week of age, 12 calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (11 males and one female) and 13 non-PI calves. Retrospective studies showed that only two of the 13 dams (15.4%) of non-PI calves had been inseminated once, which is a significantly (P \u003C 0.001) lower rate than for 192 other gestations (66.7%) during the 3 year period. The gestational duration of multiparous cows (but not of heifers) was longer (P \u003C 0.01) for five cows with PI calves (mean \u00B1 SD 287.6 \u00B1 9.5 days) than for 53 other gestations in 35 cows (280.6 \u00B1 3.8 days). Five of the 12 dams of the PI calves had not expelled the foetal membranes within 2 days after calving, which is a higher (P \u003C 0.001) incidence than the seven cases of retained placenta observed after 198 other calvings. Furthermore, there was a 4.4-fold higher risk (P \u003C 0.01) of treatment for enteritis and/or pneumonia in calves and a 6.0-fold higher risk of calf mortality associated with the introduction of BVDV. The mean heart girth of the PI calves was less (P \u003C 0.05) than that of non-PI calves, at both 80 and 180 days of age.","publish_time":"2003-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larsson, B.; Niskanen, R.; Alenius, S.","journal":"Anim Reprod Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-PI calves","days of age","contracting BVDV","introduction of BVDV","year period","month period of risk","higher risk of calf mortality","gestations","dams","gestational duration of multiparous cows","bovine virus diarrhoea virus","natural service","week of age","consequences of natural infections","mean heart girth","pregnancies","artificial insemination","abortions","female","foetal membranes","SD","mummified foetus","dairy herd","outcome","treatment","enteritis","pneumonia","birth","lower rate","incidence","heifers","males","placenta","cases","Retrospective studies","calvings"],"language":"en"},

Forty-three (72 per cent) gastroenteritis patients had rotavirus detectable in stools by electron microscopy or immune electron microscopy. Of the remainder, 17 patients were regarded as having non-rotavirus diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Esch. coli. was isolated from seven patients of whom six yielded stable toxin producers (ST\u002B), four labile toxin producers (LT\u002B) and two dual toxigenic strains (ST\u002B/LT\u002B). All ST\u002B isolates appeared to be of low enterotoxigenicity as indicated by low gut weight/carcass weight ratios in the infant mouse assay. Rotavirus was the commonest aetiological agent (72 per cent), bacterial pathogens (alone) accounted for only five per cent and no enteric pathogens were found in 15 per cent of cases.

Therefore, the HA protein is regarded as a suitable target for the development of influenza virus detection devices. In this study, we isolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers binding to the HA1 subunit of subtype H1 (H1-HA1), but not to the HA1 subunit of subtype H5 (H5-HA1), using a counter-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (counter-SELEX) procedure. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance studies showed that the selected aptamers bind tightly to H1-HA1 with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the aptamers were binding to H1-HA1 in a concentration-dependent manner, yet were not binding to H5-HA1. Interestingly, the selected aptamers contained G-rich sequences in the central random nucleotides region. Further biophysical analysis showed that the G-rich sequences formed a G-quadruplex structure, which is a distinctive structure compared to the starting ssDNA library. Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that the aptamers did not bind to the receptor-binding site of H1-HA1. These results indicate that the selected aptamers that distinguish H1-HA1 from H5-HA1 can be developed as unique probes for the detection of the H1 subtype of influenza virus.","publish_time":"2015-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Hye-Min; Lee, Jin-Moo; Yim, Sanggyu; Jeong, Yong-Joo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e35886a4c45a6f26a17e68185b4172fb32ceb452.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4406500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4406500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1-HA1","H5-HA1","HA1 subunit of subtype H1","HA1 subunit of subtype H5","selected aptamers","H1 subtype of influenza virus","binding of influenza virus","receptor-binding site of H1","G-rich sequences","development of influenza virus detection devices","G-quadruplex structure","HA protein","biophysical analysis","Surface protein hemagglutinin","Western blot analysis","flow cytometry analysis","distinctive structure","counter-SELEX","host cells","starting ssDNA library","surface plasmon resonance studies","counter-systematic evolution of ligands","exponential enrichment","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","cell receptors","central random nucleotides region","entry","suitable target","dissociation constants","sialic acid","single-stranded DNA","nanomolar range","unique probes","concentration-dependent manner","procedure","study","results"],"language":"en"},

The current study was designed to rigorously measure the reliability of a phylogenetic marker included into segment B. This marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies, incorporating this segment of the viral genome, to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus (vvIBDV) strains worldwide. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequences of the segment B gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank Database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. A phylogenetic marker named B-marker was assessed by different phylogenetic principles such as saturation of substitution, phylogenetic noise and high consistency. This last parameter is based on the ability of B-marker to reconstruct the same topology as the complete segment B of the viral genome. From the results obtained from B-marker, demographic history for both main lineages of IBDV regarding segment B was performed by Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis for both segments of IBDV genome was also performed, revealing the presence of a natural reassortant strain with segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains within Cuban IBDV population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of vvIBDV strains, describing molecular epidemiology of IBDV using the state-of-the-art methodology concerning phylogenetic reconstruction. This study also revealed the presence of a novel natural reassorted strain as possible manifest of change in the genetic structure and stability of the vvIBDV strains. Therefore, it highlights the need to obtain information about both genome segments of IBDV for molecular epidemiology studies.","publish_time":"2015-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfonso-Morales, Abdulahi; Rios, Liliam; Mart\u00EDnez-P\u00E9rez, Orlando; Dolz, Roser; Valle, Rosa; Perera, Carmen L.; Bertran, Kateri; Fr\u00EDas, Maria T.; Ganges, Llilianne; D\u00EDaz de Arce, Heidy; Maj\u00F3, Nat\u00E0lia; N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Jos\u00E9 I.; P\u00E9rez, Lester J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/471d79fab1a95464be76c77dce4a2e263ca8b443.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4422720.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422720/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

The protein microarray was used to test Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), AIV positive and negative sera. The results indicated that the protein microarray could hybridize specifically with antibodies against AIV with strong signals and without cross-hybridization. Moreover, 76 field serum samples were detected by microarray, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). The positive rate was 92.1% (70/76), 93.4% (71/76) and 89.4% (68/76) by protein microarray, ELISA and HI test, respectively.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014 influenza season but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias. In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from observation and evaluate forecast accuracy. Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of the flu season, our forecasting method produced 50% and 95% credible intervals for the 2013-2014 ILI observations that contained the actual observations for most weeks in the forecast. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well after the peak of flu season has passed.","publish_time":"2015-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hickmann, Kyle S.; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Priedhorsky, Reid; Generous, Nicholas; Hyman, James M.; Deshpande, Alina; Del Valle, Sara Y.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eabb427018b4decc5d1e04772814238be2a6d9d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4431683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4431683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","Wikipedia","ILI"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["influenza season","CDC influenza","seasonal influenza","influenza dynamics","disease model","ILI observations","multiple strains of influenza","weekly forecast","forecast accuracy","peak of flu season","accurate prediction of ILI data","Wikipedia access logs","Prevention","disease outbreak","historical ILI records","weeks","Disease Control","systematic model bias","forecasting method","Wikipedia article access logs","modern data assimilation methods","case count data","actual observations","leading causes of morbidity","incidence","re-infection","illness","major economic impacts","hospitalization","mortality","tail","reports","effective response strategy","population","absenteeism","world","mitigation strategies","Centers","initialization","parametrization","Infectious diseases","way","epidemic","credible intervals","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.","publish_time":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stenglein, Mark D.; Jacobson, Elliott R.; Chang, Li-Wen; Sanders, Chris; Hawkins, Michelle G.; Guzman, David S-M.; Drazenovich, Tracy; Dunker, Freeland; Kamaka, Elizabeth K.; Fisher, Debbie; Reavill, Drury R.; Meola, Linda F.; Levens, Gregory; DeRisi, Joseph L.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a093f4ef60a47e5419181f6826ad4a45af198056.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4438980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4438980/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes","distinct S","infected animals","captive arenavirus-infected snakes","particular S segment genotype","novel genotypes","intrahost diversity","reassortment","individual animals","majority of snakes","viral diversity present","arenavirus evolution","genome segments","ancient recombination event","Numerous instances of recombination","new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses","segmented RNA viruses","natural arenavirus infections","viral ecology","cases intrahost","recombinant segments","complete sequence","sequencing results","metagenomic sequencing","largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses","captive intermingling of sub-","investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts","findings","emergence","intergenic regions","qRT-PCR","unusual organizations","isolates","transmission","capable of stable replication","virus isolation","superfluous content","adaptation","mutation","atypical structures","unique opportunity","disease potential","ensembles","imbalance","population level","extent","form","virions","culture","mammals"],"language":"en"},

Isothermal amplification techniques, such as reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) because they are quick, easy to perform and do not require complex, dedicated equipment and laboratory space. In this study, we assessed the ability of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay to detect acute HIV infection as compared to a representative rapid antibody test and several FDA-approved laboratory-based assays. The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a lab-based qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of detecting acute HIV infection using the RT-LAMP assay. The availability of a rapid NAAT, such as the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay, at the point of care (POC) or in laboratories that do not have access to large platform NAAT could increase the percentage of individuals who receive an acute HIV infection status or confirmation of their HIV status, while immediately linking them to counseling and medical care. In addition, early knowledge of HIV status could lead to reduced high-risk behavior at a time when individuals are at a higher risk for transmitting the virus.","publish_time":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudolph, Donna L.; Sullivan, Vickie; Owen, S.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all ARDS patients who met the Berlin definition and underwent open lung biopsy from January 1999 to January 2014 in a referred medical center. DAD is characterized by hyaline membrane formation, lung edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and alveolar epithelial cell injury. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, severity of ARDS, clinical and pathological diagnoses, and survival outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1838 patients with ARDS were identified and open lung biopsies were performed on 101 patients (5.5 %) during the study period. Of these 101 patients, the severity of ARDS on diagnosis was mild of 16.8 %, moderate of 56.5 % and severe of 26.7 %. The hospital mortality rate was not significant difference between the three groups (64.7 % vs 61.4 % vs 55.6 %, p = 0.81). Of the 101 clinical ARDS patients with open lung biopsies, 56.4 % (57/101) patients had DAD according to biopsy results. The proportion of DAD were 76.5 % (13/17) in mild, 56.1 % (32/57) in moderate and 44.4 % (12/27) in severe ARDS and there is no significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.113). Pathological findings of DAD patients had a higher hospital mortality rate than non-DAD patients (71.9 % vs 45.5 %, p = 0.007).

A structured workshop with experts was conducted to identify HR crises and their descriptions, as well as causes and consequences for patients and hospitals. To evaluate the findings, an online survey was carried out to rate the occurrence (past, future) and dangerousness of each crisis. RESULTS: Six HR crises were identified in this study: staff shortages, acute loss of personnel following a pandemic, damage to reputation, insufficient communication during restructuring, bullying, and misuse of drugs. The highest occurrence probability in the future was seen in staff shortages, followed by acute loss of personnel following a pandemic. Staff shortages, damage to reputation, and acute loss of personnel following a pandemic were seen as the most dangerous crises. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that coping with HR crises in hospitals is existential for hospitals and requires increased awareness. The six HR crises identified occurred regularly in German hospitals in the past, and their occurrence probability for the future was rated as high.","publish_time":"2015-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schermuly, Carsten C; Draheim, Michael; Glasberg, Ronald; Stantchev, Vladimir; Tamm, Gerrit; Hartmann, Michael; Hessel, Franz","journal":"Hum Resour Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a0431988ea52e498b029c4e4af13f34d51b4e89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4453019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4453019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dangerous crises","evaluation of relevant HR crises","German hospitals","HR sector","acute loss of personnel","pandemic","future","staff shortages","reputation","damage","study","past","highest occurrence probability","crisis-prone","raised awareness","organizational resilience","increased awareness","quantitative methods","hospitals\u2019 organizational culture","identification","limited labour force","medical care","high-tech environment","insufficient communication","restructuring","causes","area of human resource","experts","causations","process robustness","complexity","consequences","patients","effective defence","dangerousness","capacity","descriptions","findings","online survey","paper","structured workshop","BACKGROUND","industries","RESULTS","misuse of drugs","aim","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Individual antibodies only partially neutralize GM-CSF activity using an in vitro bioassay, depending on the experimental conditions, while, when injected in mice together with human GM-CSF, they lead to the accumulation of a large pool of circulating GM-CSF that remains partially bioavailable. In contrast, a combination of three non-cross-competing antibodies completely neutralizes GM-CSF activity in vitro by sequestering the cytokine in high-molecular-weight complexes, and in vivo promotes the rapid degradation of GM-CSF-containing immune complexes in an Fc-dependent manner.

This virus gradually became the main subtype of PEDV worldwide. However, there were no reports of mild pathogenicity of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China. FINDINGS: In 2013, a PEDV-positive sample from a sow with very mild clinical sign was used to inoculate in Vero cells to isolate the virus. This PEDV field strain, designated FL2013 strain, was successfully propagated and genetically characterized. The phylogenetic trees based upon either the complete genome or S gene showed that the FL2013 strain belongs to the genogroup G2b. The S gene of FL2013 has a 7-aa deletion (FEKVHVQ) in the C-terminus comparison with the other G2 PEDV sequences. Further comparative pathology study indicated that the FL2013 strain had reduced virulence to newborn piglets. CONCLUSIONS: A novel variant PEDV strain FL2013 with reduced virulence, as determined by the pathological study, was identified from east China. This strain is closely related to the genogroup- 2 PEDV strains prevalent in the U.S. and China currently, but had a short deletion at the 3\u2032- end of the spike gene.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiangbin; Pan, Yongfei; Wang, Dongdong; Tian, Xiaoyan; Song, Yanhua; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb6b4f00d820aad697369de4f7f29b709541e973.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4504071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["North","America","China","U.S."],"keyphrases":["PEDV field strain","novel variant PEDV strain FL2013","designated FL2013 strain","S gene of FL2013","PEDV strains prevalent","G2 PEDV sequences","PEDV-positive sample","main subtype of PEDV","variant Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","east China","reduced virulence","spike gene","pathological study","genogroup G2b","aa deletion","short deletion","reports of mild pathogenicity","mild clinical sign","comparative pathology study","high mortality rate","devastating viral enteric disease","sow","suckling pigs","C-terminus comparison","complete genome","FEKVHVQ","CONCLUSIONS","newborn piglets","countries","end","phylogenetic trees","Vero cells","North America","BACKGROUND","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

The Gene Ontology is designed to be applicable to all organisms but up to now has been largely under-utilized for prokaryotes and viruses, in part because of a lack of appropriate ontology terms. METHODS: To address this issue, we have developed a set of Gene Ontology classes that are applicable to microbes and their hosts, improving both coverage and quality in this area of the Gene Ontology. Describing microbial and viral gene products brings with it the additional challenge of capturing both the host and the microbe. Recognising this, we have worked closely with annotation groups to test and optimize the GO classes, and we describe here a set of annotation guidelines that allow the controlled description of two interacting organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Building on the microbial resources already in existence such as ViralZone, UniProtKB keywords and MeGO, this project provides an integrated ontology to describe interactions between microbial species and their hosts, with mappings to the external resources above. Housing this information within the freely-accessible Gene Ontology project allows the classes and annotation structure to be utilized by a large community of biologists and users.","publish_time":"2015-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foulger, R.

Thus, we investigated the importance of basal autophagy for HSV-2 infection, using pharmacological autophagy suppression or cells genetically deficient in an autophagy-essential gene (ATG5). Interference with basal autophagy flux in cells significantly reduced viral replication and diminished the infection. These results indicate that basal autophagy plays an indispensable role required for a productive infection.

Previously, due to its \u201Ccomplete insolubility\u201D, the isolated NS3pro could not be experimentally studied and it remains elusive what structure it adopts without NS2B and why NS2B is indispensable. Here as facilitated by our previous discovery, the isolated NS3pro has been surprisingly deciphered by NMR to be the first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold, which exists in a loosely-packed state with non-native long-range interactions as revealed by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The disordered NS3pro appears to be needed for binding a human host factor to trigger the membrane remodeling. Moreover, we have in vitro refolded the NS3pro in complex with either NS2B (48\u2013100) or the full-length NS2B (1\u2013130) anchored into the LMPC micelle, and the two complexes have similar activities but different dynamics. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results revealed that NS2B shows the highest structural fluctuations in the complex, thus providing the dynamic basis for the observation on its conformational exchange between open and closed states. Remarkably, the NS2B cofactor plays a central role in maintaining the correlated motion network required for the catalysis as we previously decoded for the SARS 3CL protease. Indeed, a truncated NS2B (48\u2013100;\u039477\u201384) with the flexible loop deleted is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a highly dynamic and catalytically-impotent state.

This generates an increasing need for transparent and replicable tools that could be used to set investment priorities, monitor the distribution of funding in real time, and evaluate the impact of those investments. METHODS: In this paper we present a methodology that addresses these three challenges. We call this approach PLANET, which stands for planning, monitoring and evaluation tool. Fundamentally, PLANET is based on crowdsourcing approach to obtaining information relevant to deployment of large\u2013scale programs. Information is contributed in real time by a diverse group of participants involved in the program delivery. FINDINGS: PLANET relies on real\u2013time information from three levels of participants in large\u2013scale programs: funders, managers and recipients. At each level, information is solicited to assess five key risks that are most relevant to each level of operations. The risks at the level of funders involve systematic neglect of certain areas, focus on donor\u2019s interests over that of program recipients, ineffective co\u2013ordination between donors, questionable mechanisms of delivery and excessive loss of funding to \u201Cmiddle men\u201D. At the level of managers, the risks are corruption, lack of capacity and/or competence, lack of information and /or communication, undue avoidance of governmental structures / preference to non\u2013governmental organizations and exclusion of local expertise. At the level of primary recipients, the risks are corruption, parallel operations / \u201Cverticalization\u201D, misalignment with local priorities and lack of community involvement, issues with ethics, equity and/or acceptability, and low likelihood of sustainability beyond the end of the program\u2019s implementation. INTERPRETATION: PLANET is intended as an additional tool available to policy\u2013makers to prioritize, monitor and evaluate large\u2013scale development programs. In this, it should complement tools such as LiST (for health care/interventions), EQUIST (for health care/interventions) and CHNRI (for health research), which also rely on information from local experts and on local context to set priorities in a transparent, user\u2013friendly, replicable, quantifiable and specific, algorithmic\u2013like manner.","publish_time":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sridhar, Devi; Car, Josip; Chopra, Mickey; Campbell, Harry; Woods, Ngaire; Rudan, Igor","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a573001d0844b483871d264983ef4a6d9fde937.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4544236.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544236/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International","Information"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lack of information","time information","information relevant","local priorities","level of funders","level of operations","level of managers","real time","health care","scale programs","level of primary recipients","approach PLANET","scale development programs","local context","local experts","health research","program recipients","key risks","corruption","interventions","lack of capacity","deployment of large","exclusion of local expertise","program delivery","replicable tools","investment priorities","lack of community involvement","levels of participants","governmental organizations","distribution of funding","parallel operations","crowdsourcing approach","evaluation tool","excessive loss of funding","questionable mechanisms of delivery","diverse group of participants","International development assistance","additional tool available","undue avoidance of governmental structures","preference","ordination","communication","verticalization","EQUIST","systematic neglect of certain areas","end","acceptability","ethics","donors","issues","donor\u2019s interests","user","CHNRI","misalignment","low likelihood of sustainability","equity","policy","makers","BACKGROUND","DAH","increasing need","planning","LiST","competence","middle men","impact","program\u2019s implementation","paper","methodology","manner","FINDINGS","METHODS","challenges","investments","INTERPRETATION"],"language":"en"},

The transcriptome analysis of the cows\u2019 blood identified a substantially higher number of loci affected in BC cows (2,235) in response to vaccination compared to AC cows (208) and revealed a divergent transcriptional profile specific for each group. In BC cows, a variety of loci involved in immune defense and cellular signaling processes were transcriptionally activated, whereas protein biosynthesis and posttranslational processes were tremendously impaired in response to vaccination. Furthermore, energy metabolism in the blood cells of BC cows was shifted from oxidative phosphorylation to the glycolytic system. In AC cows, the number and variety of regulated pathways involved in immunomodulation and maintenance of immnunocompetence are considerably lower after vaccination, and upregulation of arginine degradation was suggested as an immunosuppressive mechanism. Elevated transcript levels of erythrocyte-specific genes involved in gas exchange processes were a specific transcriptional signature in AC cows pointing to hematopoiesis activation. The divergent and substantially lower magnitude of transcriptional modulation in response to vaccination in AC cows provides evidence for a suppressed immune capacity of early lactating cows on the molecular level and demonstrates that an efficient immune response of cows is related to their physiological and metabolic status.","publish_time":"2015-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weikard, Rosemarie; Demasius, Wiebke; Hadlich, Frieder; K\u00FChn, Christa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7432dbac9b72daf18b639ba85a59b2e676b6b09c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4552870.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AC cows","Periparturient cows","efficient immune response of cows","blood cells of BC cows","vaccination","suppressed immune capacity of early lactating cows","specific transcriptional signature","divergent transcriptional profile specific","specific genes","posttranslational processes","lower magnitude of transcriptional modulation","immune defense","variety of loci","calving","gas exchange processes","higher number of loci","molecular level","cows\u2019 blood","transcriptome analysis","transcriptome sequencing","gene expression modulation","variety of regulated pathways","molecular regulatory mechanisms","evidence","antigen challenge","increased susceptibility","immunomodulation","Elevated transcript levels of erythrocyte","oxidative phosphorylation","maintenance of immnunocompetence","upregulation of arginine degradation","mammary infections","causes","effect","phenomenon","protein biosynthesis","group","energy metabolism","hematopoiesis activation","glycolytic system","understanding","immunosuppression","immunosuppressive mechanism","metabolic status","RNAseq"],"language":"en"},

The efficacy of HDCA in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (BMT/PBSCT), however, has not yet been elucidated. FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of HDCA/CY/TBI (N = 435) and CY/TBI (N = 1667) in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS using a Japanese transplant registry database. The median age was 38 years, and 86.0 % of the patients had AML. Unrelated donors comprised 54.6 %, and 63.9 % of donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched. Overall survival (OS) was not improved in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; p = 0.13). Neutrophil engraftment was inferior (HR, 0.80; p \u003C 0.01), and the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and thrombotic microangiopathy increased in HDCA/CY/TBI (HR, 1.47 and 1.60; p = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively), leading to significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM; HR, 1.48; p \u003C 0.01). Post-transplant relapse and tumor-related mortality were not suppressed by the addition of HDCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the inefficacy of HDCA/CY/TBI in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS.

CHIKV re-emerged in 2004 with multiple outbreaks worldwide and recently reached the Americas where it has infected over a million individuals in a rapidly expanding epidemic. While alphavirus replication is well understood in general, the specific function (s) of non-structural protein nsP3 remain elusive. CHIKV nsP3 modulates the mammalian stress response by preventing stress granule formation through sequestration of G3BP. In mosquitoes, nsP3 is a determinant of vector specificity, but its functional interaction with mosquito proteins is unclear. METHODS: In this research we studied the domains required for localization of CHIKV nsP3 in insect cells and demonstrated its molecular interaction with Rasputin (Rin), the mosquito homologue of G3BP. The biological involvement of Rin in CHIKV infection was investigated in live Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. RESULTS: In insect cells, nsP3 localized as cytoplasmic granules, which was dependent on the central domain and the C-terminal variable region but independent of the N-terminal macrodomain. Ae. albopictus Rin displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization, but was effectively sequestered into nsP3-granules upon nsP3 co-expression. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the Rin-nsP3 interaction involved the NTF2-like domain of Rin and two conserved TFGD repeats in the C-terminal variable domain of nsP3. Although in vitro silencing of Rin did not impact nsP3 localization or CHIKV replication in cell culture, Rin depletion in vivo significantly decreased the CHIKV infection rate and transmissibility in Ae.albopictus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the nsP3 hypervariable C-terminal domain as a critical factor for granular localization and sequestration of mosquito Rin. Our study offers novel insight into a conserved virus-mosquito interaction at the molecular level, and reveals a strong proviral role for G3BP homologue Rin in live mosquitoes, making the nsP3-Rin interaction a putative target to interfere with the CHIKV transmission cycle.","publish_time":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fros, Jelke J.; Geertsema, Corinne; Zouache, Karima; Baggen, Jim; Domeradzka, Natalia; van Leeuwen, Dani\u00EBl M.; Flipse, Jacky; Vlak, Just M.; Failloux, Anna-Bella; Pijlman, Gorben P.","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6967246e5306fe96a9d5dd77e670bd95dc3e0b6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4573678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4573678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rin"],"organizations":["CHIKV","TFGD"],"locations":["Americas"],"keyphrases":["Rin-nsP3 interaction","nsP3-Rin interaction","localization of CHIKV nsP3","nsP3 localization","domain of Rin","nsP3-granules","albopictus Rin","Rin depletion","silencing of Rin","sequestration of mosquito Rin","C-terminal variable domain of nsP3","CHIKV replication","G3BP homologue Rin","nsP3 hypervariable C-terminal domain","non-structural protein nsP3","nsP3 co-expression","biological involvement of Rin","CHIKV infection rate","molecular interaction","albopictus mosquitoes","CHIKV transmission cycle","conserved virus-mosquito interaction","functional interaction","cytoplasmic localization","mosquito homologue of G3BP","live mosquitoes","C-terminal variable region","granular localization","central domain","sequestration of G3BP","mosquito proteins","insect cells","N-terminal macrodomain","cytoplasmic granules","alphavirus replication","Aedes species mosquitoes","molecular level","Chikungunya virus","arthritogenic alphavirus","stress granule formation","mammalian stress response","conserved TFGD repeats","critical factor","strong proviral role","cell culture","putative target","transmissibility","specific function","family Togaviridae","determinant of vector specificity","NTF2","novel insight","domains","Rasputin","study","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","mutagenesis","multiple outbreaks","individuals","expanding epidemic","research","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Americas","Site"],"language":"en"},

Development of vaccines for young infants is complicated by the presence of maternal antibodies and immunological immaturity, but vaccines targeted at older children avoid these problems. Vaccine development for young infants has been unsuccessful, but this is not the case for older children (\u003E 6m). Would vaccinating older children have a significant public health impact? We developed a mathematical model to explore the benefits of a vaccine against RSV. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have used a deterministic age structured model capturing the key epidemiological characteristics of RSV and performed a statistical maximum-likelihood fit to age-specific hospitalization data from a developing country setting. To explore the effects of vaccination under different mixing assumptions, we included two versions of contact matrices: one from a social contact diary study, and the second a synthesised construction based on demographic data. Vaccination is assumed to elicit an immune response equivalent to primary infection. Our results show that immunisation of young children (5\u201310m) is likely to be a highly effective method of protection of infants (\u003C6m) against hospitalisation. The majority benefit is derived from indirect protection (herd immunity). A full sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling of the parameter space shows that our results are robust to model structure and model parameters.

Subsequently, the recombinant plasmids (pET21a-PapG.AcmA and pET21a-PapG) were transformed into the E. coli Origami strain using the calcium chloride method and the fusion protein was expressed under 1 mM IPTG induction. The expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting. Purification of the PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins was carried out using a Ni-NTA column, and surface adsorption was estimated on Lactobacillus. Finally, surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The PapG.AcmA fusion was successfully sub-cloned in the pET21a expression vector. The expression of PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins in the E. coli Origami strain was indicated as protein bands in SDS-PAGE and confirmed by western blotting. In addition, the fusion protein was displayed on the surface of L. reuteri. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we developed a method to express the PapG.AcmA protein on the surface of Lactobacillus. This is the first report on the successful application of lactic acid bacteria displaying the PapG.AcmA fusion protein. It will be interesting to determine the immune responses against the PapG protein in near future using this surface display strategy.","publish_time":"2015-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashrafi, Fatemeh; Fallah Mehrabadi, Jalil; Siadat, Seyed Davar; Aghasadeghi, Mohammad Reza","journal":"Jundishapur J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a24b5a764c19d383dbfe795779b18799c6d2f4e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4609037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PapG.AcmA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PapG protein","pET21a-PapG","expression of PapG","AcmA fusion protein","coli PapG antigen","AcmA fusion gene","AcmA gene","AcmA proteins","protein bands","anchor protein","surface of Lactobacillus","pET21a expression vector","surface adsorption","surface localization","Lactobacillus reuteri","coli Origami strain","surface display strategy","immune system","SDS-PAGE","use of lactic acid bacteria","common bacteria","promising method","Uropathogenic Escherichia coli","study","systemic immune responses","western blotting","UTIs","successful application of lactic acid bacteria","calcium chloride method","delivery system","safe vaccine","human vaccine","sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","near future","BamHI","NdeI","urinary tract infections","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA","BACKGROUND","UPEC","Ni-NTA column","digestion sites","recombinant plasmids","report","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","aim","MATERIALS","METHODS","pEX","addition","Purification","IPTG induction","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Based on previous studies identifying a causative role for anti-cytokine autoantibodies in patients with opportunistic infections, we explored this possibility in PHN. METHODS: Sera from herpes zoster (HZ) patients without and with PHN (N = 115 and 83, respectively) were examined for the presence of autoantibodies against multiple cytokines, and other known autoantigens. In addition, a cohort of patients with complex regional pain syndrome or neuropathic pain was tested for autoantibodies against selected cytokines. Antibody levels against VZV, Epstein Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus-2 were also measured in the HZ and PHN patients. Patient sera with high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies were functionally tested for in vitro neutralizing activity. RESULTS: Six PHN subjects demonstrated markedly elevated levels of single, autoantibodies against interferon-\u03B1, interferon-\u03B3, GM-CSF, or interleukin-6. In contrast, the HZ and the pain control group showed low or no autoantibodies, respectively, against these four cytokines. Further analysis revealed that one PHN patient with high levels of anti-interleukin-6 autoantibodies had a markedly depressed antibody level to VZV, potentially reflecting poor T cell immunity against VZV. In vitro functional testing revealed that three of the five anti-cytokine autoantibody positive PHN subjects had neutralizing autoantibodies against interferon-\u03B1, GM-CSF or interleukin-6. In contrast, none of the HZ patients without PHN had neutralizing autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the possibility that sporadic anti-cytokine autoantibodies in some subjects may cause an autoimmune immunodeficiency syndrome leading to uncontrolled VZV reactivation, nerve damage and subsequent PHN.","publish_time":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayat, Ahmad; Burbelo, Peter D.; Browne, Sarah K.; Quinlivan, Mark; Martinez, Bianca; Holland, Steven M.; Buvanendran, Asokumar; Kroin, Jeffrey S.; Mannes, Andrew J.; Breuer, Judith; Cohen, Jeffrey I.; Iadarola, Michael J.","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76681fffce58a9c3e3c125f37c40ed5388b97a30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4617715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4617715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epstein Barr"],"organizations":["PHN","VZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHN patients","presence of autoantibodies","high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies","sporadic anti-cytokine autoantibodies","subsequent PHN","HZ patients","cytokine autoantibody positive PHN subjects","high levels of anti-interleukin","Antibody levels","cohort of patients","uncontrolled VZV reactivation","neuropathic pain","interferon-\u03B1","complex regional pain syndrome","interferon-\u03B3","pain control group","elevated levels of single","varicella zoster virus","herpes simplex virus","herpes zoster","Patient sera","possibility","GM-CSF","multiple cytokines","RESULTS","selected cytokines","contrast","neutralizing activity","debilitating chronic pain condition","Epstein Barr virus","autoimmune immunodeficiency syndrome","depressed antibody level","reflecting poor T cell immunity","causative role","nerve damage","opportunistic infections","postherpetic neuralgia","mechanisms","previous studies","known autoantigens","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","addition","analysis","functional testing"],"language":"en"},

Here, we study spatial organization of DNA synthesis during multiround transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) using pulse-labeling with ethynyl nucleotides and cycloaddition of azide fluorophores. We report a hitherto unknown and unexpected outcome of virus-host interaction. Consistent with the current understanding of the single-step growth cycle, HSV suppresses host DNA synthesis and promotes viral DNA synthesis in spatially segregated compartments within the cell. In striking contrast, during progressive rounds of infection initiated at a single cell, we observe that infection induces a clear and pronounced stimulation of cellular DNA replication in remote uninfected cells. This induced DNA synthesis was observed in hundreds of uninfected cells at the extended border, outside the perimeter of the progressing infection. Moreover, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that this activation is maintained, resulting in a propagating wave of host DNA synthesis continually in advance of infection. As the virus reaches and infects these activated cells, host DNA synthesis is then shut off and replaced with virus DNA synthesis. Using nonpropagating viruses or conditioned medium, we demonstrate a paracrine effector of uninfected cell DNA synthesis in remote cells continually in advance of infection. These findings have significant implications, likely with broad applicability, for our understanding of the ways in which virus infection manipulates cell processes not only in the infected cell itself but also now in remote uninfected cells, as well as of mechanisms governing host DNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE We show that during infection initiated by a single particle with progressive cell-cell virus transmission (i.e., the normal situation), HSV induces host DNA synthesis in uninfected cells, mediated by a virus-induced paracrine effector. The field has had no conception that this process occurs, and the work changes our interpretation of virus-host interaction during advancing infection and has implications for understanding controls of host DNA synthesis. Our findings demonstrate the utility of chemical biology techniques in analysis of infection processes, reveal distinct processes when infection is examined in multiround transmission versus single-step growth curves, and reveal a hitherto-unknown process in virus infection, likely relevant for other viruses (and other infectious agents) and for remote signaling of other processes, including transcription and protein synthesis.","publish_time":"2015-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmidt, Nora; Hennig, Thomas; Serwa, Remigiusz A.; Marchetti, Magda; O\u0027Hare, Peter","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e622c993d64e1bdcb0b7ec5505945ab5fbe3185e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4621119.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4621119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus DNA synthesis","virus infection","induced DNA synthesis","viral DNA synthesis","controls of host DNA synthesis","paracrine effector of uninfected cell DNA synthesis","propagating wave of host DNA synthesis","spatial organization of DNA synthesis","protein synthesis","cell processes","advance of infection","analysis of infection processes","progressive cell-cell virus transmission","advancing infection","single cell","progressing infection","host interaction","remote uninfected cells","remote cells","interpretation of virus","progressive rounds of infection","stimulation of cellular DNA replication","hundreds of uninfected cells","unexpected outcome of virus","cellular processes","activated cells","multiround transmission of herpes simplex virus","HSV","distinct processes","single particle","single-step growth cycle","single-step growth curves","nonpropagating viruses","unknown process","current understanding","findings","pulse-chase analysis","significant implications","diverse ways","utility of chemical biology techniques","ethynyl nucleotides","broad applicability","metabolism","normal situation","segregated compartments","extended border","cycloaddition of azide fluorophores","perimeter","mechanisms","striking contrast","infectious agents","work","transcription","conception","field","activation","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

This study examines the effects of the route of administration of a live attenuated vaccine on its interactions with, and stimulation of, the murine immune system as well as its ability to increase survival and provide protection from colonisation by a virulent challenge strain. We assess the effect of administration method using the murine model for typhoid, where animals are infected with S. Typhimurium. Mice were vaccinated either intravenously or orally with the same live attenuated S. Typhimurium strain and data were collected on vaccine strain growth, shedding and stimulation of antibodies and cytokines. Following vaccination, mice were challenged with a virulent strain of S. Typhimurium and the protection conferred by the different vaccination routes was measured in terms of challenge suppression and animal survival. The main difference in immune stimulation found in this study was the development of a secretory IgA response in orally-vaccinated mice, which was absent in IV vaccinated mice. While both strains showed similar protection in terms of challenge suppression in systemic organs (spleen and liver) as well as survival, they differed in terms of challenge suppression of virulent pathogens in gut-associated organs. This difference in gut colonisation presents important questions around the ability of vaccines to prevent shedding and transmission. These findings demonstrate that while protection conferred by two vaccines can appear to be the same, the mechanisms controlling the protection can differ and have important implications for infection dynamics within a population.","publish_time":"2015-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kinnear, Clare L.; Strugnell, Richard A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a65b8907068dde79fb7cc6e885a745607ed1f371.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4625024.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4625024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S.

Up-regulation of TGF-\u03B2 in serum/peritoneal fluid and increased levels of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 in endometriotic tissues are frequently observed in patients with endometriosis. However, the mechanisms underlying how TGF-\u03B2/TGF-\u03B2 receptor and OCT4 affect endometriotic cell migration still remain largely unknown. Therefore, endometriotic tissue with high cell migratory capacity were collected from patients with adenomyotic myometrium (n = 23) and chocolate cyst (n = 24); and endometrial tissue with low cell migratory capacity in normal endometrium or hyperplastic endometrium (n = 8) were collected as the controls. We found the mRNA levels of TGF-\u03B2 receptor I (TGF-\u03B2 RI) and OCT4 were significantly higher in the high-migratory ectopic endometriotic tissues than those of the low-migratory normal or hyperplastic endometrium. Positive correlations between TGF-\u03B2 RI and OCT4, and either TGF-\u03B2 RI or OCT4 with migration-related genes (SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST) regarding the mRNA levels were observed in human endometriotic tissues. TGF-\u03B2I dose-dependently increased the gene and protein levels of OCT4, SNAIL and N-Cadherin (N-CAD) and silencing of endogenous OCT4 significantly suppressed the TGF-\u03B2I-induced expressions of N-CAD and SNAIL in primary human endometriotic stromal cells and human endometrial carcinoma cell lines RL95-2 and HEC1A. Furthermore, TGF-\u03B2I significantly increased the migration ability of endometriotic cells and silencing of OCT4 dramatically suppressed the TGF-\u03B2I-induced cell migration activity evidenced by wound-closure assay, transwell assay, and confocal image of F-actin cellular distribution. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that the niche TGF-\u03B2 plays a critical role in initiating expressions of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 which may contribute to the ectopic endometrial growth by stimulating endometrial cell migration. These findings would be useful for developing therapeutic strategies targeting TGF-\u03B2-OCT4 signaling to prevent endometriosis in the future.","publish_time":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Au, Heng-Kien; Chang, Jui-Hung; Wu, Yu-Chih; Kuo, Yung-Che; Chen, Yu-Hsi; Lee, Wei-Chin; Chang, Te-Sheng; Lan, Pei-Chi; Kuo, Hung-Chih; Lee, Kha-Liang; Lee, Mei-Tsu; Tzeng, Chii-Ruey; Huang, Yen-Hua","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73962bb05d0fa45657756857801fbb3f9e139b04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4682958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGF-\u03B2 RI","niche TGF-\u03B2","regulation of TGF","TGF-\u03B2 receptor signal","mRNA levels of TGF","endometriotic cell migration","TGF-\u03B2I dose","silencing of OCT4","endometrial cell migration","protein levels of OCT4","human endometriotic tissues","silencing of endogenous OCT4","migration ability of endometriotic cells","induced cell migration activity","increased levels of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4","low cell migratory capacity","high cell migratory capacity","high-migratory ectopic endometriotic tissues","N-Cadherin","initiating expressions of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4","induced expressions of N","SNAIL","endometrial tissue","human endometrial carcinoma cell lines RL95","primary human endometriotic stromal cells","low-migratory normal","ectopic endometrial growth","migration-related genes","normal endometrium","hyperplastic endometrium","growth factor","patients","endometriosis","transwell assay","present findings","wound-closure assay","confocal image of F","critical role","peritoneal fluid","serum","SLUG","TWIST","actin cellular distribution","therapeutic strategies","Positive correlations","adenomyotic myometrium","HEC1A","chocolate cyst","conclusion","mechanisms","future","controls"],"language":"en"},

The rapid diagnosis of EI is essential to reduce the disease spread. Many rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for diagnosing human influenza are available, but their ability to diagnose EI has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of 22 RAD tests in the diagnosis of EI. METHODS: The 22 RAD tests were performed on fivefold serial dilutions of EI virus to determine their detection limits. The four most sensitive RAD tests (ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A\u0026B\u2010N) were further evaluated using nasopharyngeal samples collected from experimentally infected and naturally infected horses. The results were compared to those obtained using molecular tests. RESULTS: The detection limits of the 22 RAD tests varied hugely. Even the four RAD tests showing the best sensitivity were 125\u2010fold less sensitive than the molecular techniques. The duration of virus detection in the experimentally infected horses was shorter using the RAD tests than using the molecular techniques. The RAD tests detected between 27% and 73% of real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR\u2010positive samples from naturally infected horses. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the importance of choosing the right RAD tests as only three of 22 were fit for diagnosing EI. It was also indicated that even RAD tests with the highest sensitivity serve only as an adjunct to molecular tests because of the potential for false\u2010negative results.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamanaka, Takashi; Nemoto, Manabu; Bannai, Hiroshi; Tsujimura, Koji; Kondo, Takashi; Matsumura, Tomio; Gildea, Sarah; Cullinane, Ann","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/481c14a837af6dd6d5a5d8f3a26ae6cc51cca2f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4746556.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4746556/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EI","RAD","ESPLINE Influenza A\u0026B\u2010N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitive RAD tests","molecular tests","right RAD tests","diagnosing EI","infected horses","rapid diagnosis of EI","detection limits","molecular techniques","duration of virus detection","rapid antigen detection","fivefold serial dilutions of EI virus","ImmunoAce Flu","ESPLINE Influenza","human influenza","Equine influenza","study","negative results","BD Flu examan","Quick chaser Flu","positive samples","best sensitivity","highest sensitivity","nasopharyngeal samples","contagious disease","disease spread","potential","PCR","adjunct","importance","viruses","real\u2010time RT","BACKGROUND","ability","performance","H3N8 subtype","OBJECTIVES","aim","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Stool could replace sputum for diagnostic TB testing if adequate sample processing techniques were available. METHODS: We developed a rapid method to process large volumes of stool for downstream testing by the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) TB-detection assay. The method was tested and optimized on stool samples spiked with known numbers of M. tuberculosis colony forming units (CFU), and stools from M. tuberculosis-infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Performance was scored on number of positive Xpert tests, the cycle thresholds (Cts) of the Xpert sample-processing control (SPC), and the Cts of the M. tuberculosis-specific rpoB probes. The method was then validated on 20 confirmed TB cases and 20 controls in Durban, South Africa. RESULTS: The assay\u2019s analytical limit of detection was 1,000 CFU/g of stool. As much as one gram of spiked stool could be tested without showing increased PCR inhibition. In analytical spiking experiments using human stool, 1g samples provided the best sensitivity compared to smaller amounts of sample. However, in Macaques with TB, 0.6g stool samples performed better than either 0.2g or 1.2g samples. Testing the stool of pediatric TB suspects and controls suggested an assay sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 0.6\u20130.9) and 84% (95% CI 0.6\u20130.96) for 0.6g and 1.2g stool samples, respectively, and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.77\u20131) and 94% (95% CI 0.7\u20130.99), respectively.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been identified as an enzyme associated with immunoregulatory function. Although the regulatory role of IDO in viral replication has been postulated, the in vivo role of IDO activity has not been fully addressed in neurotropic virus-caused encephalitis. METHODS: Mice in which IDO activity was inhibited by genetic ablation or using a specific inhibitor were examined for mortality and clinical signs after infection. Neuroinflammation was evaluated by central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of leukocytes and cytokine expression. IDO expression, viral burden, JEV-specific T-cell, and type I/II interferon (IFN-I/II) innate responses were also analyzed. RESULTS: Elevated expression of IDO activity in myeloid and neuron cells of the lymphoid and CNS tissues was closely associated with clinical signs of JE. Furthermore, inhibition of IDO activity enhanced resistance to JE, reduced the viral burden in lymphoid and CNS tissues, and resulted in early and increased CNS infiltration by Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, NK, CD4(\u002B), and CD8(\u002B) T-cells. JE amelioration in IDO-ablated mice was also associated with enhanced NK and JEV-specific T-cell responses. More interestingly, IDO ablation induced rapid enhancement of type I IFN (IFN-I) innate responses in CD11c(\u002B) dendritic cells (DCs), including conventional and plasmacytoid DCs, following JEV infection. This enhanced IFN-I innate response in IDO-ablated CD11c(\u002B) DCs was coupled with strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7, STAT1), and antiviral ISG genes (Mx1, Mx2, ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). IDO ablation also enhanced the IFN-I innate response in neuron cells, which may delay the spread of virus in the CNS. Finally, we identified that IDO ablation in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) dominantly contributed to JE amelioration and that HSC-derived leukocytes played a key role in the enhanced IFN-I innate responses in the IDO-ablated environment. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of IDO activity ameliorated JE via enhancement of antiviral IFN-I/II innate and adaptive T-cell responses and increased CNS infiltration of peripheral leukocytes. Therefore, our data provide valuable insight into the use of IDO inhibition by specific inhibitors as a promising tool for therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against viral encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses.","publish_time":"2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Seong Bum; Choi, Jin Young; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Hur, Jin; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John-Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/213fdedff656134ff3dbe24a7d7bbba61d13baa1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4835894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4835894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDO","CNS","NK","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IDO ablation","IDO expression","inhibition of IDO activity","role of IDO activity","IDO-ablated mice","IDO-ablated CD11c","use of IDO inhibition","regulatory role of IDO","IDO-ablated environment","Elevated expression of IDO activity","enhanced IFN","innate responses","T-cells","JE amelioration","neurotropic JE virus","CNS tissues","myeloid cells","JEV-specific T-cell responses","neuron cells","enhancement of antiviral IFN","clinical signs of JE","viral burden","JEV infection","dendritic cells","enhanced NK","adaptive T-cell responses","infiltration of leukocytes","increased CNS infiltration of peripheral leukocytes","viral replication","leading cause of viral encephalitis","hematopoietic stem cells","specific inhibitors","Japanese encephalitis","genetic ablation","plasmacytoid DCs","HSC-derived leukocytes","key role","cytokine expression","neurotropic viruses","spread of virus","rapid enhancement of type","extensive neuroinflammation","antiviral ISG genes","Mx2","promising tool","prophylactic strategies","STAT1","Mx1","central nervous system","MDA5","ISG49","IRF7","Ly","mortality","HSCs","resistance","valuable insight","RIG","transcription factors","ISG54","strong induction of PRRs","RESULTS","ISG56","data","CD4","monocytes","CD8","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","enzyme","immunoregulatory function","Indoleamine","dioxygenase","interferon"],"language":"en"},

Enteroviruses utilize their encoded proteinases to take over the cellular translation apparatus and direct ribosomes to viral mRNAs. In addition, viral proteinases are used to control and repress the two main types of cytoplasmic RNA granules, stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are stress-responsive dynamic structures involved in repression of gene expression. This review discusses these processes and the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms with respect to enterovirus infections. In addition, the review discusses accumulating data suggesting linkage exists between RNA granule formation and innate immune sensing and activation.","publish_time":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lloyd, Richard E.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6695dd7f637481312d8589cbc32aa3bef1c816a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4848588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stress granules","viral proteinases","cellular gene expression","stress responses","efficient expression","repression of gene expression","viral mRNAs","viral genome","review","addition","Enteroviruses","stress-responsive dynamic structures","processing bodies","P-bodies","encoded proteinases","main types of cytoplasmic RNA granules","RNA granule formation","cellular translation apparatus","SGs","underlying mechanisms","innate immune sensing","linkage","direct ribosomes","accumulating data","respect","CVB3","current understanding","PV","parallel strategies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We evaluate the influence of the antitumoral fraction of the E. tirucalli latex in the larynx squamous cell carcinoma (Hep-2), on the morphology, cell proliferation and gene expression. The Hep-2 cells were cultivated in complete medium (MEM 10 %) and treated with E. tirucalli latex for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. After statistically analyzing the proliferation of the tested cells, the cells were cultivated again for RNA extraction and the Rapid Subtractive Hybridization (RaSH) technique was used to identify genes with altered expression. The genes found using the RaSH technique were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) using Ingenuity Systems. RESULTS: The five genes found to have differential expression were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Though treatment with E. tirucalli latex did not change the cell morphology in comparison to control samples, but the cell growth was significantly decreased. The RaSH showed change in the expression of some genes, including ANXA1, TCEA1, NGFRAP1, ITPR1 and CD55, which are associated with inflammatory response, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, calcium ion transport regulation and complement system, respectively. The E. tirucalli latex treatment down-regulated ITPR1 and up-regulated ANXA1 and CD55 genes, and was validated by real-time quantitative PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate the involvement of E. tirucalli latex in the altered expression of genes involved in tumorigenic processes, which could potentially be applied as a therapeutic indicator of larynx cancer.

Extensive sequence variability within and between RSV group A and B viruses and the ability of multiple clades and sub-clades of RSV to co-circulate are likely mechanisms contributing to the evasion of herd immunity. Surveillance and large-scale whole-genome sequencing of RSV is currently limited but would help identify its evolutionary dynamics and sites of selective immune evasion. In this study, we performed complete-genome next-generation sequencing of 92 RSV isolates from infants in central Tennessee during the 2012\u20132014 RSV seasons. We identified multiple co-circulating clades of RSV from both the A and B groups. Each clade is defined by signature N- and O-linked glycosylation patterns. Analyses of specific RSV genes revealed high rates of positive selection in the attachment (G) gene. We identified RSV-A viruses in circulation with and without a recently reported 72-nucleotide G gene sequence duplication. Furthermore, we show evidence of convergent evolution of G gene sequence duplication and fixation over time, which suggests a potential fitness advantage of RSV with the G sequence duplication.","publish_time":"2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schobel, Seth A.; Stucker, Karla M.; Moore, Martin L.; Anderson, Larry J.; Larkin, Emma K.; Shankar, Jyoti; Bera, Jayati; Puri, Vinita; Shilts, Meghan H.; Rosas-Salazar, Christian; Halpin, Rebecca A.; Fedorova, Nadia; Shrivastava, Susmita; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Peebles, R.

While local infection often remains asymptomatic, severe or even fatal diseases occur when streptococci become invasive and spread to different sites in the infected host. We have established porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures (ALI) from the porcine lung to analyze the interaction of streptococci with their primary target cells. As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells. We hypothesize that soluble effectors such as suilysin are present at higher concentrations in cells kept at ALI conditions and thus more effective. These results should be relevant also for infection of the respiratory tract by other respiratory pathogens.","publish_time":"2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Fandan; Wu, Nai-Huei; Seitz, Maren; Herrler, Georg; Valentin-Weigand, Peter","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c0168a4b858a8680f305fc4d8cc3c787ff4e110.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4882623.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococci","Suilysin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway cells","immortalized cells","ALI conditions","respiratory tract","respiratory pathogens","Streptococcus suis","suilysin-deficient mutant","suis-induced apoptosis","cytolytic activity of suilysin","primary target cells","loss of ciliated cells","suis wt strain","interaction of streptococci","local infection","invasion","major swine respiratory pathogen","porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures","porcine lung","different sites","entry sites","higher concentrations","CDC","fatal diseases","high efficiency","analysis","streptococcal family","cholesterol-dependent cytolysin","airways","infected host","epithelium","soluble effectors","adherence","important virulence factor","striking result","representative","results","humans","effects","properties"],"language":"en"},

A profound understanding of the viral population in key animal species acting as reservoirs represents an important step towards this goal. Bats harbor diverse viruses, some of which are of particular interest because they cause severe human diseases. However, little is known about the diversity of the global population of viruses found in bats (virome). We determined the viral diversity of five different French insectivorous bat species (nine specimens in total) in close contact with humans. Sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing with Illumina technology and a dedicated bioinformatics analysis pipeline were used on pooled tissues (brain, liver and lungs). Comparisons of the sequences of contigs and unassembled reads provided a global taxonomic distribution of virus-related sequences for each sample, highlighting differences both within and between bat species. Many viral families were present in these viromes, including viruses known to infect bacteria, plants/fungi, insects or vertebrates, the most relevant being those infecting mammals (Retroviridae, Herpesviridae, Bunyaviridae, Poxviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Bornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae). In particular, we detected several new mammalian viruses, including rotaviruses, gammaretroviruses, bornaviruses and bunyaviruses with the identification of the first bat nairovirus. These observations demonstrate that bats naturally harbor viruses from many different families, most of which infect mammals. They may therefore constitute a major reservoir of viral diversity that should be analyzed carefully, to determine the role played by bats in the spread of zoonotic viral infections.","publish_time":"2014-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dacheux, Laurent; Cervantes-Gonzalez, Minerva; Guigon, Ghislaine; Thiberge, Jean-Michel; Vandenbogaert, Mathias; Maufrais, Corinne; Caro, Val\u00E9rie; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ec3cfefcf560550c37dbc48107102bf2c893036.json; document_parses/pdf_json/af28c7f2e54f09c2ee5ea579d8646768a3be25c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3906132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3906132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral population","viral families","Bats","global population of viruses","major reservoir of viral diversity","diverse viruses","new mammalian viruses","prediction of viral zoonosis epidemics","spread of zoonotic viral infections","different French insectivorous bat species","different families","bat nairovirus","key animal species","sequences of contigs","infecting mammals","global taxonomic distribution of virus-related sequences","major public health issue","Illumina technology","specimens","high-throughput sequencing","dedicated bioinformatics analysis pipeline","Flaviviridae","pooled tissues","Poxviridae","Retroviridae","Herpesviridae","Bunyaviridae","rotaviruses","unassembled reads","total","insects","Reoviridae","reservoirs","plants","gammaretroviruses","Sequence-independent amplification","brain","liver","fungi","vertebrates","Bornaviridae","bornaviruses","bunyaviruses","close contact","sample","identification","bacteria","differences","viromes","important step","profound understanding","lungs","humans","Picobirnaviridae","severe human diseases","goal","Comparisons"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A systematic sampling method was used to randomly sample a representative database from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database in Taiwan, during the period from 2000 to 2004. RESULTS: We identified 10,124, 10,408, 11,209, 10,686, and 11,914 emergency room visits in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. There were more males than females, and the majority of adults were younger than 50 years. Diagnose of injury/poisoning was the most frequently noted diagnostic category in emergency departments (EDs) in Taiwan. There were 13,196 (24.3%) and 2,952 (5.4%) patients with 2 and 3 concomitant diagnoses, respectively. There was a significant association between advanced age and the existence of multiple diagnoses (P \u003C 0.001). With the exception of the ill-defined symptoms/signs/conditions, the two most frequent diagnoses were diseases of the circulatory system and diseases of the respiratory system in patients aged 65 years or older. On average, treatment-associated expenditure and drug-associated expenditure in Taiwan EDs averaged NT$1,155 ($35.0) and NT$190 ($5.8), respectively, which was equal to 64.5% and 10.6% of the total ED-associated cost. General ED medical expenditure increased with patient age; the increased cost ratio due to age was estimated at 8% per year (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of major health problems diagnosed at ED visits varied by age: more complicated complaints and multiple diagnoses were more frequent in older patients. In Taiwan, the ED system remains overloaded, possibly because of the low cost of an ED visit.","publish_time":"2009-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Nan-Ping; Lee, Yi-Hui; Lin, Ching-Heng; Chung, Yuan-Chang; Chen, Wen-Jone; Chou, Pesus","journal":"J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2000b147cb90354ba98206dffbc47deddddcc84d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3924095.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["EMS","National Health Insurance"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["ED system","ED visits","emergency medical system","General ED medical expenditure","frequent diagnoses","total ED-associated cost","patient age","advanced age","circulatory system","respiratory system","Taiwan EDs averaged NT","concomitant diagnoses","older patients","drug-associated expenditure","treatment-associated expenditure","existence of multiple diagnoses","diseases","low cost","emergency departments","increased cost ratio","years","emergency room","redistribution of national medical resources","National Health Insurance","representative database","frequency of major health problems","decisions","policymakers responsible","information","conditions","NHI","complicated complaints","diagnostic category","ill-defined symptoms","signs","majority of adults","significant association","METHODS","systematic sampling method","females","exception","CONCLUSIONS","poisoning","BACKGROUND","period","injury","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We administered a cross-sectional telephone survey to a representative sample (n = 443) of the Swedish adult population to examine whether self-reported intentions to improve personal hygiene and increase social distancing during influenza outbreaks could be explained by trust in official information, self-reported health (SF-8), sociodemographic factors, and determinants postulated in protection motivation theory, namely threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The interviewees were asked to make their appraisals for two scenarios: a) an influenza with low case fatality and mild lifestyle impact; b) severe influenza with high case fatality and serious disturbances of societal functions. Every second respondent (50.0%) reported high trust in official information about influenza. The proportion that reported intentions to take deliberate actions to improve personal hygiene during outbreaks ranged between 45\u201385%, while less than 25% said that they intended to increase social distancing. Multiple logistic regression models with coping appraisal as the explanatory factor most frequently contributing to the explanation of the variance in intentions showed strong discriminatory performance for staying home while not ill (mild outbreaks: Area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.82;0.89), severe outbreaks AUC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77;0.85)) and acceptable performance with regard to avoiding public transportation (AUC 0.78 (0.74;0.82), AUC 0.77 (0.72;0.82)), using handwash products (AUC 0.70 (0.65;0.75), AUC 0.76 (0.71;0.80)), and frequently washing hands (AUC 0.71 (0.66;0.76), AUC 0.75 (0.71;0.80)). We conclude that coping appraisal was the explanatory factor most frequently included in statistical models explaining self-reported intentions to carry out non-pharmaceutical health actions in the Swedish outlined context, and that variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite scientific uncertainties surrounding a recent mass vaccination campaign.","publish_time":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timpka, Toomas; Spreco, Armin; Gursky, Elin; Eriksson, Olle; Dahlstr\u00F6m, \u00D6rjan; Str\u00F6mgren, Magnus; Ekberg, Joakim; Pilemalm, Sofie; Karlsson, David; Hinkula, Jorma; Holm, Einar","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ec1c2c2244a8d8f5959fad54ba3b7923e72e971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3946657.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3946657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AUC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe outbreaks AUC","influenza outbreaks","self-reported intentions","coping appraisal","mild outbreaks","threat appraisal","self-reported health","severe influenza","statistical models","infectious disease outbreaks","high case fatality","high trust","personal hygiene","theoretical models of preparedness","official information","explanatory factor","social distancing","Multiple logistic regression models","low case fatality","non-pharmaceutical health actions","deliberate actions","public transportation","acceptable performance","mild lifestyle impact","Swedish outlined context","Swedish adult population","strong discriminatory performance","scientific uncertainties","variations","smaller role","SF","serious disturbances of societal functions","representative sample","determinants","recent mass vaccination campaign","attitudes","variance","regard","Area","protection motivation theory","cross-sectional telephone survey","weakness","strategies","curve","sociodemographic factors","beliefs","explanation","appraisals","Failure","confidence interval","scenarios","proportion","handwash products","interviewees","respondent","hands"],"language":"en"},

The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N- and O-linked glycans. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca(2\u002B)-dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)-dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency.","publish_time":"2014-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lennemann, Nicholas J.; Rhein, Bethany A.; Ndungo, Esther; Chandran, Kartik; Qiu, Xiangguo; Maury, Wendy","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79c0f8dbc31024ca3901227a97df7d35341d5229.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3950510.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3950510/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozcx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":["MLD","EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["independent of GP1 N-glycans","loss of GP1 N-linked glycans","N-linked glycan sites","N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1","conserved N-linked glycans","CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions","EBOV GP1 core","GP1 subunit","EBOV entry","glycan cap","O-linked glycans","glycan shield","GP structure","expression of GP","MLD enhanced antiserum","MLD domains mask RBD residues","dependent transduction","viral entry efficiency","antibody sensitivity","receptor-binding domain","enhanced pseudovirion transduction","antibody neutralization","glycosylated domains","endosomal receptor","protease sensitivity","murine peritoneal macrophages","lectin","negative impact","understanding","virion surface-associated glycoprotein","Vero cells","NPC1","evidence","role","C-type","results","mucin","increase","important primary cell","function","trimer of heterodimers","GP2","Ebola virus","mutagenesis","effects","removal","total","CLECs"],"language":"en"},

The damage caused by the disease and our treatments for the patients often leave them physically and cognitively debilitated. Generally, GBMs appear after very short clinical histories and are discovered by imaging (using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the diagnosis is validated by pathology, following surgical resection. The treatment response and diagnosis of tumor recurrence are also tracked by MRI, but there are numerous problems encountered with these monitoring modalities, such as ambiguous interpretation and forms of pseudoprogression. Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers would be an immense boon in following treatment schemes and in determining recurrence, which often requires an invasive intracranial biopsy to verify imaging data. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are stable, membrane-enclosed, virus-sized particles released from either the cell surface or from endosomal pathways that lead to the systemic release of EVs into accessible biofluids, such as serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. EVs carry a wide variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites, with many common features but with enough individuality to be able to identify the cell of origin of the vesicles. These components, if properly interrogated, could allow for the identification of tumor-derived EVs in biofluids, indicating tumor progression, relapse, or treatment failure. That knowledge would allow clinicians to continue with treatment regimens that were actually effective or to change course if the therapies were failing. Here, we review the features of GBM EVs, in terms of EV content and activities that may lead to the use of EVs as serially accessible biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in neuro-oncology.","publish_time":"2014-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Redzic, Jasmina S; Ung, Timothy H; Graner, Michael W","journal":"Pharmgenomics Pers Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bae24fa42f6bd7e9a241b4456296f3af0ee4b2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3952682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3952682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment response","derived EVs","use of EVs","features of GBM EVs","treatment regimens","treatment failure","systemic release of EVs","diagnosis of tumor recurrence","following treatment schemes","accessible biofluids","accessible biomarkers","tumor progression","identification of tumor","imaging data","MRI","patients","magnetic resonance imaging","predictive biomarkers","cell surface","cell of origin","common features","Extracellular vesicles","immense boon","primary central nervous system tumors","nucleic acids","wide variety of proteins","ambiguous interpretation","urine","monitoring modalities","virus-sized particles","plasma","membrane-enclosed","serum","terms of EV content","relapse","cerebrospinal fluid","endosomal pathways","invasive intracranial biopsy","lipids","activities","metabolites","numerous problems","short clinical histories","neuro-oncology","GBMs","forms of pseudoprogression","saliva","disease","individuality","Diagnostic","prognostic","pathology","clinicians","course","surgical resection","years postdiagnosis","Glioblastoma multiforme","treatments","therapies","components","damage","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

The Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) Schiff base compound demonstrated a potent antiproliferative effect in HT-29 cells, with an IC(50 )value of 2.87 \u03BCg/ml after 72 h of treatment. HT-29 cells treated with Cu (II) complexes underwent apoptosis death, as exhibited by a progressive elevation in the proportion of the G(1 ) cell population. At a concentration of 6.25 \u03BCg/ml, the Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) compound caused significant elevation in ROS production following perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, as assessed by the measurement of fluorescence intensity in stained cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 was part of the Cu (II) complex-induced apoptosis, which confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.

The encouraging results obtained by studying in vitro systems and model organisms have set the groundwork for what is likely to become an emerging field in the area of molecular and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the ability to isolate and expand from patients various types of muscle progenitor cells capable of committing to the myogenic lineage provides the opportunity to establish cell lines that can be used for transplantation following ex vivo manipulation and expansion.

In the present study, we directly compared MOG(35\u201355), MBP(35\u201347), and PLP(190\u2013209) models of EAE with our HSV-IL-2-induced MS model. Mice with HSV-IL-2-induced and MOG-induced demyelinating diseases demonstrated a similar pattern and distribution of demyelination in their brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In contrast, no demyelination was detected in the optic nerves of MBP- and PLP-injected mice. IFN-\u03B2 injections significantly reduced demyelination in brains of all groups, in the spinal cords of the MOG and MBP groups, and completely blocked it in the spinal cords of the PLP and HSV-IL-2 groups as well as in optic nerves of MOG and HSV-IL-2 groups.

Collectively, the results indicate that the HSV-IL-2 model and the MOG model complement each other and, together, provide unique insights into the heterogeneity of human MS.","publish_time":"2014-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dumitrascu, Oana M.; Mott, Kevin R.; Ghiasi, Homayon","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/943576d41ee9cd2a8be3379fa2ff1bc8963a3202.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4047154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4047154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MOG","PLP","EAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV-IL","IL-12p70","murine IL","MOG model","recombinant HSV","MOG-injected mice","optic nerves of MOG","MBP groups","reduced demyelination","distribution of demyelination","CNS demyelination","treatment groups","PLP-injected mice","induced MS model","optic nerves of MBP","spinal cords","different strains of mice","IFN-\u03B2 treatment","models of EAE","contrast","mouse models of multiple sclerosis","IFN-\u03B2 injections","clinical signs of paralysis","disease-related mortality","similar pattern","brains","ocular infection","demyelinating diseases","mixture of viral","unique insights","heterogeneity of human","immune triggers","present study","results"],"language":"en"},

Official indications for ECMO are unclear for immunocompromised and HIV-positive patients affected by severe hypoxemia. Uncertainties are related to prognosis and efficacy of treatment of the underlying disease. However, the care of patients with HIV infection has advanced since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with increased life expectancy and decreased mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: Three HIV-infected patients with AIDS were admitted to ICU and were treated with ECMO: a 21 years old Caucasian female with congenital HIV infection presented with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); a 38 years old Caucasian female with HIV-HCV infection and L. pneumophila pneumonia; a 24 years old Caucasian male with fever, cough weight loss and PJP pneumonia. Two patients were alive, with a good immunovirological profile and they went back to their previous quality of life. The last patient died with septic shock after three months of ICU stay. CONCLUSION: ECMO was effective in three HIV-positive patients with an otherwise fatal respiratory failure. All patients had severe immunosuppression and/or limited antiretroviral options. A multidisciplinary critical team is needed to individualize the use of ECMO in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV infection.","publish_time":"2014-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Fanelli, Vito; Corcione, Silvia; Urbino, Rosario; Bonetto, Chiara; Ricci, Davide; Rinaldi, Mauro; Di Perri, Giovanni; Bonora, Stefano; Ranieri, Marco V","journal":"BMC Anesthesiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d060ac88688f8137566e9b90ce2ac8fe0ef1878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4057620.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","ICU","PJP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV-positive patients","HIV-infected patients","immunocompromised patients","care of patients","congenital HIV infection","HIV-HCV infection","use of ECMO","years old Caucasian female","years old Caucasian male","PJP pneumonia","severe immunosuppression","pneumophila pneumonia","severe hypoxemia","Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia","increased life expectancy","previous quality of life","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","months of ICU","fatal respiratory failure","active antiretroviral therapy","limited antiretroviral options","fever","cough weight loss","HAART","bridging procedure","ARDS","introduction","efficacy of treatment","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","septic shock","decreased mortality","BACKGROUND","AIDS","Official indications","CASE PRESENTATION","good immunovirological profile","prognosis","underlying disease","multidisciplinary critical team","Uncertainties","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

After biosynthesis E protein forms a heterodimer with precursor membrane (prM) protein. Recent reports of infection enhancement by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest anti-prM responses could be potentially harmful. Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM antibodies, our findings provide new insights into the expression and secretion of E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein and contribute to future subunit vaccine design.","publish_time":"2014-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Szu-Chia; Tsai, Wen-Yang; Nerurkar, Vivek R.; Wang, Wei-Kung","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e10af65e4c33f25a580260de1b277ca738dcc886.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4065094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4065094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ectodomain of E protein","secretion of E protein ectodomain","absence of prM protein","full-length E protein","biosynthesis E protein","characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain","E proteins","particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4","anti-prM antibodies","anti-prM responses","anti-prM monoclonal antibodies","DENV type","ER membrane","precursor membrane","membrane association","enhancement of DENV infectivity","expression","mAbs","major target of neutralizing antibodies","glycosylation pattern","complex glycans","future subunit vaccine design","vaccine development","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","potential subunit immunogen","high mannose glycans","N-linked glycosylation","Recent reports of infection enhancement","terminal truncation constructs","heterodimer","presence","new insights","detergent","series of C","dengue virus","diameter","sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation","trans-Golgi","envelope","nm","treatment","form particles","study","SIGNIFICANCE","electron microscopy","Mutational analysis","ammonia chloride","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The knowledge that HIV-1 changes the host homeostatic equilibrium, which may favor the patient resistance to some co-pathogens, prompted us to investigate whether HIV-1 infection could influence A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle in vitro. We show here that exposure of A(H1N1)pdm09-infected epithelial cells to HIV-1 viral particles or its gp120 enhanced by 25% the IFITM3 content, resulting in a decrease in influenza replication. This event was dependent on toll-like receptor 2 and 4. Moreover, knockdown of IFITM3 prevented HIV-1 ability to inhibit A(H1N1)pdm09 replication. HIV-1 infection also increased IFITM3 levels in human primary macrophages by almost 100%. Consequently, the arrival of influenza ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to nucleus of macrophages was inhibited, as evaluated by different approaches. Reduction of influenza RNPs entry into the nucleus tolled A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle in macrophages earlier than usual, limiting influenza\u0027s ability to induce TNF-\u03B1. As judged by analysis of the influenza hemagglutin (HA) gene from in vitro experiments and from samples of HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals, the HIV-1-induced reduction of influenza replication resulted in delayed viral evolution. Our results may provide insights on the mechanisms that may have attenuated the clinical course of Influenza in HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected patients during the recent influenza form 2009/2010.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mesquita, Milene; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Abrantes, Juliana L.; Costa, Eduardo; Temerozo, Jairo R.; Siqueira, Marilda M.; Bou-Habib, Dumith Chequer; Souza, Thiago Moreno L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25b38d2f44283253d1e8d320c8389c069c5ae906.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4076258.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4076258/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1","pdm09 replication","samples of HIV","pdm09 co-infected patients","pdm09 co-infected individuals","infected patients co-infected","influenza hemagglutin","pdm09 life cycle","pdm09-infected epithelial cells","clinical course of Influenza","induced reduction of influenza replication","recent influenza form","Reduction of influenza RNPs entry","arrival of influenza ribonucleoproteins","nucleus of macrophages","co-pathogens","IFITM3 levels","IFITM3 content","knockdown of IFITM3","infection","human primary macrophages","nucleus tolled","viral particles","influenza\u0027s ability","delayed viral evolution","benign clinical outcome","gene","experiments","decrease","patient resistance","mechanisms","TNF-\u03B1","host homeostatic equilibrium","analysis","gp120","results","insights","event","receptor","exposure","different approaches","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: To study the possibility of the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to influenza viruses which underwent a major antigenic drift between the years 1999 and 2007 sera from samples of 80 children and 400 adults were selected at random from the Israeli national serum bank. The sera was obtained in 2002 and in 2007, two time points that followed a major drift in the infectious H3N2 influenza virus strain (A/Panama/2007/99 to A/Wisconsin/67/2005). RESULTS: In the summer of 2002, 13% of the children had Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) antibody titers of at least 40 and these antibodies recognized both A/Panama/2007/99 and A/Wisconsin/67/2005, where the latter strain only began to circulate in Israel in 2006. In 2007, 29% of the children had HI antibody titers of at least 40 directed against both A/Wisconsin/67/2005 and A/Panama/2007/99, even though they had never been exposed to the latter virus.

Human-to-human transmission has been documented, indicating that FTLSV should be considered a potential public health threat. Determining the historical spread of FTLSV could help curtail its spread and prevent future movement of this virus. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To examine the pattern of FTLSV evolution and the origin of outbreak strains, as well to examine the rate of evolution, the genome of 12 FTLSV strains were sequenced and a phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of all available FTLSV sequences in China were performed. Analysis based on the FTLSV L segment suggests that the virus likely originated somewhere in Huaiyangshan circa 1790 (95% highest probability density interval: 1756\u20131817) and began spreading around 1806 (95% highest probability density interval: 1773\u20131834). Analysis also indicates that when FTLSV arrived in Jiangsu province from Huaiyangshan, Jiangsu Province became another source for the spread of the disease. Bayesian factor test analysis identified three major transmission routes: Huaiyangshan to Jiangsu, Jiangsu to Liaoning, and Jiangsu to Shandong. The speed of FTLSV movement has increased in recent decades, likely facilitated by modern human activity and ecosystem changes. In addition, evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found in FTLSV; purifying selection appears to have been the dominant force in the evolution of this virus. CONCLUSION: Results presented in the manuscript suggest that the Huaiyangshan area is likely be the origin of FTLSV in China and identified probable viral migration routes. These results provide new insights into the origin and spread of FTLSV in China, and provide a foundation for future virological surveillance and control.","publish_time":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Xueyong; Liu, Licheng; Du, Yanhua; Wu, Weili; Wang, Haifeng; Su, Jia; Tang, Xiaoyan; Liu, Qi; Yang, Yinhui; Jiang, Yongqiang; Chen, Weijun; Xu, Bianli","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4199521.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4199521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Huaiyangshan","Jiangsu"],"keyphrases":["origin of FTLSV","FTLSV strains","historical spread of FTLSV","pattern of FTLSV evolution","speed of FTLSV movement","available FTLSV sequences","Jiangsu province","China","Huaiyangshan area","human transmission","Bayesian phylogeographic analysis","Henan Province","Bayesian factor test analysis","origin of outbreak strains","leukocytopenia syndrome virus","future movement","rate of evolution","highest probability density interval","Results","major transmission routes","modern human activity","future virological surveillance","probable viral migration routes","evidence of RNA segment reassortment","fever","thrombocytopenia","foundation","source","Liaoning","recent decades","control","addition","ecosystem changes","ticks","manuscript","genome","potential public health threat","novel bunyavirus","animals","Chinese provinces","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","dominant force","new insights","METHOD","CONCLUSION","disease","Shandong","selection","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Differences in susceptibility to goat plague among different breeds and water buffalo exist. The host innate immune system discriminates between pathogen associated molecular patterns and self antigens through surveillance receptors known as Toll like receptors (TLR). We investigated the role of TLR and cytokines in differential susceptibility of goat breeds and water buffalo to PPRV. We examined the replication of PPRV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Indian domestic goats and water buffalo and demonstrated that the levels of TLR3 and TLR7 and downstream signalling molecules correlation with susceptibility vs resistance. Naturally susceptible goat breeds, Barbari and Tellichery, had dampened innate immune responses to PPRV and increased viral loads with lower basal expression levels of TLR 3/7. Upon stimulation of PBMC with synthetic TLR3 and TLR7 agonists or PPRV, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were found to be significantly higher while immunosuppressive interleukin (IL) 10 levels were lower in PPRV resistant Kanni and Salem Black breeds and water buffalo at transcriptional level, correlating with reduced viralloads in infected PBMC. Water buffalo produced higher levels of interferon (IFN) \u03B1 in comparison with goats at transcriptional and translational levels. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with human IFN\u03B1 resulted in reduction of PPRV replication, confirming the role of IFN\u03B1 in limiting PPRV replication. Treatment with IRS66, a TLR7 antagonist, resulted in the reduction of IFN\u03B1 levels, with increased PPRV replication confirming the role of TLR7. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of TLR7 of these goat breeds did not show any marked nucleotide differences that might account for susceptibility vs resistance to PPRV. Analyzing other host genetic factors might provide further insights on susceptibility to PPRV and genetic polymorphisms in the host.","publish_time":"2014-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhanasekaran, Sakthivel; Biswas, Moanaro; Vignesh, Ambothi R.; Ramya, R.; Raj, Gopal Dhinakar; Tirumurugaan, Krishnaswamy G.; Raja, Angamuthu; Kataria, Ranjit S.; Parida, Satya; Subbiah, Elankumaran","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eba29203084de16f501b71b64873f5c96ce55f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4219731.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR","PPRV","PBMC","Salem Black"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of PPRV","increased PPRV replication","reduction of PPRV replication","water buffalo","levels of TLR3","PPRV resistant Kanni","differential susceptibility of goat breeds","reduction of IFN\u03B1 levels","translational levels","role of TLR7","susceptible goat breeds","goat plague","higher levels of interferon","levels of proinflammatory cytokines","different breeds","TLR7 agonists","susceptibility vs resistance","TLR7 antagonist","role of IFN\u03B1","lower basal expression levels of TLR","Salem Black breeds","human IFN\u03B1","Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of TLR7","infected PBMC","stimulation of PBMC","host genetic factors","increased viral loads","Indian domestic goats","innate immune responses","marked nucleotide differences","transcriptional level","surveillance receptors","synthetic TLR3","immune system","genetic polymorphisms","Pre-treatment of Vero cells","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","contagious viral disease of sheep","downstream signalling molecules correlation","molecular patterns","pathogen","Tellichery","self antigens","comparison","insights","reduced viralloads","Toll","Peste","Barbari","petits ruminants virus","immunosuppressive interleukin","IRS66","Ovine rinderpest"],"language":"en"},

Suppressing the level and transcriptional activity of cccDNA might have anti-HBV effect. Although cellular transcription factors, such as CREB, which mediate HBV transcription, have been well described, transcriptional coactivators that facilitate this process are incompletely understood. In this study we showed that CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) is required for HBV transcription and replication. The steady-state levels of CRTC1 protein were elevated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and liver tissues. Ectopic expression of CRTC1 or its homolog CRTC2 or CRTC3 in hepatoma cells stimulated the activity of the preS2/S promoter of HBV, whereas overexpression of a dominant inactive form of CRTC1 inhibited HBV transcription. CRTC1 interacts with CREB and they are mutually required for the recruitment to the preS2/S promoter on cccDNA and for the activation of HBV transcription. Accumulation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and cccDNA was observed when CRTC1 or its homologs were overexpressed, whereas the levels of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were diminished when CRTC1 was compromised. In addition, HBV transactivator protein HBx stabilized CRTC1 and promoted its activity on HBV transcription.

This noncanonical translation requires no AUG start codon and can initiate in multiple frames of CAG, CGG and GGGGCC repeats of the sense and antisense strands of disease-relevant transcripts. RNA structures formed by the repeats have been suggested as possible triggers; however, the precise mechanism of the translation initiation remains elusive. Templates containing expansions of microsatellites have also been shown to challenge translation elongation, as frameshifting has been recognized across CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington\u0027s disease. Determining the critical requirements for RAN translation and frameshifting is essential to decipher the mechanisms that govern these processes. The contribution of unusual translation products to pathogenesis needs to be better understood.

Nevertheless there are currently no publicly available transcriptome reference sequences or genome for this species. RESULTS: A cDNA library derived from mRNA and snRNA isolated and pooled from the brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, livers, and hearts of three adult female Syrian hamsters was sequenced. Sequence reads were assembled into 62,482 contigs and 111,796 reads remained unassembled (singletons). This combined contig/singleton dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, represents a total of 60,117,204 nucleotides. Our Mesocricetus auratus Syrian hamster transcriptome mapped to 11,648 mouse transcripts representing 9,562 distinct genes, and mapped to a similar number of transcripts and genes in the rat. We identified 214 quasi-complete transcripts based on mouse annotations. Canonical pathways involved in a broad spectrum of fundamental biological processes were significantly represented in the library. The Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned to the current release of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transcriptome and genome to improve the genomic annotation of this species. Finally, our Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned against 14 other rodents, primate and laurasiatheria species to gain insights about the genetic relatedness and placement of this species. CONCLUSIONS: This Syrian hamster transcriptome dataset significantly improves our knowledge of the Syrian hamster\u0027s transcriptome, especially towards its future use in infectious disease research. Moreover, this library is an important resource for the wider scientific community to help improve genome annotation of the Syrian hamster and other closely related species. Furthermore, these data provide the basis for development of expression microarrays that can be used in functional genomics studies.","publish_time":"2014-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tchitchek, Nicolas; Safronetz, David; Rasmussen, Angela L.; Martens, Craig; Virtaneva, Kimmo; Porcella, Stephen F.; Feldmann, Heinz; Ebihara, Hideki; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f11b19a9e1845ff5ab66a42d5409f8caed24faa1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4232415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232415/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Canonical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Syrian hamster transcriptome dataset","Mesocricetus auratus Syrian hamster transcriptome","Syrian hamster\u0027s transcriptome","golden hamster","cell transcriptome","Chinese hamster ovary","adult female Syrian hamsters","laurasiatheria species","related species","available transcriptome reference sequences","genome annotation","mouse transcripts","cDNA library","quasi-complete transcripts","similar number of transcripts","mouse annotations","singleton dataset","genomic annotation","distinct genes","Sequence reads","multiple pathogens","new experimental animal model","insights","importance","hearts","CHO","wider scientific community","knowledge","future use","emerging zoonotic diseases","current release","brains","kidneys","livers","broad spectrum of fundamental biological processes","important resource","snRNA isolated","genetic relatedness","basis","lungs","spleens","infectious disease research","mRNA","contigs","primate","placement","rodents","development of expression microarrays","total","CONCLUSIONS","Canonical pathways","Ebola","combined contig","BACKGROUND","functional genomics studies","singletons","RESULTS","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Twenty-three pathogenic respiratory agents, 18 respiratory viruses and five bacteria were investigated using multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF). Through IIF, 33 (20.4%) specimens with respiratory virus were recognised, with influenza virus representing over half of the positive samples. Through a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, 88 (54.3%) positive samples were detected; the most prevalent respiratory viral pathogens were influenza, human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Six cases of viral co-detection were observed, mainly involving RSV. The use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR increased the viral detection by 33.9% and revealed a larger number of respiratory viruses implicated in ARI cases, including the most recently described respiratory viruses [human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HCoV HKU1].","publish_time":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martins, Ronaldo Bragan\u00E7a; Carney, Sharon; Goldemberg, Daniel; Bonine, Lucas; Spano, Liliana Cruz; Siqueira, Marilda; Checon, Rita Elizabeth","journal":"Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b439deefbf5429abf9b27dc5bed6bee148c3dfa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4238762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4238762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARIs"],"organizations":["IIF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus","large range of respiratory viruses","larger number of respiratory viruses","pathogenic respiratory agents","influenza virus","prevalent respiratory viral pathogens","lower acute respiratory infections","viral detection","multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay","use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR","human rhinovirus","human coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","pdm09 virus","cases of viral co-detection","ARIs","specimens","RSV","positive samples","IIF","multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","sensitive molecular detection technique","HCoV HKU1","ARI cases","indirect immunofluorescence assay","H1N1","mortality of upper","outpatients","morbidity","NL63","bacteria","major contributors","frequencies","half","ages","age groups","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","individuals","study","aim"],"language":"en"},

This study examined 2851 cases of hepatitis B that were hospitalized in Shenzhen in 2010 and studied the spatial distribution, risk factors and spatial access to health services using spatial interpolation, Pearson correlation analysis and the improved two-step floating catchment area method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of hepatitis B, along with risk factors as well as spatial access to the regional medical resources, was uneven and mainly concentrated in the south and southwest of Shenzhen in 2010. In addition, the distribution characteristics of hepatitis B revealed a positive correlation between four types of service establishments and risk factors for the disease. The Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.566, 0.515, 0.626, 0.538 corresponding to bath centres, beauty salons, massage parlours and pedicure parlours (p \u003C 0.05). Additionally, the allocation of medical resources for hepatitis B is adequate, as most patients could be treated at nearby hospitals.","publish_time":"2014-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xi, Yuliang; Ren, Fu; Liang, Shi; Zhang, Jinghua; Lin, De-Nan","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/063f48cf2d9b53b075433f3bd1a63566feb240db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4245626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["spatial distribution of hepatitis B","spatial access","spatial information","spatial interpolation","risk factors","cases of hepatitis B","distribution characteristics of hepatitis B","high morbidity of hepatitis B","Pearson correlation analysis","positive correlation","Pearson correlation coefficients","regional medical resources","allocation of medical resources","patients","disease","Shenzhen","classic medical statistical analysis","massage parlours","pedicure parlours","health services","beauty salons","epidemiological studies","improved two-step floating catchment area method","China","types of service establishments","bath centres","study","autocorrelation","great help","addition","nearby hospitals","south","results"],"language":"en"},

The clinical presentation and laboratory parameters of febrile patients with a travel history to an endemic region were studied, and the role of the laboratory in the diagnosis was affirmed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Febrile patients presenting with clinical features defining dengue with a history of travel to an endemic area constituted the study group. Serum samples were tested for dengue-specific NS1 antigen and IgM, IgG antibodies. The demographic data were retrieved from the hospital information system. A hematological and biochemical workup was done and the results analyzed using percentage, proportion, mean, and median. RESULTS: Out of 189 febrile patients, 58 were reactive to serological tests for dengue, with 47 (81%) males. The presenting features were chills and rigors, myalgia, cough, sweating, and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia (74.35%), lymphopenia (52.94%), and leucopenia (47.05%) were present in early disease, with AST \u003E34 IU/L in 58.97% of the patients. The NS1 antigen was detectable between three and seven days of fever and the IgM antibodies after five days. The positivities to only NS1, both NS1 and IgM, and IgM alone were 60.34, 27.58, and 10.34%, respectively, and the median duration of fever was five, seven, and ten days, respectively. One case of dengue hemorrhagic fever and one of probable secondary dengue infection with detectable IgG were encountered. CONCLUSION: Dengue fever remains unsuspected in febrile cases in non-endemic regions. History of travel is an essential criterion to suspect dengue. A non-specific clinical presentation eludes diagnosis. Serological tests for antigen and antibodies, and hematological and biochemical markers are vital for distinguishing the diagnosis.","publish_time":"2014-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verma, Santwana; Kanga, Anil; Singh, Digvijay; Verma, Ghanshyam K; Mokta, Kiran; Ganju, Sunite A; Sharma, Vineeta","journal":"Adv Biomed Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4260275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4260275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IU/L"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrence of dengue fever","dengue-specific NS1 antigen","days of fever","case of dengue hemorrhagic fever","travel history","history of travel","IgM antibodies","diagnosis","probable secondary dengue infection","laboratory parameters of febrile patients","median duration of fever","febrile cases","IgG antibodies","endemic area","clinical features","non-endemic regions","non-endemic hilly region","detectable IgG","non-specific clinical presentation","serological tests","results","presenting features","biochemical markers","biochemical workup","rigors","association","cough","myalgia","chills","AST","sweating","METHODS","essential criterion","early disease","hospital information system","proportion","study group","role","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION","demographic data","Serum samples","IU","vomiting","percentage","positivities","Thrombocytopenia","lymphopenia","leucopenia","BACKGROUND","males"],"language":"en"},

Social distancing is an important component of behavioral response, though analyses have been limited by a lack of behavioral data. Our objective is to use media data to characterize social distancing behavior in order to empirically inform explanatory and predictive epidemiological models. METHODS: We use data on variation in home television viewing as a proxy for variation in time spent in the home and, by extension, contact. This behavioral proxy is imperfect but appealing since information on a rich and representative sample is collected using consistent techniques across time and most major cities. We study the April-May 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico and examine the dynamic behavioral response in aggregate and contrast the observed patterns of various demographic subgroups. We develop and calibrate a dynamic behavioral model of disease transmission informed by the proxy data on daily variation in contact rates and compare it to a standard (non-adaptive) model and a fixed effects model that crudely captures behavior. RESULTS: We find that after a demonstrable initial behavioral response (consistent with social distancing) at the onset of the outbreak, there was attenuation in the response before the conclusion of the public health intervention. We find substantial differences in the behavioral response across age subgroups and socioeconomic levels. We also find that the dynamic behavioral and fixed effects transmission models better account for variation in new confirmed cases, generate more stable estimates of the baseline rate of transmission over time and predict the number of new cases over a short horizon with substantially less error. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that A/H1N1 had an innate transmission potential greater than previously thought but this was masked by behavioral responses. Observed differences in behavioral response across demographic groups indicate a potential benefit from targeting social distancing outreach efforts.","publish_time":"2015-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Springborn, Michael; Chowell, Gerardo; MacLachlan, Matthew; Fenichel, Eli P","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92941695bf7be8f7cfeaecb5890acea82469f3fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4304633.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4304633/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central Mexico"],"keyphrases":["behavioral proxy","dynamic behavioral response","lack of behavioral data","important component of behavioral response","demonstrable initial behavioral response","individual behavioral responses","dynamic behavioral model of disease transmission","proxy data","social distancing behavior","time","daily variation","media data","social distancing outreach efforts","fixed effects model","fixed effects transmission models better account","baseline rate of transmission","innate transmission potential greater","H1N1","outbreak","RESULTS","new confirmed cases","number of new cases","observed patterns of various demographic subgroups","potential benefit","consistent techniques","demographic groups","age subgroups","contact rates","substantial differences","home television viewing","predictive epidemiological models","stable estimates","representative sample","information","order","Central Mexico","aggregate","short horizon","spread of flu","socioeconomic levels","standard","Theory","analyses","major cities","public health intervention","illnesses","BACKGROUND","attenuation","onset","error","objective","extension","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we applied an unbiased approach to understanding the functional role of signalling molecules in several models of normal physiological growth and translated these results to the biological understanding of breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: We developed and utilized a cytogenetically normal clonal line of hTERT immortalized human mammary epithelial cells in a fibroblast-enhanced co-culture assay to conduct a genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for evaluation of the functional effect of silencing each gene. Our selected endpoint was inhibition of growth. In rigorous postscreen validation processes, including quantitative RT-PCR, to ensure on-target silencing, deconvolution of pooled siRNAs and independent confirmation of effects with lentiviral short-hairpin RNA constructs, we identified a subset of genes required for mammary epithelial cell growth. Using three-dimensional Matrigel growth and differentiation assays and primary human mammary epithelial cell colony assays, we confirmed that these growth effects were not limited to the 184-hTERT cell line. We utilized the METABRIC dataset of 1,998 breast cancer patients to evaluate both the differential expression of these genes across breast cancer subtypes and their prognostic significance. RESULTS: We identified 47 genes that are critically important for fibroblast-enhanced mammary epithelial cell growth. This group was enriched for several axonal guidance molecules and G protein\u2013coupled receptors, as well as for the endothelin receptor PROCR. The majority of genes (43 of 47) identified in two dimensions were also required for three-dimensional growth, with HSD17B2, SNN and PROCR showing greater than tenfold reductions in acinar formation. Several genes, including PROCR and the neuronal pathfinding molecules EFNA4 and NTN1, were also required for proper differentiation and polarization in three-dimensional cultures. The 47 genes identified showed a significant nonrandom enrichment for differential expression among 10 molecular subtypes of breast cancer sampled from 1,998 patients. CD79A, SERPINH1, KCNJ5 and TMEM14C exhibited breast cancer subtype\u2013independent overall survival differences. CONCLUSION: Diverse transmembrane signals are required for mammary epithelial cell growth in two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions. Strikingly, we define novel roles for axonal pathfinding receptors and ligands and the endothelin receptor in both growth and differentiation.

However, no information on the performance of surviving pigs that were exposed to the PEDv as piglets is available. Here, a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) infection on growing pigs\u2019 performance, as indicated by mortality, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was performed using production records from weaned pigs in nursery and wean-to-finish sites from sow farms that became PEDv-infected between May 2013 and June 2014. Production records from the first batch of growing pigs weaned in infected flows after the PEDv outbreak (\u201Cinfected batches\u201D) were compared with those from pigs weaned within the previous 14 to 120 days (\u201Ccontrol batches\u201D). Performance records from infected and control batches, paired by flow, were compared using non-parametric paired tests. Mortality, ADG and FCR were significantly different in PEDv-positive (infected) compared with PEDv-negative (control) batches, with a mean increase of mortality and FCR of 11% and 0.5, respectively, and a decrease of ADG of 0.16 lb/day. Our results demonstrate a poorer performance of growing pigs weaned after a PEDv outbreak compared with those weaned within the previous 14-120 days, suggesting that in addition to the mortality induced by PEDv in suckling pigs, the disease also impairs the performance of surviving pig. These findings help to quantify the impact of PEDv infection in the US and, ultimately, contribute to efforts to quantify the cost-effectiveness of disease prevention and control measures.","publish_time":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alvarez, Julio; Sarradell, Javier; Morrison, Robert; Perez, Andres","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/241bbd33b32abf0cc6adb68b9c80381f0856cddd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4359118.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDv outbreak","PEDv-positive","PEDv-negative","impact of PEDv infection","weaned pigs","infected batches","performance of surviving pigs","Performance records","control batches","suckling pigs","poorer performance of growing pigs","batch of growing pigs","growing pigs\u2019 performance","FCR","infected flows","control measures","production records","mean increase of mortality","impact of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","sow farms","decrease of ADG","days","suckling piglets","average daily feed intake","average daily gain","cost-effectiveness of disease prevention","feed conversion ratio","US pork industry","non-parametric paired tests","ADFI","nursery","quantification","finish sites","retrospective cohort study","results","information","addition","efforts","findings"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this work was to screen human suspension cell lines for the capacity to support viral replication. As the first step, it was investigated whether poliovirus can replicate in such cell lines. Sabin poliovirus type 1 was serially passaged on five human cell lines, HL60, K562, KG1, THP-1, and U937. Sabin type 1 was capable of efficiently replicating in three cell lines (K562, KG1, and U937), yielding high viral titers after replication. Expression of CD155, the poliovirus receptor, did not explain susceptibility to replication, since all cell lines expressed CD155. Furthermore, we showed that passaged virus replicated more efficiently than parental virus in KG1 cells, yielding higher virus titers in the supernatant early after infection. Infection of cell lines at an MOI of 0.01 resulted in high viral titers in the supernatant at day 4. Infection of K562 with passaged Sabin type 1 in a bioreactor system yielded high viral titers in the supernatant. Altogether, these data suggest that K562, KG1, and U937 cell lines are useful for propagation of poliovirus.","publish_time":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oosterhoff, Dinja; van de Weerd, Gerard; van Eikenhorst, Gerco; de Gruijl, Tanja D.; van der Pol, Leo A.; Bakker, Wilfried A.

This animal breeds normally with no obvious defect in development. The IfitmDel animals exhibit a steady and significantly enhanced weight gain relative to wild-type controls beginning about three months of age and under normal feeding conditions. The increased weight corresponds with elevated fat mass, and in tolerance tests they are hyporesponsive to insulin but respond normally to glucose. Both young (4 mo) and older (12 mo) IfitmDel mice have enhanced levels of serum leptin suggesting a defect in leptin/leptin receptor signaling. Analysis of the gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus of IfitmDel animals, compared to WT, demonstrated an altered ratio of Pomc and Npy neuropeptide expression, which likely impairs the satiation response of the IfitmDel animal leading to an increased eating behavior. Also elevated in hypothalamus of IfitmDel mice were pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and reduced IL-10. Anatomical analysis of the hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry revealed that microglia exhibit an abnormal morphology in IfitmDel animals and respond abnormally to Poly:IC challenge. These abnormalities extend the phenotype of the IfitmDel mouse beyond abnormal responses to viral challenge to include a metabolic phenotype and weight gain. Further, this novel phenotype for the IfitmDel mouse could be related to abnormal neuropeptide production, inflammatory status and microglia status in the hypothalamus.","publish_time":"2015-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wee, Yin Shen; Weis, Janis J.; Gahring, Lorise C.; Rogers, Scott W.; Weis, John H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ed7b23c66b9c4ad156f37619f8b88bc1c1e996b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4391874.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4391874/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IfitmDel mouse","hypothalamus of IfitmDel animals","hypothalamus of IfitmDel mice","increased weight","enhanced weight","weight gain","inflammatory status","microglia status","abnormal neuropeptide production","Npy neuropeptide expression","abnormal responses","abnormal morphology","metabolic phenotype","leptin receptor","novel phenotype","pro-inflammatory cytokine expression","gene expression profiles","levels of serum leptin","viral challenge","obvious defect","animal breeds","IC challenge","Anatomical analysis","elevated fat mass","increased eating behavior","altered ratio of Pomc","months of age","tolerance","wild-type controls","reduced IL","immunohistochemistry","WT","Poly","normal feeding conditions","Ifitm genes","satiation response","insulin","LoxP deletion","hyporesponsive","development","abnormalities","glucose"],"language":"en"},

Most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable information about pollution levels and public response. METHODS: We mined a collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China\u2019s largest microblogging service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to air quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior or a health concern. RESULTS: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to .718 (n=74, P\u003C.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1% (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior and 19% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be taken to improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: We have found quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects. Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data, especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires expensive surveys or interviews.","publish_time":"2015-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shiliang; Paul, Michael J; Dredze, Mark","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4400579.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["Sina Weibo"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["related messages","health-related data","volume of pollution","health perceptions","messages relevant","existing air pollution surveillance data","health concern","air particle pollution rates","content of pollution","data filters","monitoring air quality trends","related public perceptions","mental health trends","utility of social media data sources","indicative of true particle pollution levels","message volume","value of Chinese social media","wide range of public health goals","English-language social media","public response","self-reported health effects","Sina Weibo","task of disease surveillance","reactive behavior","qualitative results","Chinese government","different filters","rich details","qualitative study","firsthand reports","behaviors","city","actionable information","China\u2019s largest microblogging service","Pearson correlation values","keyword matching","expensive surveys","sample","relevance","Recent studies","topic modeling","collection","sentiment","BACKGROUND","interviews","research","cities","reliability","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Influenza viruses have developed ways to evade the body\u0027s immune response using an antigenic variation known as antigenic shift (replacement of HA and NA antigens with novel subtypes from noninfluenza viruses) and drift (mutations within antibody-binding sites in HA and or NA). Because of new influenza viruses constantly emerging from antigenic shift and drift, new influenza vaccines are required each year. Human-to-human transmission of influenza occurs each winter and early spring through small-particle aerosols or droplets. The influenza virus attacks epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with the potential for secondary bacterial infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The symptoms of influenza infection include fever, headache, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract manifestations such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis are virtually indistinguishable from other viral infections. Children with certain comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease and severe neurologic impairment, are at higher risk of influenza-related complications. The most reliable test for influenza is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid antigen tests have lower sensitivity and specificity and are not reliable during periods of low influenza activity. Antiviral treatment with NA inhibitors can shorten the duration of fever, symptoms, and hospitalization, especially when started within 48 hours of influenza illness onset. Prevention of influenza through annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all children 6 months of age and older. The vaccines contain three or four influenza subtypes, chosen depending on the circulating strains.

Viruses can only replicate in living cells. For studies of the growth of viruses and for the production of virus components, it is, therefore, necessary to have access to cells cultivated in the laboratory. Cell cultures are also of dominating importance for the isolation of infectious agents in the diagnosis of virus infections. Cell cultures are established by the propagation of dispersed cells. In some cases, such cells may grow in suspension, but most often, they grow as a monolayer on the supporting material. Cultures established by cultivation of the cells that have been released from organ fragments are called primary cell cultures. The cells from a primary culture can be increased in number by passaging, which means that the cells are transferred from one cultivation vessel to another, where they are again allowed to form a monolayer.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wadell, G\u00F6ran","journal":"Textbook of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["living cells","primary cell cultures","propagation of dispersed cells","growth of viruses","results of cultivation","cultivation vessel","monolayer","primary culture","diagnosis of virus infections","production of virus components","isolation of infectious agents","dominating importance","organ fragments","process","number","access","chapter","supporting material","studies","passaging","laboratory","cases","suspension"],"language":"en"},

The combination of these two determines the population trend called fitness. Species interact by competition for resources (predation or symbiosis); individuals of the same species influence one another socially, and the individuals themselves may be composed of large numbers of specialized cells, all containing the same genetic information, that have to cooperate with one another for the organism they compose to survive and reproduce. Evolution is a dynamic self-organization process in which causal correlations between the performance of the process as a whole and its component subprocesses are not identifiable. In Darwinian evolution, selection is complemented by mutation. Mutation can be studied quantitatively if selection is excluded by restricting amplification to a single replication round. Mutation rates can be measured and is defined as the probability of incorporating a noncognate base per incorporation event. Many quantitative insights into the nature of evolution have been gained from studying the model system provided by Q\u03B2 replicase. For quantitative studies of natural selection under controlled conditions, amplification of RNA by Q\u03B2 replicase is still unsurpassed.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biebricher, Christof K.","journal":"Origin and Evolution of Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13bb5655021916a7b938a7cfdac4fdd6d6396615.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Q\u03B2 replicase","nature of evolution","Darwinian evolution","selection","individuals","Species","Mutation rates","amplification of RNA","quantitative studies of","quantitative insights","dynamic self-organization process","causal correlations","controlled conditions","noncognate base","competition","resources","predation","symbiosis","large numbers of specialized cells","components","survival","incorporation event","single replication round","performance","model system","population trend","prevailing environment","component subprocesses","fitness","Evolutionary success","viable offspring","phenotype","probability","genetic information","combination","organism"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiological occurrence of different virus diseases shows marked variations. These concern seasonal and geographical distribution, in addition to the occurrence of diseases in different ages, sexes, and races. The distribution of a disease in a population can also be determined by measurements of immunity to the infectious agent in different age groups, so called seroepidemiology. A prerequisite for such studies is that suitable serological methods are used and that samples are collected from a representative fraction of the population. In the beginning of an acute epidemic, it is particularly important to identify the causative agent. To understand the mechanisms of the spread of infections, three basic circumstances must be taken into consideration, namely, the reservoir and source of infection, the transmission from this source, and the availability of susceptible hosts.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F6ttiger, Margareta; Norrby, Erling","journal":"Textbook of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173608.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173608/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrence of diseases","epidemiological occurrence of different virus diseases","different ages","epidemiology of virus diseases","population","different age groups","infectious agent","source of infection","geographical distribution","causative agent","addition","marked variations","spread of infections","studies","samples","basic circumstances","suitable serological methods","measurements of immunity","sexes","concern seasonal","acute epidemic","consideration","representative fraction","reservoir","races","seroepidemiology","transmission","chapter","availability of susceptible hosts","beginning","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

A wide variety of transporter proteins are expressed in apical and basolateral membranes and collectively play complex interactive roles in controlling the entire organism\u2019s overall metabolism of amino acids.

The next frontier for workers in this field is to uncover a comprehensive molecular understanding of the manner by which epithelial cells signal gene expression of transporters as triggered by substrates, hormones or other triggers, in order to further understand the trafficking and interactions among multimeric transport system proteins, to extend discoveries of novel small drug substrates for oral and ocular delivery, and to examine gene therapy or nanotherapy of diseases using small molecules delivered via amino acid transporters.","publish_time":"2009-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stevens, Bruce R.","journal":"Epithelial Transport Physiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a895411134bdd82a7f0333ef01128dc836da42f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amino acid transporters","gene expression of transporters","current view of amino acid transport","interactions","gene therapy","gene splicing","transport systems","specific spatial distribution of transporters","multimeric transport system proteins","entire organism\u2019s overall metabolism of amino acids","epithelial cells of vertebrates","small molecules","promoter regulation","discoveries of novel small drug substrates","selective tissue distribution","wide variety of transporter proteins","requisite subunits of oligomers","thermodynamic electrochemical gradients","ion exchangers","substrate specificity","ocular delivery","manner","net vectorial flow","complex interactive roles","nanotherapy of diseases","basolateral membranes","trafficking","field","comprehensive molecular understanding","levels","hormones","order","triggers","review","frontier","workers"],"language":"en"},

Incidences ranging from 2 to 24% have been reported, which might reflect different autopsy policies amongst centres. Recent studies have shown that many patients with invasive aspergillosis do not have a haematological diagnosis. Instead, conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver failure became recognized as important risk factors. The diagnosis remains difficult in these patients, since diagnostic tests have not been widely validated outside the haematological boundaries. Mechanical ventilation precludes the interpretation of clinical signs and radiological diagnosis is clouded by underlying lung pathology. Respiratory cultures lack sensitivity and specificity. At the moment, diagnosis is best made by testing for galactomannan in bronchoalveolar fluid samples (sensitivity and specificity of \u003E 87%).

The chapter will begin by describing the incidence and pathophysiologic significance of anemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) providing a differential diagnosis of the many conditions that may present with anemia in this setting. The chapter will next consider disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) focusing on the pathophysiology of a condition that has been associated with much morbidity and mortality. The underlying conditions predisposing to DIC will be detailed as well as a number of treatment options that have been implemented in clinical trials. In addition to DIC, thrombocytopenia may be caused by a number of other clinical conditions important to the pediatric critical care provider. The clinical and prognostic significance of thrombocytopenia will be addressed and a focused differential diagnosis will be provided. Thrombotic disorders are becoming increasingly recognized in children and are a particular concern for the pediatric intensivist. The epidemiology of thromboembolism in children will be reviewed focusing on the conditions most commonly associated with these thromboses. Finally, a chapter on hematologic issues in the critically ill child would not be complete without a discussion of sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome, one of the most frequent complications of sickle cell disease resulting in the need for intensive care services, will be discussed in detail.","publish_time":"2011-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brand\u00E3o, Leonardo R.; Howard, Scott C.; Gow, Kenneth W.; Rajasekaran, Surender; Tamburro, Robert F.","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Study Guide","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5260a71df26d9c28551f04bdf43fabf540beb9ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178863.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178863/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","clinical conditions important","underlying conditions","DIC","multicenter clinical trials","pediatric intensive care unit","ill children","intensive care services","pediatric critical care provider","pediatric intensivist","pathophysiology","discussion of sickle cell disease","pathophysiologic significance of anemia","prognostic significance of thrombocytopenia","focused differential diagnosis","frequent complications of sickle cell disease","variety of hematologic issues pertinent","number of treatment options","need","PICU","new therapeutic strategies","particular concern","incidence","improved understanding","area of intense research","intravascular coagulation","Acute chest syndrome","epidemiology of thromboembolism","addition","Thrombotic disorders","morbidity","mortality","setting"],"language":"en"},

This is especially true in a world with unprecedented international mobility of goods and persons. Moreover, particularly public health actions in the field of infectious diseases within one country may well affect public health issues in other countries. One of the best recent examples is the Chinese management of the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, which was characterised by failing surveillance structures, insufficient control measures and restricted public information policy. Abba Ebban has described it as a paradox that in order for countries to effectively execute their public health sovereignty, they would consequently have to give up some of their sovereignty to intergovernmental organisations (Ebban 1995).","publish_time":"2009-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krause, G\u00E9rard","journal":"Modern Infectious Disease Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1150e7889af0ad67829c86c0dad2a0b85394dee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Abba Ebban"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health sovereignty","public health policy","public health actions","public health issues","sovereignty of countries","restricted public information policy","health-care system","principle of national sovereignty","national borders","field of infectious diseases","typical domain of national","spread of infectious diseases","local governments","surveillance structures","government structures","Abba Ebban","account local necessities","insufficient control measures","Chinese management","epidemiologic situation","country","unprecedented international mobility of goods","initial phase","world","best recent examples","persons","SARS epidemic","paradox","intergovernmental organisations","theory"],"language":"en"},

The authors show that these concepts support the conclusion that learners are ethically obligated to accept reasonable, but not unreasonable, risk. Based on this ethical framework, the authors provide an account of the process of teaching professional formation that medical educators and academic leaders should implement. Medical educators and academic leaders should embrace the opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic presents for teaching professional formation. Learners should acquire the conceptual vocabulary of professional formation. Learners should recognize that risk of infection from patients is unavoidable. Learners should become aware of established ethical standards for professional responsibility during epidemics from the history of medicine. Learners should master understandable fear. Medical educators and academic leaders should ensure that didactic teaching of professional formation continues when it becomes justified to end learners\u2019 participation in the processes of patient care; topics should include the professionally responsible management of scarce medical resources.

SUMMARY: Demonstration of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli\u2010strains and rotaviruses in faecal samples from calves with diarrhoea Faecal samples collected from 100 neonatal calves with diarrhoea of variable duration all contained E. coli bacteria. Rotaviruses were demonstrated in 40 samples at the same time. The isolated E. coli strains were tested for their ability to produce enterotoxin by using the intestinal ligature test, and for the presence of O and K (pili) antigens by employing slide agglutination and haemagglutination techniques. 54 E. coli strains regularly produced enterotoxin, 37 of these 54 strains contained K 99 antigens, 42 strains showed a mannose\u2010resistent haemagglutination of horse red blood cells. The number of rotavirus\u2010positive samples in the enterotoxin\u2010producing group was 23 (43%); of the 63 K 99\u2010negative strains, 17 produced enterotoxin regularly and 36 produced it irregularly, 5 strains showed a mannose\u2010resistent haemagglutination. 25 samples were positive for rotavirus (40%). 0 group 106 dominated within the enteropathogenic E. coli strains.

Recent progress in the elucidation of the molecular functions of a growing list of NSs proteins highlights the astonishing variety of strategies employed by phleboviruses to evade the IFN system.","publish_time":"2016-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wuerth, Jennifer Deborah; Weber, Friedemann","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/441656e0f7eea90edc2e3cb7e72d362b55e97ce3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4926194.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4926194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Toscana virus","Heartland virus","sandfly fever Sicilian virus","sandfly fever Naples virus","Rift Valley fever virus","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","Punta Toro virus","number of emerging virus species","new members severe fever","NSs acts","IFN system","nonstructural protein NSs","prominent members","growing list of NSs proteins","RVFV","SFNV","SFTSV","SFSV","antiviral type","threat","TOSV","family Bunyaviridae","main phleboviral virulence factor","molecular functions","astonishing variety of strategies","antagonist","phleboviruses","interferon","mammalian host","elucidation"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the prevention/inhibition of AD may require vaccine/s targeting A\u03B2 and tau simultaneously or sequentially. Since high antibody titers are required for AD vaccine efficacy, we have decided to generate vaccines, targeting A\u03B2 (AV-1959R), Tau (AV-1980R) or A\u03B2/tau (AV-1953R) B cell epitopes, based on immunogenic MultiTEP platform and evaluate the immunogenicity of these vaccines formulated with Advax(CpG), delta inulin, Alhydrogel(\u00AE), Montanide-ISA51, Montanide-ISA720, MPLA-SM pharmaceutical grade adjuvants. Formulation of AV-1959R in Advax(CpG) induced the highest cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. The dual-epitope vaccine, AV-1953R, or the combination of AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines formulated with Advax(CpG) induced robust antibody responses against various forms of both, A\u03B2 and tau pathological molecules. While anti-A\u03B2 antibody titers after AV-1953R immunization were similar to that in mice vaccinated with AV-1959R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination, anti-tau titers were significantly lower after AV-1953R injection when compared to the AV-1980R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R. In silico 3D-modeling provided insight into the differences in immunogenicity of these vaccine constructs. In sum, AV-1959R and AV-1980R formulated with Advax(CpG) adjuvant were identified as promising immunogenic vaccines for ongoing pre-clinical assessment and future human clinical trials.","publish_time":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davtyan, Hayk; Zagorski, Karen; Rajapaksha, Harinda; Hovakimyan, Armine; Davtyan, Arpine; Petrushina, Irina; Kazarian, Konstantin; Cribbs, David H.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Agadjanyan, Michael G.; Ghochikyan, Anahit","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ad6fe3d0031f1dffb84dec640ac0bb7c5ba84fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4929459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4929459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R vaccines","combination of AV","R combination","Formulation of AV","R immunization","R injection","CpG","Advax","anti-tau titers","anti-A\u03B2 antibody titers","AD vaccine efficacy","tau pathological molecules","s targeting A\u03B2","AD patients","accumulation of pathological tau correlates","inhibition of AD","vaccine constructs","promising immunogenic vaccines","high antibody titers","robust antibody responses","immunogenicity","mice","dual-epitope vaccine","Montanide-ISA720","Montanide-ISA51","immunogenic MultiTEP platform","humoral immune responses","ongoing pre-clinical assessment","future human clinical trials","pathology","dementia","B cell epitopes","MPLA-SM pharmaceutical grade adjuvants","various forms","primary driver of Alzheimer\u2019s disease","insight","differences","Alhydrogel","delta inulin","D-modeling","silico","prevention","\u03B2-amyloid","sum"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies investigating community\u2010level relationships between plant functional trait characteristics and stream environmental characteristics remain scarce. Here, we used community\u2010weighted means to identify how plant traits link to lowland stream typology and how agricultural intensity in the catchment affects trait composition. 2. We analysed plant trait characteristics in 772 European lowland streams to test the following two hypotheses: (i) trait characteristics differ between plant communities in small and medium\u2010sized streams, reflecting adaptations to different habitat characteristics, and (ii) trait characteristics vary with the intensity of agricultural land use in the stream catchment, mediated either directly by an increase in productive species or indirectly by an increase in species that efficiently intercept and utilize light. 3. We found that the communities in small streams were characterized by a higher abundance of light\u2010demanding species growing from single apical meristems, reproducing by seeds and rooted to the bottom with floating and/or heterophyllous leaves, whereas the community in medium\u2010sized streams was characterized by a higher abundance of productive species growing from multi\u2010apical and basal growth meristems forming large canopies. 4. We also found indications that community trait characteristics were affected by eutrophication. We did not find enhanced abundance of productive species with an increasing proportion of agriculture in the catchments. Instead, we found an increase in the abundance of species growing from apical and multi\u2010apical growth meristems as well as in the abundance of species tolerant of low light availability. The increase in the abundance of species possessing these traits likely reflects different strategies to obtain greater efficiency in light interception and utilization in nutrient\u2010enriched environments. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings challenge the general assumption of the EU Water Framework Directive compliant assessment systems that plant community patterns in streams reflect the nutrient preference of the community. Instead, light availability and the ability to improve interception and utilization appeared to be of key importance for community composition in agricultural lowland streams. We therefore suggest moving from existing approaches building on species\u2010specific preference values for nutrients to determine the level of nutrient impairment to trait\u2010based approaches that provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the changes. We recommend that existing systems are critically appraised in the context of the findings of this study.","publish_time":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baattrup\u2010Pedersen, Annette; G\u00F6the, Emma; Larsen, S\u00F8ren E.; O\u0027Hare, Matthew; Birk, Sebastian; Riis, Tenna; Friberg, Nikolai","journal":"J Appl Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6a4e717f7accc1cbf1005f8d25bbb4df66c47cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU Water Framework Directive"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community trait characteristics","plant trait characteristics","plant functional trait characteristics","higher abundance of productive species","demanding species","trait composition","community composition","enhanced abundance of productive species","higher abundance of light","agricultural lowland streams","sized streams","small streams","community patterns","increase","abundance of species tolerant of low light availability","stream environmental characteristics","plant communities","light interception","European lowland streams","different habitat characteristics","multi\u2010apical growth meristems","single apical meristems","plant traits link","agricultural intensity","stream catchment","nutrient preference","lowland stream typology","level of nutrient impairment","utilization","basal growth meristems","existing systems","existing approaches","findings","intensity of agricultural land use","level relationships","different strategies","based approaches","species\u2010specific preference values","EU Water Framework Directive compliant assessment systems","reflecting adaptations","greater efficiency","general assumption","key importance","insight","nutrients","increasing proportion of agriculture","large canopies","weighted means","Previous studies","hypotheses","biological mechanisms","heterophyllous leaves","enriched environments","catchments","context","seeds","indications","eutrophication","changes","study","Synthesis","applications"],"language":"en"},

The data from these field studies were then used to generate microbial release rates from the biosolids for use in modeling bioaerosol transport. Continuous\u2010point sources represented by large biosolid piles (temporary storage before placement) in the field, and continuous\u2010area sources represented by large fields upon which biosolids were placed by spraying, were modeled using microbial transport models; and downwind microbial concentrations were generated. These quantified transport data were then entered into microbial dose\u2010response models in an attempt to characterize the risk of pathogenic bacteria and viruses infecting workers and nearby population centers. The risk of viral and bacterial infection to workers at biosolid land application sites is 3:100 and 2:100, respectively, under 2\u2010m/s wind conditions and 1 hr of exposure. The route of exposure proposed in this model is the transport, inhalation, deposition, and swallowing of bacterial or viral pathogens. Note that these risk models by nature would tend to overestimate the actual risk to populations (wastewater workers) consisting primarily of immunocompetent individuals. Under these low\u2010wind conditions, nearby population centers where such immunocompetent populations may exist (here considered to be 10 000 m from the land application sites) are predicted to be at little risk (1.95 \u00D7 10(\u2212):100) of infection from aerosolized bacteria and at no risk from aerosolized viruses.","publish_time":"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dowd, Scot E.; Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.; Pillai, Suresh D.","journal":"J Environ Qual","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk models","risk of viral","microbial transport models","actual risk","little risk","risk of pathogenic bacteria","microbial dose","land placement","biosolid land application sites","field site","field studies","field study","quantified transport data","wastewater workers","nearby population centers","large biosolid piles","biosolids","downwind microbial concentrations","microbial release rates","bacterial infection","modeling bioaerosol transport","response models","immunocompetent populations","aerosolized bacteria","aerosolized viruses","s wind conditions","large fields","area sources","de\u2010watered biosolid material","hr of exposure","immunocompetent individuals","viral pathogens","route of exposure","temporary storage","attempt","bioaerosols","inhalation","deposition","nature","spraying"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, bioavailability varies with IFN species and mode of administration, and all IFN species are potentially immunogenic. Assays for antiviral activity (IFN) and antiviral neutralization (antibodies, NAb) have been used for some time to monitor patients on IFN biologicals. These assays require laborious titrations making them unsuitable for large\u2010scale clinical use. Myxovirus A (MxA) is a resistance GTP\u2010binding protein that is specifically induced by treatment with type 1 IFNs. For example, IFN\u2010\u03B2\u2010induced MxA in blood leucocytes has been used as a biomarker in IFN\u2010\u03B2\u2010treated patients with multiple sclerosis. However, the degree of specificity of MxA in this regard is unclear, and measurements of MxA protein and/or mRNA are not yet suitable for routine clinical use. In an attempt to find new and better reporter genes (and, hopefully, genes and gene products with proven specificity for IFN\u2010\u03B1 and \u2010\u03B2), microarray screenings with U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix) were carried using human blood leucocytes and the human lung carcinoma cell line A549.

This stimulation has previously been shown to activate NK cells. Cell cytotoxicity was measured by flow cytometry after incubation with k562 cells. This method was compared to the current standard 51Cr release assay. Cells were treated with BFA to accumulate IFN\u2010\u03B3, stained for surface markers, permeabilized and stained for intracellular IFN\u2010\u03B3.

A candidate autoantigen, myelin basic protein (MBP), has especially attracted attention. The presence of anti\u2010MBP antibodies is a predictor of definite MS, but their role in the pathogenesis remains obscure. T cells have long been known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MS. Recently, an important role for B cells as autoantigen\u2010presenting cells has been demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The uptake of MBP by B cells and the presentation of MBP\u2010derive peptides to T helper (Th) cells by B cells may be promoted by the formation of complement (C) activating immune complexes (ICs) between MBP and natural autoantibodies in healthy individuals and disease\u2010associated anti\u2010MBP antibodies in MS patients, respectively. We have investigated the formation of MBP\u2010containing IC, the binding of MBP to B cells, the MBP\u2010elicited induction of Th\u2010cell and B\u2010cell proliferation and the cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors grown in the presence of intact or C\u2010inactivated serum from healthy donors or patients with MS. While MBP did not induce measurable proliferation of B cells nor CD4(\u002B) T cells, we observed the production of TNF\u2010\u03B1, IFN\u2010\u03B3 and IL\u201010 by PBMC in response to incubation with MBP in the presence of sera from healthy controls as well as sera from MS patients. By contrast, no production of IL\u20102, IL\u20104 and IL\u20105 was detected. We are currently investigating the capability of MS sera to promote the formation of MBP\u2010containing IC and thereby enhance the cytokine responses, by virtue of elevated anti\u2010MBP contents.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedegaard, C.

In this study, we aimed at analyzing the viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ARTI in hospitalized children admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. METHODS: Cohort of 386 hospitalized children (31 days to 15 years) diagnosed with ARTI admitted to the Department of Pediatrics from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples on the day of hospitalization were tested for 11 viruses via a GeXP\u2010based multiplex\u2010PCR assay. The viral profiles and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall positive rate of the samples was 43.26% (167/386). Among the 167 positive samples, 134 (80.24%, 134/167) had a single virus and 33 (19.76%, 33/167) had multiple viruses. There was a significant difference in the frequency of single vs mixed infections among positive samples (80.24% vs 19.76%; \u03C7 (2) = 122.168, P = .000) as well as among the total examined samples (34.72% vs 8.55%; \u03C7 (2) = 77.945, P = .000). Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (17.36%, 67/386), followed by influenza A (5.96%, 23/386) and human adenovirus (5.70%, 22/386). There was no significant difference in the etiological distribution of viral pathogens between males and females (\u03C7 (2) = 0.480, P = .489). Viral infections were more likely to occur in the winter\u2010spring months than in the summer\u2010autumn months (52.51% vs 33.53%, \u03C7 (2) = 13.830, P = .000). CONCLUSIONS: The GeXP\u2010based multiplex PCR is an accurate and high\u2010throughput assay allows us to quickly detect multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously in pediatric patients. Our study provides information on the viral profiles and clinical characteristics in hospitalized children with ARTI, which would help better effective prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Huanhuan; Chen, Suqing; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Hong, Linliang; Zeng, Yongbin; Wu, Bin","journal":"J Clin Lab Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec188aa1a3c988bd70b3909b2bc2de064bfea773.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171304.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized children","clinical characteristics of ARTI","viral epidemiology","viral profiles","Viral infections","positive samples","sputum samples","study","multiple viruses","multiple respiratory viruses","total examined samples","etiological distribution of viral pathogens","frequency of single vs mixed infections","multiplex PCR","information","PCR assay","GeXP","based multiplex","significant difference","single virus","overall positive rate","central Fujian","autumn months","throughput assay","spring months","Human rhinovirus","prevalent virus","human adenovirus","acute respiratory tract infection","Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University","summer","day of hospitalization","pediatric patients","females","better effective prevention strategies","Nasopharyngeal swab","winter","RESULTS","years","days","METHODS","Cohort","BACKGROUND","Department of Pediatrics","CONCLUSIONS","influenza"],"language":"en"},

Illus. 1962.\u2014Chromosome numbers for 39 taxa of Hedyotis separable into the subgenera Edrisia (Raf.) Lewis and Oldenlandia (L.) T. \u0026 G. are reported. The occurrence of basic numbers of x = 6, 7, 8, 9(10), 11, and 13, including infraspecific aneuploidy in H. nigricans (Lam.) Fosb., illustrates the importance of aneuploidy in the speciation of Hedyotis in contrast to most rubiaceous genera. In the North American subg. Edrisia, 25 species are ranked according to primitive and advanced expressions for 13 characters. It is postulated on the basis of these, ecologic, geographic, and chromosomal data that the x = 11 group gave rise to the x = 13 line by the gain of chromosomes and to the x = (10)9, 8, and 7 groups by reduction. Those species with a basic number of 6 are thought to have an Asian origin. Although aneuploidy has been dominant in the evolution of subg. Edrisia, only 12% of the species are polyploids. The development of polyploid races in 3 species, H. caerulea (L.) Hook., H. polypremoides (Gray) Shinners, and H. purpurea (L.) T. \u0026 G., however, suggests a greater role of polyploidy in the current evolution of Hedyotis.","publish_time":"1962-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewis, Walter H.","journal":"Am J Bot","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46bdce9d3172b4679e80e4f4837ec2acd6670550.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis","Walter H.","Stephen F.

In fact, the evidence that a genetic program existed for physiologic cell death came from the developmental studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.2 As time has progressed, however, apoptotic cell death has been shown to occur in many cell types under a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. Cells dying by apoptosis exhibit several characteristic morphologic features that include cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, nuclear and cellular fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, and eventual phagocytosis of the fragmented cell (Figure 4.1).","publish_time":"2010-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saikumar, Pothana; Kar, Rekha","journal":"Molecular Pathology of Lung Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8f4f066bdb09acb493ebf38b043d9e12f8355f3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["physiologic cell death","apoptotic cell death","cell shrinkage","fragmented cell","type of cell death","cell types","programmed cell death","control of cell numbers","characteristic morphologic features","membrane blebbing","nuclear condensation","variety of physiologic","apoptotic bodies","damaged cells","term apoptosis","cellular fragmentation","developmental studies","morphogenesis","important role","eventual phagocytosis","genetic program","nematode Caenorhabditis elegans","removal of infected","time","multicellular organisms","evidence","pathologic conditions","Figure","necrosis","fact","Kerr"],"language":"en"},

To perform relation extraction, our deep learning system, BiOnt, employs four types of biomedical ontologies, namely, the Gene Ontology, the Human Phenotype Ontology, the Human Disease Ontology, and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, regarding gene-products, phenotypes, diseases, and chemical compounds, respectively. We tested our system with three data sets that represent three different types of relations of biomedical entities. BiOnt achieved, in F-score, an improvement of 4.93% points for drug-drug interactions (DDI corpus), 4.99% points for phenotype-gene relations (PGR corpus), and 2.21% points for chemical-induced disease relations (BC5CDR corpus), relatively to the state-of-the-art.

These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality, and efficacy. In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response. To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly. Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response. Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety.","publish_time":"2016-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, M.D.; Al-Humadi, N.H.","journal":"A Comprehensive Guide to Toxicology in Nonclinical Drug Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1e1acdc533c94bfc231cff34162c0bebbf2113e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161388.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of new vaccines","safety pharmacology","evaluation of vaccine safety","critical characteristics of vaccine safety","final safety decision","Successful preclinical toxicology studies","clinical studies","different types of preclinical toxicology study","effective immune response","appropriate study designs","multiple factors","mutagenicity","repeat dose","right animal model","various adjuvants","carcinogenicity","significant role","addition","antigenic components","purity","potency","assays","recombinant forms","course","quality","identity","requirements","attenuated organisms","Immunity","infectious diseases","adverse effects","efficacy","initiation"],"language":"en"},

A small group of bacteria appear to predominate in ABRS, and these bacteria are empirically susceptible to tetracycline antibiotics, barring the presence of resistant strains. Historically, clinicians have mixed tetracycline with various biomaterials or hydrated biomaterials in a dilute tetracycline solution in the treatment of periodontal disease and for ridge preservation/augmentation indications. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case, a 39\u2010year\u2010old African\u2010American male with sinus graft infection and signs and symptoms consistent with ABRS was successfully treated by removing the initial graft material, thoroughly debriding and irrigating the antrum, and placing a freeze\u2010dried bone allograft hydrated in an aqueous tetracycline solution. CONCLUSION: Given the typical bacteria present in ABRS, locally applied tetracycline may be useful prophylactically in sinus elevation surgery or as an adjunct in managing postoperative sinus graft infection.","publish_time":"2018-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Thomas M.; Lincicum, Adam R.","journal":"Clin Adv Periodontics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91f606f197591d0d9a6a2bcaa6379f19f0533804.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ABRS","postoperative sinus graft infection","tetracycline antibiotics","mixed tetracycline","applied tetracycline","sinus augmentation surgery","dilute tetracycline solution","aqueous tetracycline solution","sinus elevation surgery","hydrated biomaterials","present case","typical bacteria present","initial graft material","small group of bacteria","various biomaterials","postoperative period","augmentation indications","CASE PRESENTATION","consequent acute bacterial rhinosinusitis","signs","adjunct","American male","treatment of periodontal disease","year\u2010old African","ridge preservation","symptoms consistent","freeze\u2010dried bone allograft","clinicians","INTRODUCTION","presence of resistant strains","CONCLUSION","complication","antrum"],"language":"en"},

However, this tentative optimism has been dashed by the current disruption. \u2580 While the near\u2010term impact of the virus is uncertain, the disruption to China will clearly be significant in Q1 \u2013 we expect Chinese GDP growth to plunge to just 3.8% y/y. Even though growth there will rebound in Q2 and Q3, it will take time for the loss in activity to be fully recovered and we now expect GDP growth of just 5.4% for 2020 as a whole, a downward revision of 0.6pp from last month. \u2580 Weaker Chinese imports and tourism and disruption to global supply chains will take a toll on the rest of the world, particularly in the Asia\u2010Pacific region. And the shock will exacerbate the ongoing slowdown in the US and may result in the eurozone barely expanding for a second quarter running in Q1. \u2580 Weaker oil demand in the short term has prompted us to lower our Brent oil price forecast.

Non\u2014centered principal component analysis plus varimax rotation (nodal component analysis) is applied to overstory and understory data in order to detect vegetational noda. The overstory data are inherently more structured (i.e., contain more distinct subgroups) than those of the understory. An exception is seen with groups in which Abies balsamea plays a prominent role. These are interpreted as stages in various successions of which only one, a Betula papyrifera to A. balsamea sequence, represents the complete transition from one canopy dominant to another. The understory noda are summarized in terms of the compositional and environmental features of stands belonging to each nodum. Relationships among the understory noda are summarized in a multidimensional scaling ordination which is derived directly from similarity values (conjunction coefficients) representing the overlap between pairs of noda. Two major environmental gradients seem to affect understory composition. These are a site moisture\u2014nutrient concentration gradient and a general fertility\u2014productivity gradient. Canopy composition and understory vegetation are compared by nodal conjunction between the two analyses. Groups of noda, representing wet bog forests and also upland mesic forests, show moderate to good coincidence but beyond this little canopy specificity emerges. These results indicate that overstory\u2014understory coincidence is due primarily to similar site requirements. Understory species\u0027 response to an overstory succession is examined. Many abundant herbs seem indifferent to dramatic canopy change. This observation and results from nodal component analysis are discussed with respect to forest fire.","publish_time":"1980-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carleton, T. J.; Maycock, P.

METHODS: Literature review (1998\u20132003). RESULTS: With some minor modification, risk factors and major causes of death and disability have, by and large, remained much the same since 1998. However, promoting health at the beginning of the 21st century is not the same as promoting health five years ago. A number of global events and trends have practical implications for health promotion policy and practice. CONCLUSION: This was not meant to be a comprehensive review, but rather an overview to stimulate debate and discussion. We conclude that since our earlier review of health priorities in 1998, \u201Cnothing has changed, but everything has changed\u201D. In a changing global context, there needs to be: greater emphasis on advocacy to create supportive environments, healthy public policy and legislation; partnerships with sectors outside of health to tackle social determinants of health; and leadership development to facilitate individuals and groups to address these important issues. SO WHAT? There needs to be greater emphasis on building effective partnerships to tackkle social determinants of health, as well as leadership development to facilitate participation by disadvantage groups and advocacy for policy and legislative change. Moreover, the field needs to keep abreast with technological changes that will present challenges and opportunities for communicating with target groups.","publish_time":"2004-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giles\u2010Corti, Billie; Wood, Lisa; Donovan, Rob; Rosenberg, Michael; Saunders, Julie; Mills, Christina","journal":"Health Promot J Austr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b0d04fbe68b41feafcca6023501b0d2ceea076a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165586/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["health promotion policy","health promotion practitioners","earlier review of health priorities","tackkle social determinants of health","Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation\u0027s","policy makers","current policy","Literature review","comprehensive review","healthy public policy","recent review of priorities","advocacy","leadership development","disadvantage groups","target groups","practice","greater emphasis","changing global context","number of global events","practical implications","effective partnerships","Healthway","supportive environments","trends","major causes of death","risk factors","legislation","minor modification","strategic plan","participation","sectors","challenges","opportunities","overview","opportunity","individuals","legislative change","technological changes","disability","important issues","debate","discussion","RESULTS","METHODS","beginning","century","field","years","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on geomorphology, alluvial sedimentology, and diatom evidence indicates a dry phase of reduced streamflow between ca. 6700 and 4800 cal. yr B.P. for the Las Pitas River, and 6600 and 3000 cal. yr B.P. for the Miriguaca River. A phase of more humid environmental conditions commenced after ca. 4900 cal. yr B.P. along the Las Pitas River, and after 3000 cal. yr B.P. along the Miriguaca River. Differences in the chronology and magnitude of hydrological changes along both rivers are related to topographic and hydrological characteristics of their respective watersheds. Higher catchment elevation and enhanced orographic precipitation favored greater sensitivity for the Las Pitas River to short humid events during the middle\u2010to\u2010late Holocene. The archaeological evidence suggests that the paleohydrological changes within these catchments played a significant role in human occupational dynamics such that the Las Pitas River offered better environmental conditions for human occupation relative to the Miriguaca River as foragers increasingly relied on plant and animal domestication.","publish_time":"2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grana, Lorena; Tchilinguirian, Pablo; Hocsman, Salom\u00F3n; Escola, Patricia; Maidana, Nora I.","journal":"Geoarchaeology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3bf0df80f9bbbf422332a24632cc8e654ffbe5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165897.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165897/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Las Pitas","Argentina","Las Pitas River","Miriguaca River"],"keyphrases":["Las Pitas River","yr","Miriguaca Rivers","humid environmental conditions","magnitude of hydrological changes","local paleohydrological changes","diatom evidence","hydrological characteristics","archaeological evidence","human occupational dynamics","human occupation relative","short humid events","dry phase of reduced streamflow","orographic precipitation","greater sensitivity","geomorphology","alluvial sedimentology","significant role","south\u2010central Andes of Argentina","middle","catchments","foragers","Paleoenvironmental reconstruction","Higher catchment elevation","impacts","plant","chronology","respective watersheds","hunter\u2010gatherers","article","animal domestication","food","late Holocene","Differences","communities"],"language":"en"},

In preclinical safety studies, pathologies of the respiratory system can be a result of an intercurrent disease or can be induced by systemically administered drugs. Intranasal or inhalation modes of therapy pose particular challenges in terms of the formulations and technologies required to administer a drug. A complex technology is developed to support the assessment of adverse effects of inhaled substances in rodent and nonrodent species, and the extrapolation of experimental findings to humans. The nasal chambers are the structures that are first to be subjected to the effects of inhaled substances, whether microorganisms or chemical substances. In rodents, the relatively small size of the nose and nasal sinuses facilitates a histological examination. Findings show that infectious agents cause inflammation in the nose and nasal sinuses, and this may be associated with inflammation in the conjunctiva, the middle ear, and the oral cavity. It has been observed that a particular response of the rodent nasal mucosa to some irritant substances, including pharmaceutical agents, is the formation of rounded eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium, and to a lesser extent in respiratory and glandular epithelial cells.","publish_time":"2007-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greaves, Peter","journal":"Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal sinuses","irritant substances","chemical substances","nasal chambers","rodent nasal mucosa","assessment of adverse effects of inhaled substances","nose","respiratory system","respiratory tract","inflammation","particular challenges","particular response","pharmaceutical agents","infectious agents","cytoplasm of sustentacular cells","glandular epithelial cells","extrapolation of experimental findings","lesser extent","nonrodent species","inhalation modes of therapy","formation of rounded eosinophilic inclusions","terms","olfactory epithelium","pathologies","microorganisms","middle ear","small size","preclinical safety studies","formulations","result","different aspects","histological examination","technologies","oral cavity","humans","conjunctiva","chapter","intercurrent disease","rodents","structures","complex technology","administered drugs"],"language":"en"},

During replication of the RNA genome there is a high frequency of mutation and recombination, which has given rise to many strains of IBV and results in the potential for new and emerging strains. Currently the live-attenuated vaccine gives poor cross-strain immunity. Effective antiviral agents may therefore be advantageous in the treatment of IBV. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a potent inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus but not RNA viruses. The effect of LiCl on the replication of IBV was examined in cell culture using two model cell types; Vero cells, an African Green monkey kidney-derived epithelial cell line; and DF-1 cells, an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line. When treated with a range of LiCl concentrations, IBV RNA and protein levels and viral progeny production were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types, and the data indicated that inhibition was a cellular rather than a virucidal effect. Host cell protein synthesis still took place in LiCl-treated cells and the level of a standard cellular housekeeping protein remained unchanged, indicating that the effect of LiCl was specifically against IBV.","publish_time":"2007-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrison, Sally M.; Tarpey, Ian; Rothwell, Lisa; Kaiser, Pete; Hiscox, Julian A.","journal":"Avian Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cc9f4a84cb9c7f9353d8d719f39fc2a2a587fbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154305.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154305/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","IBV"],"locations":["African Green"],"keyphrases":["IBV RNA","strains of IBV","replication of IBV","effect of LiCl","cell culture","treatment of IBV","LiCl-treated cells","model cell types","Host cell protein synthesis","range of LiCl concentrations","Vero cells","protein levels","immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line","RNA genome","RNA viruses","virucidal effect","DNA virus herpes simplex virus","African Green monkey kidney-derived epithelial cell line","standard cellular housekeeping protein","emerging strains","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","viral progeny production","place","potent inhibitor","DF","poor cross-strain immunity","major economic pathogen of domestic poultry","vaccination","live-attenuated vaccine","potential","high frequency of mutation","dose-dependent manner","recombination","mortality","significant losses","results","data","Effective antiviral agents","rise","Lithium chloride","inhibition"],"language":"en"},

The properties and behavior of these vectors in heterologous situations are also discussed. Ideally, vectors for gene transfer into human cells should be capable of transgene expression without replication or detrimental expression of viral genes. Infection of human cell lines with intact xenogenic adenoviruses established the principle that these viruses are replication defective at the inputs tested, although the molecular basis for defective replication is not understood. Most work with xenogenic vectors is still firmly based in the laboratory and while this is appropriate to demonstrate the utility of a vector the amount of work required for eventual exploitation of a vector in the clinic should not be underestimated. Understanding the biology of these vectors will ultimately lead to an increased choice of gene delivery vectors, providing more options in therapeutic strategy and design.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Both, Gerald W.","journal":"Adenoviral Vectors for Gene Therapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of xenogenic vectors","increased choice of gene delivery vectors","replication defective","defective replication","gene transfer","utility","work","intact xenogenic adenoviruses","human cells","capable of transgene expression","Infection of human cell lines","detrimental expression of viral genes","principle","options","inputs","vaccination","behavior","molecular basis","therapeutic strategy","eventual exploitation","design","heterologous situations","clinic","chapter","properties","laboratory","biology"],"language":"en"},

This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence that implicates infectious pathogens as triggers. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology resulting in an exacerbation. Much of the treatment of infective exacerbations for both asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of bronchodilators or supportive in the form of oxygen, and in severe cases it includes noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. The current therapy for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD relies on increased treatment of preexisting disease. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The effective use of antiviral agents, particularly for influenza viruses, requires viral diagnosis, commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation, or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Alternative strategies for drug development involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses. Increased knowledge of the host\u2013virus interaction can help in designing treatments that can increase virus clearance and minimize immunopathology.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Message, Simon D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.","journal":"Asthma and COPD","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD","virus-induced exacerbations of asthma","treatment of infective exacerbations","triggering exacerbations","virus interaction","increased treatment of preexisting disease","etiology of asthma","respiratory viruses","influenza viruses","commencement of treatment","virus clearance","chapter","range of different viruses","mechanisms of interaction","Increased knowledge","host-pathogen response","preexisting airway pathology","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","identification of key factors common","drug development","severe cases","viral diagnosis","important role","epidemiological evidence","infectious pathogens","form of oxygen","invasive ventilatory measures","effective use of antiviral agents","bronchodilators","treatments","current therapy","targeting of high-risk groups","Alternative strategies","prophylaxis","triggers","course","Antibiotics","bacterial infections","immunopathology"],"language":"en"},

In molecular evolution one of the remarkable observations has been the uniformity of the molecular clock. An analysis of proteins derived from complete potyvirus genomes, positive-stranded RNA viruses, yielded highly significant linear relationships. These analyses indicate that viral protein diversification is essentially a smooth process, the major parameter being the nature of the protein more than the ecological niche it finds itself in. Synonymous changes are invariably more frequent than nonsynonymous changes. Positive selection exploits a small proportion of genetic variants, while functional sequence space is sufficiently dense, allowing viable solutions to be found. Although evolution has connotations of change, what has always counted is natural selection or adaptation.

Fluorescent nanodiamond (FND), an inherently biocompatible and nontoxic nanoparticle, is well suited for such applications. We had developed a prospective isolation method using CD157, CD45, and CD54 to obtain lung stem cells. Labeling of CD45(\u2212)CD54(\u002B)CD157(\u002B) cells with FNDs did not eliminate their abilities for self-renewal and differentiation. The FND labeling in combination with cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and immunostaining identified transplanted stem cells allowed tracking of their engraftment and regenerative capabilities with single-cell resolution. Time-gated fluorescence (TGF) imaging in mouse tissue sections indicated that they reside preferentially at the bronchoalveolar junctions of lungs, especially in naphthalene-injured mice. Our results presented in Subchapter 1.1 demonstrate not only the remarkable homing capacity and regenerative potential of the isolated stem cells, but also the ability of finding rare lung stem cells in vivo using FNDs. The topical use of antiretroviral-based microbicides, namely of a dapivirine ring, has been recently shown to partially prevent transmission of HIV through the vaginal route. Among different formulation approaches, nanotechnology tools and principles have been used for the development of tentative vaginal and rectal microbicide products. Subchapter 1.2 provides an overview of antiretroviral drug nanocarriers as novel microbicide candidates and discusses recent and relevant research on the topic. Furthermore, advances in developing vaginal delivery platforms for the administration of promising antiretroviral drug nanocarriers are reviewed. Although mostly dedicated to the discussion of nanosystems for vaginal use, the development of rectal nanomicrobicides is also addressed. Infectious diseases are currently responsible for over 8 million deaths per year. Efficient treatments require accurate recognition of pathogens at low concentrations, which in the case of blood infection (septicemia) can go as low as 1 mL(\u20131). Detecting and quantifying bacteria at such low concentrations is challenging and typically demands cultures of large samples of blood (\u223C1 mL) extending over 24\u201372 h. This delay seriously compromises the health of patients and is largely responsible for the death toll of bacterial infections. Recent advances in nanoscience, spectroscopy, plasmonics, and microfluidics allow for the development of optical devices capable of monitoring minute amounts of analytes in liquid samples. In Subchapter 1.3 we critically discuss these recent developments that will, in the future, enable the multiplex identification and quantification of microorganisms directly on their biological matrix with unprecedented speed, low cost, and sensitivity. Radiolabeled nanoparticles (NPs) are finding an increasing interest in a broad range of biomedical applications. They may be used to detect and characterize diseases, to deliver relevant therapeutics, and to study the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of nanomaterials. The use of radiotracer techniques in the research of novel NPs offers many advantages, but there are still some limitations. The binding of radionuclides to NPs has to be irreversible to prevent their escape to other tissues or organs. Due to the short half-lives of radionuclides, the manufacturing process is time limited and difficult, and there is also a risk of contamination. Subchapter 1.4 presents the main selection criteria for radionuclides and applicable radiolabeling procedures used for the radiolabeling of various NPs. Also, an overview of different types of NPs that have so far been labeled with radionuclides is presented.","publish_time":"2017-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Tsai-Jung; Chiu, Hsiao-Yu; Yu, John; Cautela, Mafalda P.; Sarmento, Bruno; das Neves, Jos\u00E9; Catala, Carme; Pazos-Perez, Nicolas; Guerrini, Luca; Alvarez-Puebla, Ramon A.; Vranje\u0161-\u0110uri\u0107, Sanja; Ignjatovi\u0107, Nenad L.","journal":"Nanotechnologies in Preventive and Regenerative Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nanotechnology","FND"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Subchapter","stem cell research","transplanted stem cells","isolated stem cells","vaginal use","research of novel NPs","rare lung stem cells","low concentrations","various NPs","development of tentative vaginal","regenerative potential","relevant research","low cost","vaginal route","Recent advances","overview of different types of NPs","binding of radionuclides","topical use of antiretroviral","overview of antiretroviral drug nanocarriers","cell sorting","regenerative capabilities","regenerative medicine","vaginal delivery platforms","development of rectal nanomicrobicides","CD157","CD45","short half-lives of radionuclides","FNDs","CD54","recent developments","administration of promising antiretroviral drug nanocarriers","novel microbicide candidates","single-cell resolution","rectal microbicide products","Time-gated fluorescence","use of radiotracer techniques","great potential","fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy","nanotechnology tools","liquid samples","time limited","broad range of biomedical applications","cultures of large samples of blood","relevant therapeutics","Infectious diseases","different formulation approaches","case of blood infection","development of optical devices capable of monitoring minute amounts of analytes","immunostaining","TGF","tracking","manufacturing process","biological matrix","accurate recognition of pathogens","engraftment","ability","unprecedented speed","based microbicides","main selection criteria","spectroscopy","principles","enabling technology","combination","remarkable homing capacity","quantification of microorganisms","mouse tissue sections","multiplex identification","Efficient treatments","plasmonics","microfluidics","procedures","prospective isolation method","nanoscience","septicemia","death toll of bacterial infections","discussion of nanosystems","escape","bronchoalveolar junctions of lungs","naphthalene-injured mice","nontoxic nanoparticle","pharmacodynamic parameters of nanomaterials","self-renewal","differentiation","future","transmission of HIV","sensitivity","quantifying bacteria","advantages","dapivirine ring","tissues","organs","deaths","Fluorescent nanodiamond","health of patients","Radiolabeled nanoparticles","risk of contamination","year","results","limitations"],"language":"en"},

They address and overcome the physical and economic limits of current microelectronic industry and will lead to reduced power consumption and largely increased device speed in next generation electronics and optoelectronics. This paper reviews the recent development on the device applications of 1-D nanostructures in electronics and optoelectronics. First, typical 1-D nanostructure forms, including nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, nanobelts, and hetero-nanowires, synthesized from different methods are briefly discussed. Then, some nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices built on 1-D nanostructures are presented, including field-effect transistors (FETs), p-n diodes, ultraviolet (UV) detectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), nanolasers, integrated nanodevices, single nanowire solar cells, chemical sensors, biosensors, and nanogenerators. We then finalize the paper with some perspectives and outlook towards the fast-growing topics.","publish_time":"2010-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Guozhen; Chen, Di","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a8020bf22d28a627c07758f57e0cff9bfa94be5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D nanostructures","optoelectronics","nanoscale electronics","device applications","generation electronics","D nanostructure forms","paper","potential applications","hetero-nanowires","increased device speed","unique physical properties","p-n diodes","focus of current researches","economic limits of current microelectronic industry","single nanowire solar cells","chemical sensors","integrated nanodevices","FETs","nanolasers","nanorods","reduced power consumption","biosensors","UV","light","LEDs","nanobelts","detectors","optoelectronic devices","field-effect transistors","perspectives","outlook","nanotubes","recent development","fast-growing topics","nanogenerators","different methods"],"language":"en"},

RESEARCH: Many studies seek to enhance the effects of catechins on the human body and boost their protective power against UV radiation. There are many examples of the positive anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergenic, and anti-cancer effects of catechins. Catechins increase the penetration and absorption of healthy functional foods and bio cosmetics into the body and the skin, thus improving their utility. High value-added anti-oxidant substances have been extracted from food and plant sludge, and experiments have shown that catechins are safe when applied to the human body. The stability of catechins is very important for their absorption into the human body and the effectiveness of their anti-oxidant properties. CONCLUSION: Continued research on the strong anti-oxidant effects of catechins is expected to result in many advances in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bae, Joonseo; Kim, Nayoung; Shin, Yunyoung; Kim, Soo-Yeon; Kim, You-Jeong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/213abf509944bb5ecf4622ab6ec17bfb26e7c6d2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-cancer effects of catechins","strong anti-oxidant effects of catechins","anti-oxidant properties","stability of catechins","strong anti-oxidants","human body","High value-added anti-oxidant substances","bio cosmetics","Continued research","absorption of healthy functional foods","important component of tea leaves","anti-inflammatory","experiments","protective power","penetration","effectiveness","plants","polyphenol compounds","UV radiation","plant sludge","pharmaceutical industries","CONCLUSION","examples","skin","advances","BACKGROUND","studies","utility"],"language":"en"},

All three infections may cause serious, debilitating, and sometimes fatal diarrheal disease in nursling and weanling mice. Mice of all ages can be infected by the EDIM virus but overt disease is restricted to animals up to about 12\u201313 days of age at the time of first exposure. The EDIM virus is worldwide in distribution. Its prevalence is difficult to estimate because serologic tests have not been readily available, and it is not customary to sacrifice animals for the purpose of examining the appearance of their intestinal tract or for electron microscopic visualization of fecal contents. The acute disease of reovirus 3 infection affects mainly sucklings and weanlings, whereas the chronic disease is encountered in animals over 28 days of age. The MHV virus, on the other hand, has been found to affect cotton rats, rats, and hamsters.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraft, Lisbeth M.","journal":"Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149642.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EDIM virus","virus infections","MHV virus","animals","chronic disease","overt disease","weanling mice","murine hepatitis virus infection","acute disease of reovirus","fatal diarrheal disease","digestive system of mice","days of age","epizootic diarrhea of infant mice","cotton rats","electron microscopic visualization of fecal contents","intestinal tract","properties","debilitating","nursling","sucklings","weanlings","serologic tests","appearance","purpose","time","hamsters","prevalence","exposure","hand","chapter","ages","distribution"],"language":"en"},

The following classes of compounds are considered as the basis for modification: polycyclic antibacterial glycopeptides of the vancomycin group, classical macrolides, antifungal polyene macrolides, the antitumour antibiotic olivomycin A, antitumour anthracyclines and broad-spectrum antibiotics, in particular, oligomycin A, heliomycin and some other. Main trends in the design of modern anti-infective and antitumour agents over this period are considered in relation to original natural antibiotics, which have been independently discovered by Russian researchers. It is shown that a new type of hybrid structures can, in principle, be synthesized based on glycopeptides, macrolides and other antibiotics, including heterodimers containing a new benzoxaborole pharmacophore. The review addresses the influence of the length of the spacer between two antibiotic molecules on the biological activity of hybrid structures. A combination of genetic engineering techniques and methods of organic synthesis is shown to be useful for the design of new potent antifungal antibiotics based on polyenes of the amphotericin B group. Many new semi-synthetic analogues exhibit important biological properties, such as a broad spectrum of activity and low toxicity. Emphasis is given to certain aspects related to investigation of a broad range of biological activity and mechanisms of action of new derivatives. The bibliography includes 101 references.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olsufyeva, Evgenia N.; Yankovskaya, Valentina S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bd206c313f628703bf896ecb80d2a37e1a178a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Emphasis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new generation","new derivatives","design of new potent antifungal antibiotics","broad-spectrum antibiotics","new semi-synthetic analogues","new type of hybrid structures","new benzoxaborole pharmacophore","characterization of semi-synthetic antibiotics","biological activity of hybrid structures","original natural antibiotics","broad range of biological activity","antitumour anthracyclines","antitumour antibiotic olivomycin","antifungal polyene macrolides","antitumour agents","classical macrolides","broad spectrum of activity","period","Russian researchers","review","important biological properties","vancomycin group","antibiotic molecules","Main trends","main advances","methods of organic synthesis","design of modern anti-infective","polycyclic antibacterial glycopeptides","amphotericin B group","polyenes","mechanisms of action","combination of genetic engineering techniques","basis","investigation","heterodimers","spacer","modification","length","oligomycin","low toxicity","relation","certain aspects","influence","principle","following classes of compounds","Emphasis","heliomycin","bibliography","references"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections have been transmitted via tissue allografts such as bone, skin, cornea, and heart valves. Bone allografts have transmitted hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and human T-cell leukaemia virus. Corneas have transmitted rabies, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus. Heart valves have been implicated in transmitting hepatitis B. HIV-1 and CMV have been transmitted by skin allografts. Use of comprehensive donor eligibility criteria; excluding potential donors with behaviours risky for HIV-1 and hepatitis infection, and donor blood testing have greatly reduced the risk. Recent reports of HIV transmitted from a seronegative donors prompts the addition of viral nucleic acid testing of the donor. During tissue processing, many allografts are exposed to disinfectants and sterilisation steps such as gamma irradiation, which further reduce or remove the risk of transmitted disease. Some viruses are fairly resistant to gamma irradiation and the high doses needed may be harmful to the tissue allografts. Because the effectiveness of some tissue grafts depends on cellular viability, not all can be subjected to sterilisation steps, and, therefore, the risk of infectious disease transmission remains. For these, preventing the transmission of viral infection relies mostly on careful donor selection and viral testing, but processing with mild disinfectant can be useful. To further assure safety in the use of allografts, the physician and hospital should select tissue banks that follow national professional standards as their source for allografts.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eastlund, Ted","journal":"Sterilisation of Tissues Using Ionising Radiations","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152342.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152342/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

Protein expression of Trx system family members has been assessed in various cancers and linked to various clinicopathological variables, disease progression, treatment response and survival outcomes but information is lacking in brain tumours. Expression of the system was therefore examined, by immunohistochemistry in different brain tumour types, adult and paediatric cases, to determine if expression was of importance to clinical outcome. Trx system proteins were expressed, to variable levels, across all brain tumour types with significant variations in expression between different tumour types/grades/regions. High Trx reductase (TrxR) expression was linked to worse prognosis across all cohorts. High cytoplasmic TrxR expression was significantly associated with adverse overall survival (OS) in adult glioblastoma (P = 0.027) and paediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (P = 0.012).

For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the spike protein (S) is the main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates the process of membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium ions (Ca2\u002B) play an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2\u002B binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2\u002B is required for MERS-CoV fusion by screening a mutant array in which E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP were substituted with neutrally charged alanines (A). Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested their ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells in modulating Ca2\u002B environments. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2\u002B enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2\u002B interaction. Subsequent electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2\u002B increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry showed an approximate 1:1 MERS-CoV FP to Ca2\u002B ratio, as opposed to an 1:2 SARS-CoV FP to Ca2\u002B ratio, suggesting significant differences in FP Ca2\u002B interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity.SignificanceMERS-CoV is a major emerging infectious disease with zoonotic potential and a reservoir in dromedary camels and bats. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. In order to develop novel drugs and vaccines, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable the virus to infect host cells. Our data has found that calcium is an important regulator of viral fusion by interacting with negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV FP region. This can guide therapeutic solutions to either block this calcium interaction and also repurpose already approved drugs for this use for a fast response to MERS-CoV outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Straus, Marco R; Tang, Tiffany; Lai, Alex L; Flegel, Annkatrin; Bidon, Miya; Freed, Jack H; Daniel, Susan; Whittaker, Gary R","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00426-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV fusion","SARS-CoV FP","FP Ca2","MERS-CoV FP region","MERS-CoV outbreaks","SignificanceMERS-CoV","MERS-CoV WT PPs infection","increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering","interactions of MERS","modulating Ca2","intracellular Ca2","fusion peptide","important regulator of viral fusion","process of membrane fusion","D residues","host cells","calcium interaction","approved drugs","efficacious drugs","important role","ratio","novel drugs","vaccines","subsequent entry","calcium ions","Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes","high sequence similarity","high sequence homology","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","zoonotic potential","aspartic acid","mutant array","mutant cell surface expression","dromedary camels","main determinant of viral entry","conserved glutamic acid","infection of pseudo-particles","Subsequent electron spin resonance","binding pocket","major emerging infectious disease","ESR","reservoir","significant differences","fusogenic activity","fast response","experiments","critical steps","ability","Previous studies","crucial residue","life cycle of enveloped viruses","confirmed cases","fold","E891","environments","spike protein","humans","public health emergency","bats","molecular mechanisms","enhancement","therapeutic solutions","isothermal calorimetry","deaths","date","results","data","alanines"],"language":"en"},

Given the overwhelming demand of facility capacity, the impact on all healthcare sectors has to be addressed. Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units and follow-up facilities. The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of healthcare capacities. In addition, the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addressing these crucial questions, transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance, derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies. Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending non-urgent transplant procedures and living donation programs.

Older adults who are dependent in ADLs and IADLs are also more likely to have poor muscle measures defined as low muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance, which further limit their ability to perform activities. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if muscle measures are predictive of ADL and IADL in older populations. Methods A systematic search was conducted using four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL) from date of inception to 7 June 2018. Longitudinal cohorts were included that reported baseline muscle measures defined by muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in conjunction with prospective ADL or IADL in participants aged 65 years and older at follow-up. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effect model. Results Of the 7760 articles screened, 83 articles were included for the systematic review and involved a total of 108 428 (54.8% female) participants with a follow-up duration ranging from 11 days to 25 years. Low muscle mass was positively associated with ADL dependency in 5/9 articles and 5/5 for IADL dependency. Low muscle strength was associated with ADL dependency in 22/34 articles and IADL dependency in 8/9 articles. Low physical performance was associated with ADL dependency in 37/49 articles and with IADL dependency in 9/11 articles. Forty-five articles were pooled into the meta-analyses, 36 reported ADL, 11 reported IADL, and 2 reported ADL and IADL as a composite outcome. Low muscle mass was associated with worsening ADL (pooled odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.19 (1.29-7.92)) and worsening IADL (1.28 (1.02-1.61)). Low handgrip strength was associated with both worsening ADL and IADL (1.51 (1.34-1.70); 1.59 (1.04-2.31) respectively). Low scores on the short physical performance battery and gait speed were associated with worsening ADL (3.49 (2.47-4.92); 2.33 (1.58-3.44) respectively) and IADL (3.09 (1.06-8.98); 1.93 (1.69-2.21) respectively). Low one leg balance (2.74 (1.31-5.72)), timed up and go (3.41 (1.86-6.28)), and chair stand test time (1.90 (1.63-2.21)) were associated with worsening ADL. Conclusions Muscle measures at baseline are predictors of future ADL and IADL dependence in the older adult population.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Daniel X M; Yao, Jessica; Zirek, Yasar; Reijnierse, Esmee M; Maier, Andrea B","journal":"Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31788969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADL","IADL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["worsening ADL","IADL dependency","reported ADL","worsening IADL","articles","low muscle mass","Low muscle strength","reported IADL","prospective ADL","predictive of ADL","IADL dependence","poor muscle measures","Conclusions Muscle measures","Low physical performance","reported baseline muscle measures","predictors of future ADL","Low scores","Low handgrip strength","older populations","Older adults","short physical performance battery","Meta-analyses","systematic review","older adult population","instrumental activities of daily living","Background Activities of daily living","independent living","IADLs","participants","meta-analysis","systematic search","years","predictors of morbidity","follow-up duration","pooled odds ratio","gait speed","conjunction","Cochrane","databases","CINAHL","EMBASE","female","mortality","confidence interval","Longitudinal cohorts","composite outcome","chair stand test time","MEDLINE","random effect model","days","total","aim","date of inception","Methods","leg balance","ability","Results"],"language":"en"},

In the current scenario, where there is mass fear against COVID-19, this recommendation has made the people to believe that it will kill the viruses. This has important public health implications which are discussed below. Better communication should have been planned to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. However, as a nation of 1.3 billion, we need to capitalize on this opportunity to generate data and valuable evidence on the use of HCQ to beat this pandemic. All health care workers taking this drug should volunteer themselves to be part of a trial/observational study and get registered online to generate useful data related to its safety and efficacy and guide future recommendations. The other risk group which includes asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients are under surveillance by the state and local health authorities and could also be roped into this study to generate robust evidence.

Data on the rates of pituitary dysfunction and recovery in a large cohort of NFPA patients undergoing ETSS and the predictors of endocrine function before and after ETSS are scarce. This study is purposed to analyze the comprehensive changes in hormonal function and identify factors that predict recovery or worsening of hormonal axes following ETSS for NFPA. METHODS A retrospective review of 601 consecutive patients who underwent ETSS between 2010 and 2018 at one institution was performed. Recovery or development of new hypopituitarism was analyzed in 209 NFPA patients who underwent ETSS. RESULTS Patients with preoperative endocrine deficits (59.8%) in one or more pituitary axes had larger tumor volumes (P = 0.001) than those without preoperative deficits. Recovery of preoperative pituitary deficit occurred in all four axes, with overall mean recovery of 29.7%. The cortisol axis showed the highest recovery whereas the thyroid axis showed the lowest, with 1-year cumulative recovery rates of 44.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Postoperative hypopituitarism occurred overall in 17.2%, most frequently in the thyroid axis (24.3%, 27/111) and least frequently in the cortisol axis (9.7%, 16/165). Axis-specific predictors of post-operative recovery and deficiency were identified. CONCLUSIONS Dynamic alterations in pituitary hormones were observed in a proportion of patients following ETSS in NFPA patients. Postoperative endocrine vulnerability, recovery, and factors that predicted recovery or loss of endocrine function depended on the hormonal system, necessitating an axis-specific surveillance strategy postoperatively.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Jenie Y; Aum, Diane J; Chicoine, Michael R; Dacey, Ralph G; Osbun, Joshua W; Rich, Keith M; Zipfel, Gregory J; Klatt-Cromwell, Cristine N; McJunkin, Jonathan L; Pipkorn, Patrik; Schneider, John S; Silverstein, Julie M; Kim, Albert H","journal":"Pituitary","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-020-01045-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ETSS","NFPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ETSS","highest recovery","mean recovery","Recovery of preoperative pituitary deficit","pituitary axes","consecutive patients","proportion of patients","RESULTS Patients","thyroid axis","cortisol axis","Axis-specific predictors of post-operative recovery","year cumulative recovery rates","large cohort of NFPA patients","pituitary hormones","predictors of endocrine function","hormonal function","hormonal axes","preoperative endocrine deficits","rates of pituitary dysfunction","loss of endocrine function","axis-specific surveillance strategy","preoperative deficits","nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas","Postoperative endocrine vulnerability","factors","hormonal system","Postoperative hypopituitarism","development of new hypopituitarism","well-established treatment","larger tumor volumes","PURPOSE Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery","CONCLUSIONS Dynamic alterations","retrospective review","comprehensive changes","deficiency","NFPAs","METHODS","Data","study","institution"],"language":"en"},

As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center. Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment. We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub-and-spoke design. Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer. Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.

Although a large number of computational models of the olfactory system have been proposed, they do not account for the diversity in physiology, connectivity of local neurons, and several recent discoveries in the insect antennal lobe, a major olfactory organ in insects. Recent studies revealed that the response of some projection neurons were reduced by application of a GABA antagonist, and that insects are sensitive to odor pulse frequency. To account for these observations, we propose a spiking neural circuit model of the insect antennal lobe. Based on recent anatomical and physiological studies, we included three sub-types of local neurons as well as synaptic short-term depression (STD) in the model and showed that the interaction between STD and local neurons resulted in frequency-sensitive responses. We further discovered that the unexpected response of the projection neurons to the GABA antagonist is the result of complex interactions between STD and presynaptic inhibition, which is required for enhancing sensitivity to odor stimuli. Finally, we found that odor discrimination is improved if the innervation of the local neurons in the glomeruli follows a specific pattern. Our findings suggest that STD, presynaptic inhibition and diverse physiology and connectivity of local neurons are not independent properties, but they interact to play key roles in the function of antennal lobes.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kao, Kuo-Wei; Lo, Chung-Chuan","journal":"Journal of computational neuroscience","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-020-00747-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["connectivity of local neurons","projection neurons","STD","sub-types of local neurons","olfactory system","Recent studies","insect antennal lobe","presynaptic inhibition","GABA antagonist","insects","understood sensory system","recent discoveries","odor pulse frequency","odor stimuli","odor discrimination","major olfactory organ","function of antennal lobes","frequency-sensitive responses","diverse physiology","sensory neurobiology","physiological studies","unexpected response","spiking neural circuit model","result of complex interactions","evolution","synaptic short-term depression","challenging research targets","large number of computational models","glomeruli","application","innervation","key roles","independent properties","findings","diversity","specific pattern","observations","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19. SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general. We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning. However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation. Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19. From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease. This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations. A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khalatbari-Soltani, Saman; Cumming, Robert G; Delpierre, Cyrille; Kelly-Irving, Michelle","journal":"Journal of epidemiology and community health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential risk factors of COVID","known risk factors of COVID","important socioeconomic characteristics","influence of socioeconomic factors","socioeconomic determinants","Disadvantaged socioeconomic position","systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients","occupational position of patients","severe disease","emerged coronavirus disease","potential determinant of infectious diseases","report data","important role","pandemic level","health-related behaviours","equitable public health prevention measures","guidelines","literature highlights","study","presence of comorbidities","race","transmission","ethnicity","conditions","interventions","immune functioning","brief overview","high-risk populations","case","severity","eligible studies","scrutiny","investigation","vulnerable groups","outcomes","mortality","spreads","reason","Individuals","extent"],"language":"en"},

This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na\u002B /H\u002B exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS The related literatures in the field of CoVs treatment were retrieved from the establishment of Web of Science core collection database to February 15th, 2020, and the literature analysis tool of Web of Science database was used to count the annual trend of published literatures. The VOSviewer software was used to analyze the relationship among countries, institutions, authors, clustering and density of subject words. The HistCite software was used to screen important documents and to draw the evolution process of hot spots. The CiteSpace software was used to analyze the breakout points of subject words, so as to find the front and hot spots in this field. RESULTS A total of 1 747 data were retrieved, with the exception of 17 duplicate data, and 1 730 data were retained for visualization analysis. In terms of literature volume, the literatures on CoVs therapy rose after 2003 and 2012, and the number of published literatures had remained high since 2014. In terms of countries, the main countries that carried out the research on the treatment of CoVs were the United States (n = 613), China (n = 582), Germany (n = 122), Canada (n = 99), etc., and the cooperation among countries was close. In terms of institutions, the number of papers issued by Chinese Academy of Sciences in the field of CoVs treatment ranked first (n = 82), followed by University of Hong Kong of China (n = 74) and Chinese University of Hong Kong of China (n = 58), followed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (n = 37), and the cooperation among various institutions was close. In terms of literature authors, there were two high-yielding authors in the United States [Ralph S. Baric (n = 21) and Kuochen Chou (n = 17)], two Chinese authors [Yuen Kwok-yung (n = 17) and Jiang Shibo (n = 16)] and one Dutch author [Eric J. Snijder (n = 17)]. In terms of the cluster analysis of authors, the authors were closely related in reverse genetics, respiratory infection, receptor binding domain, etc., and the 15 top-cited papers came mainly from China, the United States, Netherlands and other countries, and the literature content represented the frontiers and hot spots in different periods. The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation. The main subject words were divided into three main categories, namely, CoVs epidemiology, basic research and drug development, in which basic research and drug development were strongly correlated. In the subject words breakthrough analysis, there were time-related breakthrough points in 1991, 1996 and 2002, and the \u0022diagnosis\u0022 and \u0022sequence\u0022 were continuous hot spots. CONCLUSIONS Through the visualization analysis of knowledge graph, the development trend and hot spots of CoVs therapy research could be well observed. In this study, the degree of attention in the field of CoVs treatment showed periodic changes, related to the outbreak of new CoVs, and the country, institutions and the author were closely related. The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation in order to develop new targets of drug.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yi, Wei; Wang, Yu; Tang, Jianqiao; Xiong, Xiaoli; Zhang, Yuesheng; Yan, Suqi","journal":"Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200225-00200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385990/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ralph S.

However, Colombia has insufficient studies on mining and its repercussions, which limits estimates of mining impacts on ecosystems and the human population. Due to the rise of mining activities in Colombia, the negative impacts generated by coal and Hg will also continue to increase. This review analyzes national information levels on coal and Hg in island/coastal/marine as well as freshwater ecosystems and human groups using fishery resources as a framework. This is because fish are the main source of animal protein in marine coastal-island and mainland communities. Here, 15 of 32 Colombian departments have records on total mercury (THg) in water, sediments, fish, and human communities. Around 205 ton/year of mercury is discharged into the ecosystem. In human hair for example (15.3 to 50.15 \u03BCg/g), mercury exceeds the international maximum levels allowed (ILA) and the national standard (5.0 \u03BCg/g). Mercury levels in freshwater fish show 3.3 \u03BCg/g of THg and levels in marine and coastal-island fish are 1.2 \u03BCg/g THg exceeding the ILA (0.5 \u03BCg/g) standard for fish that will be consumed.

We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID-19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID-19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last three years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%) and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID-19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last three months was 17 (11 men, 6 women).

A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published in scientific journals, as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. Yet, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is missing. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the current SARS-CoV-2 full genome data, in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signal, to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS We used maximum likelihood based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments, assembled from GISAID data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS Although number of high quality full-genomes is growing daily, and recent sequence data released in April contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations. CONCLUSIONS At the present time, studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating. Hence, the need for interpreting current reports with caution, and continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.

Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic. Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed. Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening. Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation. Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus.

The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment. METHODS Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2mg/10ml) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling following nasal fluorescein application. RESULTS Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30cm extending to 66cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all tested conditions. CONCLUSION We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an \u0022Aerosol Generating Surgery\u0022 to convey this unique risk, and support the need for protective PPE.

METHODS A compositional analysis as well as a Bayesian coalescent analysis of complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains recently isolated in Europe, North America, South America and Asia was performed. RESULTS The results of these studies revealed a diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains in three different genetic clades. Co-circulation of different clades in different countries, as well as different genetic lineages within different clades were observed. The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was established to be around November 1, 2019. A mean rate of evolution of 6.57 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year was found. A significant migration rate per genetic lineage per year from Europe to South America was also observed.

When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers\u0027 adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines. These strategies can be difficult and time-consuming to adhere to in practice. Authorities and healthcare facilities therefore need to consider how best to support healthcare workers to implement them. OBJECTIVES To identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers\u0027 adherence to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. SEARCH METHODS We searched OVID MEDLINE on 26 March 2020. As we searched only one database due to time constraints, we also undertook a rigorous and comprehensive scoping exercise and search of the reference lists of key papers. We did not apply any date limit or language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with a distinct qualitative component) that focused on the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers towards factors that impact on their ability to adhere to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. We included studies of any type of healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care. We included studies that focused on IPC guidelines (local, national or international) for respiratory infectious diseases in any healthcare setting. These selection criteria were framed by an understanding of the needs of health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Four review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by our search. We used a prespecified sampling frame to sample from the eligible studies, aiming to capture a range of respiratory infectious disease types, geographical spread and data-rich studies. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this synthesis. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used a \u0027best fit framework approach\u0027 to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided upfront analytical categories, with scope for further thematic analysis. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. Our review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers\u0027 ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were long and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of support they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw the value of it. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Houghton, Catherine; Meskell, Pauline; Delaney, Hannah; Smalle, Mike; Glenton, Claire; Booth, Andrew; Chan, Xin Hui S; Devane, Declan; Biesty, Linda M","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315451/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OVID MEDLINE","IPC","Healthcare","PPE","CONCLUSIONS Healthcare"],"locations":["Asia","Africa","North America","Australia","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["IPC guidelines","healthcare setting","healthcare facilities","perceptions of healthcare workers","local guidelines","international guidelines","healthcare workers\u0027 adherence","healthcare workers\u0027 ability","eligible studies","relevant studies","data-rich studies","respiratory infections","new respiratory infectious diseases","type of healthcare worker","mixed-methods studies","range of respiratory infectious disease types","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","COVID","pandemic","needs of health workers","DATA COLLECTION","SEARCH METHODS","review authors","review points","facilitators","barriers","Reviews of Qualitative research","data extraction form","high confidence","following factors","practice","thematic analysis","SELECTION CRITERIA","evidence","Strategies","distinct qualitative component","experiences of nurses","patient care","best fit framework approach","series of rapid reviews","community care settings","geographical spread","H1N1","infection prevention","adapted version","Critical Skills Appraisal Programme","PPE","tuberculosis","MERS","SARS","control","use of personal protective equipment","gowns","gloves","masks","CASP","comprehensive scoping exercise","intervention implementation","sample","TB","responsibility","understanding","doctors","face shields","reference lists of key papers","separation of patients","tool","prespecified sampling frame","developed implications","Cochrane contributors","scope","findings","titles","impact","North America","date limit","language limits","Africa","abstracts","methodological limitations","stricter cleaning routines","texts","synthesis","OVID MEDLINE","MAIN RESULTS","hospitals","time constraints","analytical categories","seasonal influenza","GRADE-CERQual","database","Australia","OBJECTIVES","Asia","Authorities","BACKGROUND","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers","support staff","IPC guidance","IPC strategies","cleaning staff","kitchen staff","facility staff","lack of training","lack of PPE","level of support","infected patients","equipment uncomfortable","personal protective equipment","workplace culture","managers","factors","importance","problem","lack of isolation rooms","easy access","physical space","shower facilities","handwashing facilities","Sufficient space","additional cleaning","infection outbreaks","desire","anterooms","trust","serious concern","porters","minimising overcrowding","increased workloads","important practical measures","fatigue","volume of supplies","instance","poor quality","visitors","respiratory infectious diseases","ability","willingness","responses","good patient care","fear","Clear communication","families","need","management team","review","value"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to these ecologically relevant toxicants is prominent in Northern Canadian populations. Previous work focused on toxicant exposure during pregnancy as a threat to fetal neurodevelopment. However, little is known about the individual and combined effects of these toxicants on maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to synthesize the current knowledge regarding individual and combined effects of methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorine pesticides on maternal behaviour and the maternal brain. Relevant studies were identified through the PubMed, Embase, and Toxline databases. Literature involving animal models and one human cohort were included in the review. Results: Research findings indicate that exposures to these environmental toxicants are associated with neurochemical changes in rodent models. Animal models provided the majority of information on toxicant-induced alterations in maternal care behaviours. Molecular and hormonal changes hypothesized to underlie these alterations were also addressed, although studies assessing toxicant co-exposure were limited. Conclusion: This review speaks to the limited knowledge regarding effects of these persistent organic pollutants on the maternal brain and related behavioural outcomes. Further research is required to better comprehend any such effects on maternal brain and behaviour, as maternal care is an important contributor to offspring neurodevelopment.","publish_time":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fong-McMaster, Claire; Konji, Sandra; Nitschke, Amanda; Konkle, Anne Tm","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17030926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Toxline"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal brain","maternal behaviour","maternal health","maternal care behaviours","Environmental toxicants","relevant toxicants","toxicant exposure","combined effects of methylmercury","animal models","toxicant co-exposure","organochlorine pesticides","polychlorinated biphenyls","pregnancy","toxicant-induced alterations","individual","rodent models","Relevant studies","limited knowledge","scoping review","current knowledge","neurochemical changes","hormonal changes","offspring neurodevelopment","fetal neurodevelopment","Research findings","harmful pollutants present","persistent organic pollutants","soil","contaminated food","majority of information","PubMed","exposures","important contributor","threat","Northern Canadian populations","human cohort","related behavioural outcomes","air","post-partum","Previous work","Embase","Toxline databases","Results","Literature","Background","water","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We herein describe a 35-year-old Asian man with pulmonary tuberculosis and perforated duodenal ulcer who presented with hyponatremia with hourly fluctuating urine osmolality ranging from 100 to 600 mosmol/kg, which resembled urine osmolality observed in typical polydipsia and SIADH simultaneously. Further review revealed correlation of body temperature and urine osmolality. Since fever is a known non-osmotic stimulus of ADH secretion, we theorized that hyponatremia in this patient was due to transient ADH secretion due to fever. In our case, empiric exogenous glucocorticoid suppressed transient non-osmotic ADH secretion and urine osmolality showed highly variable concentrations. Transient ADH secretion-related hyponatremia may be underrecognized due to occasional empiric glucocorticoid administration in patients with critical illnesses. Repeatedly monitoring of urine chemistries and interpretation of urine chemistries with careful review of non-osmotic stimuli of ADH including fever is crucial in recognition of this etiology. Learning points Hourly fluctuations in urine osmolality can be observed in patients with fever, which is a non-osmotic stimulant of ADH secretion. Repeated monitoring of urine chemistries aids in the diagnosis of the etiology underlying hyponatremia, including fever, in patients with transient ADH secretion. Glucocorticoid administration suppresses ADH secretion and improves hyponatremia even in the absence of adrenal insufficiency; the etiology of hyponatremia should be determined carefully in these patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Son, Raku; Nagahama, Masahiko; Tanemoto, Fumiaki; Ito, Yugo; Taki, Fumika; Tsugitomi, Ryosuke; Nakayama, Masaaki","journal":"Endocrinology, diabetes \u0026 metabolism case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-19-0155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIADH","ADH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transient non-osmotic ADH secretion","etiology of hyponatremia","Transient ADH secretion-related hyponatremia","fever","non-osmotic stimulant of ADH secretion","hourly fluctuating urine osmolality","interpretation of urine chemistries","known non-osmotic stimulus of ADH secretion","patients","careful review of non-osmotic stimuli of ADH","Repeated monitoring of urine chemistries aids","empiric exogenous glucocorticoid","occasional empiric glucocorticoid administration","Learning points Hourly fluctuations","pulmonary tuberculosis","perforated duodenal ulcer","year-old Asian man","correlation of body temperature","diagnosis","critical illnesses","absence of adrenal insufficiency","case","typical polydipsia","recognition","variable concentrations","SIADH","Summary","sodium","mosmol"],"language":"en"},

Methods: According to \u0022The Prevention and Control Protocol for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Third Edition)\u0022 issued by the National Health Commission, a field epidemiological survey was conducted for the 5 cases in January 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from them for the detection of 2019-nCoV by real time RT-PCR. Multi prevention and control measures were taken, such as tracking and screening close contacts, medical isolation observation, investigating the epidemiological link, analyzing transmission chain. Results: Case 1, who had common environmental exposure with other COVID\u204319 cases, got sick on 20 January, 2020 and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 2 became symptomatic on 22 January and was confirmed on 27 January. Case 3 got sick on 25 January and was confirmed on 30 January. Case 4 had illness onset on 20 January and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 5 got sick on 23 January and was confirmed on 31 January. Among the 5 cases, case 2 died and the illness of other cases were effectively controlled. After exclusion of other common exposure factors, case 1 had a 6-hour meeting with case 2 and case 3 on 19 January. Case 2 and case 3 might be infected by case 1 during the incubation period. It is the key point for epidemiological investigation. Conclusion: The epidemiological investigation indicates that the transmission might occur in the incubation period of COVID-19 case, close attention should be paid to it in future COVID-19 prevention and control.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, W J; Gao, Q; Jin, K; Gong, X H; Han, R B; Jiang, C Y; Jiang, X J; Jin, B H; Fang, Q W; Pan, H; Wu, H Y; Sun, X D","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200302-00236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incubation period of initial case","confirmed COVID","cases","epidemiological investigation","incubation period of COVID","epidemiological link","epidemiological characteristics","transmission chain","future COVID","field epidemiological survey","Multi prevention","Control Protocol","control measures","common exposure factors","common environmental exposure","close attention","illness onset","screening close contacts","medical isolation observation","nCoV","National Health Commission","Coronavirus Disease","real time RT-PCR","cluster","infection source","hour meeting","Nasopharyngeal swabs","sputum samples","Edition","exclusion","key point","detection","Objective","Conclusion","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

A safety consideration for the application of chloroquine is its QTc-prolonging potential. Thus far, no data are available on the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19. The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation. Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples t-test. RESULTS A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35 ms (95% CI 28-43 ms) using computerised interpretation and 34 ms (95% CI 25-43 ms) using manual interpretation. No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment. After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment. None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter. This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Broek, M P H; M\u00F6hlmann, J E; Abeln, B G S; Liebregts, M; van Dijk, V F; van de Garde, E M W","journal":"Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-020-01429-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350818/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["degree of chloroquine","QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine","application of chloroquine","chloroquine therapy","CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine","initiation of chloroquine treatment","ms","treatment of infected patients","prolonged QTc interval","induced QTc prolongation","mean QTc prolongation","follow-up QTc intervals","baseline ECG","ECG recording","manual interpretation","ECG monitoring","hospitalised COVID","computerised interpretation","baseline electrocardiogram","manual review","CI","new potential therapeutic option","ECGs","SARS-CoV","paired samples t-test","battle","pandemic","safety consideration","METHODS","relevant matter","need","pointes","BACKGROUND","data","torsade","OBJECTIVE","total"],"language":"en"},

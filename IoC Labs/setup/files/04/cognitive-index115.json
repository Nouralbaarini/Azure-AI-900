A large set of data collected at a worldwide scale during the first months of 2020 is compiled into series of semi-logarithmic plots, for a selection of thirty-two countries from the five continents. Three regimes are identified in the propagation of an epidemic wave: a pre-epidemic regime 1, an exponential-growth regime 2, and a resorption regime 3. A two-parameters scaling of the first-wave death variation reported in China is used to fit those reported in other countries. Comparison is made between the propagation of the pandemic in different countries, which are classified in four groups, from group A where the pandemic first waves were contained efficiently, to group D where the pandemic first waves widely spread. Group A is mainly composed of Asian countries, where fast and efficient measures have been applied. Group D is composed of Western-Europe countries and the United States of America, where late decisions and confused political communication (pandemic seriousness, protection masks, herd immunity etc.) led to significant death tolls. The threat of large resurging epidemic waves after a hasty lockdown lift is discussed, in particular for the countries from group D, where the number of contagious people remained high in the beginning of May 2020. The situation is opposite in Asian countries from group A, where the number of contagious people was successfully maintained to a low level.

At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gong, Jiao; Ou, Jingyi; Qiu, Xueping; Jie, Yusheng; Chen, Yaqiong; Yuan, Lianxiong; Cao, Jing; Tan, Mingkai; Xu, Wenxiong; Zheng, Fang; Shi, Yaling; Hu, Bo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5f13718a22acb1f72d7baad5d96db8c673f087c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCA","CICA","RDW"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe disease","non-severe COVID","probability of severe COVID","non-severe group","non-severe state","early treatment of severe patients","critical COVID","Background Severe cases of coronavirus disease","infected patients","tuberculosis disease","calibration curve","train cohort","chronic respiratory disease","high risk of progression","risk prediction","clinical impact curve analysis","discriminative ability of nomogram","coronary heart disease","following basic disease","Decision curve analysis","high clinical net benefit","clinical applicability","high diagnostic accuracy","early identifying cases","reliable risk stratification tool","high short-term mortality rates","respiratory failure","RDW","DCA","AUC","demographic","sensitivity","CICA","admission","specificity","acute respiratory distress","optimal agreement","laboratory data","Wuhan city","Guangzhou city","effective model","baseline data","predictive accuracy","important role","role of RBC","blood urea nitrogen","logistic regression model","independent validation cohorts","optimal use of medical resources","red blood cell distribution width","LASSO","coefficient of variation","serum lactate dehydrogenase","better centralized management","hypertension","diabetes","C-reactive protein","selection operator","algorithm","absolute shrinkage","centers","patient prioritization","direct bilirubin","distinguishing individuals","serological indicators","albumin","area","Methods SARS-CoV","actual observation","China","clinicians","hospitalization","present","Interpretation","Findings","days","features"],"language":"en"},

We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can\u0027t be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xiuli; Hewings, Geoffrey J.D.; Wang, Shouyang; Qin, Minghui; Xiang, Xin; Zheng, Shan; Li, Xuefeng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebfdcdc6495fec3c91cab1eb88b2ad557391722d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033498","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["time quarantine measures","QSEIR model","appropriate anti-epidemic measures","mainland China","unprecedented strict quarantine measures","epidemic outbreaks","peak date","model parameters","quarantine-susceptible","end date","real date","quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments","stochastic simulation","sensitive analysis","long-term simulation result","peak value of confirmed cases","countries","range","best simulation test result","different containment strategies","published information","prediction error","published studies","main results","different parameter choices","effective containment strategy","statistical method","negative short-term public","outcomes","sensitivity","production","observed values","infectious-resistant","economic consequences","cured rate","stage","regions","days","vaccination","special medicine","estimates","development trend","world","study","paper","period","probability","March18"],"language":"en"},

Most recent estimates of Rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7701711485f822c0f43df58b48faf6a433028c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027649","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Princess Cruises Ship"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["values","secondary outbreak","outbreak of COVID","mean estimates","recent estimates of Rt","Diamond Princess Ship","Princess Cruises Ship","transmission potential","mean reproduction number","community-level transmission dynamics","China","Japanese government","Singapore","confined setting","time-series incidence data","trajectory","mathematical modeling","enhanced quarantine control","early phase","passengers","novel coronavirus","epidemic threshold","approximate range","crew members","course","findings"],"language":"en"},

Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC\u002BAZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented. RESULTS: A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC\u002BAZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC\u002BAZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC\u002BAZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC\u002BAZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC\u002BAZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magagnoli, Joseph; Narendran, Siddharth; Pereira, Felipe; Cummings, Tammy; Hardin, James W; Sutton, S Scott; Ambati, Jayakrishna","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77716eaa4179ab9ca26b4e6ebc67e668a12cd116.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20065920v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Food and Drug Administration","United States Veterans Health Administration","HC AZ","HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HC groups","AZ group","patients","adjusted hazard ratio","risk of death","risk of ventilation","Covid","use of hydroxychloroquine","risk of mechanical ventilation","competing risk hazard regression","Rates of death","Rates of ventilation","azithromycin","subdistribution hazard ratios","primary outcomes","Drug Administration","emergency use","limited observational evidence","clinical characteristics","clinical trials","competing risks","conflicting data","retrospective analysis of data","results of ongoing prospective","association of increased overall mortality","United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers","infection","addition","account","treatments","controlled studies","standard supportive management","confirmed SARS-CoV","need","cause","widespread adoption","therapy","propensity scores","drugs","importance","Food","exposure","METHODS","study","BACKGROUND","Discharge","total","combination","CONCLUSIONS","findings"],"language":"en"},

Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stem from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies.

More than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been confirmed. While PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis, high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. Methods. A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Findings. Fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subject, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects. Interpretation. Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through-put of samples/day. Funding.

The health and socioeconomic factors associated with delay in implementation of NPIs was analyzed using fractional logit and probit models, and beta regression models. The probability of timely NPI implementation by a country was analyzed using a probit model. The effects of these interventions on mobility changes using Google social mobility reports, were analyzed with propensity score matching methods. Three NPIs were analyzed: national school closure, national lockdown, and global travel ban. Countries with higher incomes, larger populations, and better health preparedness measures had greater delays in implementation. Countries with greater population density, more democratic political systems, lower case detection capacity, and later arrival of first cases were more likely to implement NPIs. Implementation of lockdowns significantly reduced physical mobility. Mobility was further reduced when lockdowns were enforced with curfews or fines, or were more strictly defined. National school closures did not significantly change mobility.

We simulated SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing to estimate the frequency of testing needed to avert continued epidemic propagation as shelter-in-place orders are relaxed. We find that testing strategies less frequent than twice weekly (e.g. weekly testing or testing once prior to returning to work) are unlikely to prevent workforce outbreaks.

Deletion analysis showed that efficient internal initiation required a segment of the HCV genome extending from about nucleotides 40-370 and that deletions from the 3\u0027-end of this element were highly deleterious. As the authentic initiation codon for HCV polyprotein synthesis is at nucleotide 342, this demonstrates that, besides 5\u0027-UTR sequences, a short length of HCV coding sequences is required for internal initiation. This finding was confirmed in transfection assays of BT7-H cells and was shown to be independent of the nature of the downstream reporter cistron. The strong requirement for coding sequences is in sharp contrast to internal initiation of picornavirus RNA translation. As a probable correlate with this, it was also found that the efficiency of internal initiation was only marginally compromised when the authentic initiation codon was mutated to a non-AUG codon, again in sharp contrast with the picornaviruses. The finding that coding sequences are required for internal initiation has important implications for the design of experiments to test for internal initiation of translation of cellular mRNAs.","publish_time":"1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, J E; Kaminski, A; Kettinen, H J; Grace, K; Clarke, B E; Carroll, A R; Rowlands, D J; Jackson, R J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC394721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["internal initiation of translation","efficient internal initiation","efficiency of internal initiation","authentic initiation codon","internal initiation of picornavirus RNA translation","insertion of HCV sequences","short length of HCV coding sequences","HCV genome","UTR sequences","mechanism of internal ribosome entry","HCV polyprotein synthesis","sharp contrast","downstream cistron","finding","downstream reporter cistron","hepatitis C virus","testing","important implications","design of experiments","cistrons","segment","transfection assays of BT7","H cells","dicistronic mRNA","rabbit reticulocyte lysates","nature","Deletion analysis","cellular mRNAs","strong requirement","end","question","nucleotides","element","deletions","picornaviruses","probable correlate"],"language":"en"},

Analyses of its mRNAs showed that these late RNAs, unlike all other characterized late mRNAs of poxviruses, are uniform in length.

Furthermore, these 5\u0027-terminal poly(A) sequences are not complementary to the corresponding region of the template strand of the viral DNA. Instead, the nucleotide sequences of the mRNA and the viral DNA diverge at the site of the three As in the sequence 5\u0027-TAAATG-3\u0027 containing the gene\u0027s initiation codon.

Their biosynthesis was studied in vivo using lines of cultured rat hepatocytes (clone 9) and pituitary cells (GH 3.1) and in cell-free synthesis experiments. In vitro translation of mRNA extracted from free and bound polysomes of clone 9 cells demonstrated that ribophorins are made exclusively on bound polysomes. The primary translation products of ribophorin messengers obtained from cultured hepatocytes or from regenerating livers co-migrated with the respective mature proteins, but had slightly higher apparent molecular weights (2,000) than the unglycosylated forms immunoprecipitated from cells treated with tunicamycin. This indicates that ribophorins, in contrast to all other endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins previously studied, contain transient amino-terminal insertion signals which are removed co-translationally. Kinetic and pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine and [3H]mannose demonstrated that ribophorins are not subjected to electrophoretically detectable posttranslational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage or trimming and terminal glycosylation of oligosaccharide side chain(s). Direct analysis of the oligosaccharides of ribophorin l showed that they do not contain the terminal sugars characteristic of complex oligosaccharides and that they range in composition from Man8GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc. These findings, as well as the observation that the mature proteins are sensitive to endoglycosidase H and insensitive to endoglycosidase D, are consistent with the notion that the biosynthetic pathway of the ribophorins does not require a stage of passage through the Golgi apparatus.","publish_time":"1984-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a3ac4ed56c42714b04e97e0e5e11a93c5a91508.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2113407/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ribophorins","cultured hepatocytes","endoglycosidase H","respective mature proteins","endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins","oligosaccharides of ribophorin","bound polysomes of clone","pituitary cells","terminal sugars characteristic of complex oligosaccharides","terminal glycosylation of oligosaccharide","rough endoplasmic reticulum","endoglycosidase D","lines of cultured rat hepatocytes","cell-free synthesis experiments","translation of mRNA","transient amino-terminal insertion signals","primary translation products of ribophorin messengers","transmembrane glycoproteins characteristic","pulse-chase experiments","regenerating livers co-migrated","proteolytic cleavage","electrophoretically detectable posttranslational modifications","notion","higher apparent molecular weights","chain","observation","methionine","contrast","stage of passage","biosynthetic pathway","Golgi apparatus","composition","unglycosylated forms","Direct analysis","mannose","Man8GlcNAc","Man5GlcNAc","tunicamycin","binding of ribosomes","findings","biosynthesis"],"language":"en"},

The structural glycoprotein, VP7, a 38-kD integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably transfers to virus in this process. The gene for VP7 potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids which has two tandem hydrophobic domains at the NH2-terminal, each preceded by an in- frame ATG codon. A series of deletion mutants constructed from a full- length cDNA clone of the Simian 11 rotavirus VP7 gene were expressed in COS 7 cells. Products from wild-type, and mutants which did not affect the second hydrophobic domain of VP7, were localized by immunofluorescence to elements of the ER only. However, deletions affecting the second hydrophobic domain (mutants 42-61, 43-61, 47-61) showed immunofluorescent localization of VP7 which coincided with that of wheat germ agglutinin, indicating transport to the Golgi apparatus. Immunoprecipitable wild-type protein, or an altered protein lacking the first hydrophobic sequence, remained intracellular and endo-beta-N- acetylglucosaminidase H sensitive. In contrast, products of mutants 42- 61, 43-61, and 47-61 were transported from the ER, and secreted. Glycosylation of the secreted molecules was inhibited by tunicamycin, resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and therefore of the N-linked complex type. An unglycosylated version of VP7 was also secreted. We suggest that the second hydrophobic domain contributes to a positive signal for ER location and a membrane anchor function. Secretion of the mutant glycoprotein implies that transport can be constitutive with the destination being dictated by an overriding compartmentalization signal.","publish_time":"1985-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c838ca724d9916867c83ad89c823ca61027bd046.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2113985/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hydrophobic domain of VP7","rotavirus VP7 gene","hydrophobic sequence","products of mutants","immunofluorescent localization of VP7","unglycosylated version of VP7","altered protein","Immunoprecipitable wild-type protein","ER location","tandem hydrophobic domains","kD integral membrane protein","endo-beta","N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion","N- acetylglucosaminidase H sensitive","transport","complex type","series of deletion mutants","secreted molecules","rough endoplasmic reticulum","membrane anchor function","positive signal","mutant glycoprotein","structural glycoprotein","overriding compartmentalization signal","buds","Simian","non-enveloped reovirus","tunicamycin","amino acids","length cDNA clone","destination","wheat germ agglutinin","NH2-terminal","immunofluorescence","Golgi apparatus","frame ATG codon","Secretion","cells","Glycosylation","elements","contrast","deletions","process"],"language":"en"},

The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation- competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the connexins. Variable amounts of similar connexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression. These results demonstrate that the connexins contain a cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site that can be processed by this enzyme in vitro and in vivo in association with their membrane insertion. Consequently, a specific factor or condition must be required to prevent this aberrant processing of connexins under normal conditions in the cell.","publish_time":"1994-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8acd6f32fca98b572ad9c5cce743dd21d26b115e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Connexins"],"organizations":["ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["length connexins","different connexins","aberrant processing of connexins","Endogenous unprocessed connexins","polytopic plasma membrane","plasma membrane bilayer","pancreatic microsomes","signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion","pancreatic ER-derived microsomes","presence of microsomes","proteins","cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site","cleavage reaction","unprecedented processing","translation- competent cell lysates","efficient proteolytic processing","eucaryotic cell types","ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells","competent recipient","Variable amounts of similar connexin cleavage products","amino terminus","amino-terminal portion","gap junction channels","removal","PM","normal conditions","analysis","cytoplasm","subcellular distribution","times","association","microsome concentration","specific factor","level of protein expression","addition","synthesis","enzyme","results"],"language":"en"},

A Core-2 branch can also be formed from core-1 by the core-2 \u03B21,6 N-acetyl-d-glucosamine transferase (\u03B21,6 GlcNAc T) that leads to chain extension. Increased levels of the \u03B12,3 SAT (O) and decreased levels of the core-2 \u03B21,6 GlcNAc T are seen in breast cancer cells and correlate with differences in the structure of the O-glycans synthesized (Brockhausen et al., 1995; Lloyd et al., 1996). Since in mucin type O-glycosylation sugars are added individually and sequentially in the Golgi apparatus, the position of the transferases, as well as their activity, can determine the final structure of the O-glycans synthesized. A cDNA coding for the human \u03B12,3 SAT (O) tagged with an immunoreactive epitope from the myc gene has been used to map the position of the glycosyltransferase in nontumorigenic (MTSV1-7) and malignant (T47D) breast epithelial cell lines. Transfectants were analyzed for expression of the enzyme at the level of message and protein, as well as for enzymic activity. In T47D cells, which do not express core-2 \u03B21,6 GlcNAc T, the increased activity of the sialyltransferase correlated with increased sialylation of core-1 O-glycans on the epithelial mucin MUC1. Furthermore, in MTSV1-7 cells, which do express core-2 \u03B21,6 GlcNAc T, an increase in sialylated core-1 structures is accompanied by a reduction in the ratio of GlcNAc: GalNAc in the O-glycans attached to MUC1, implying a decrease in branching. Using quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, the sialyltransferase was mapped to the medial- and trans-Golgi cisternae, with some being present in the TGN. The data represent the first fine mapping of a sialyltransferase specifically active in O-glycosylation and demonstrate that the structure of O-glycans synthesized by a cell can be manipulated by transfecting with recombinant glycosyltransferases.","publish_time":"1997-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whitehouse, Caroline; Burchell, Joy; Gschmeissner, Stephen; Brockhausen, Inka; Lloyd, Kenneth O.; Taylor-Papadimitriou, Joyce","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46c58d9482fd8d00108402c45033131561eb8921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2132526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2132526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-glycans","structure of O","express core","sialylated core","GlcNAc T","increased sialylation of core","sialyltransferase","mucin type O-glycosylation sugars","ratio of GlcNAc","increased activity","T47D cells","Increased levels","human \u03B12","epithelial mucin MUC1","breast cancer cells","GalNAc","final structure","enzymic activity","position","chain extension","MTSV1","breast epithelial cell lines","N-acetyld","decreased levels","Golgi apparatus","trans-Golgi cisternae","d-glucosamine transferase","Gal\u03B21","differences","transfer of sialic acid","fine mapping","structures","immunoreactive epitope","galactosamine","level of message","expression","protein","enzyme","myc gene","transfecting","nontumorigenic","quantitative immunoelectron microscopy","cDNA coding","reduction","Brockhausen","recombinant glycosyltransferases","data","branching","Transfectants","Lloyd","TGN"],"language":"en"},

Central to the budding process is the myristoylated viral core protein precursor Gag which, even in the absence of all other viral components, is capable of associating with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and assembling into extracellular virus- like particles. In this paper we have used heterologous, Semliki Forest virus-driven, expression of M-MuLV Gag to study the mechanism by which this protein is targeted to the cell surface. In pulse-chase experiments, BFA, monensin, and 20 degrees C block did not affect incorporation of Gag into extracellular particles thereby indicating that the secretory pathway is not involved in targeting of Gag to the cell surface. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that newly synthesized Gag became rapidly and efficiently associated with membranes which had a density similar to that of plasma membrane- derived vesicles. Protease-protection studies confirmed that the Gag- containing membranes were of plasma membrane origin, since in crude cell homogenates, the bulk of newly synthesized Gag was protease- resistant as expected of a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Taken together these data indicate that targeting of M-MuLV Gag to the cell surface proceeds via direct insertion of the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, since the membrane insertion reaction is highly efficient and specific, this suggests that the reaction is dependent on as-yet-unidentified cellular factors.","publish_time":"1996-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed836dbe62d537006fc207428b489d208836a949.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2133957/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MuLV Gag","synthesized Gag","targeting of Gag","incorporation of Gag","plasma membrane origin","membrane insertion reaction","cell surface proceeds","plasma membrane- derived vesicles","myristoylated viral core protein precursor Gag","cytoplasmic leaflet","extracellular virus","crude cell homogenates","extracellular particles","membranes","Semliki Forest virus","Protease-protection studies","viral components","direct insertion","budding process","protease- resistant","Retrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus","Subcellular fractionation studies","monensin","bulk","BFA","capable of associating","expression","degrees C block","density similar","pulse-chase experiments","secretory pathway","absence","mechanism","unidentified cellular factors","paper","data"],"language":"en"},

We took advantage of a temperature-sensitive mutant in PMA1, encoding the plasma membrane ATPase, in which newly synthesized Pma1 is mislocalized to the vacuole via the endosome. Diversion of mutant Pma1 from vacuolar delivery and rerouting to the plasma membrane is a major mechanism of suppression of pma1(ts). 16 independent suppressor of pma1 (sop) mutants were isolated. Identification of the corresponding genes reveals eight that are identical with VPS genes required for delivery of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins. A second group of SOP genes participates in vacuolar delivery of mutant Pma1 but is not essential for delivery of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y. Because the biosynthetic pathway to the vacuole intersects with the endocytic pathway, internalization of a bulk membrane endocytic marker FM 4-64 was assayed in the sop mutants. By this means, defective endosome-to-vacuole trafficking was revealed in a subset of sop mutants. Another subset of sop mutants displays perturbed trafficking between endosome and Golgi: impaired pro-\u03B1 factor processing in these strains was found to be due to defective recycling of the trans-Golgi protease Kex2. One of these strains defective in Kex2 trafficking carries a mutation in SOP2, encoding a homologue of mammalian synaptojanin (implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling). Thus, cell surface delivery of mutant Pma1 can occur as a consequence of disturbances at several different sites in the endosomal system.","publish_time":"1997-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Wen-jie; Chang, Amy","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1863b855d1e87b1a2b85a88c71c0b8753619f0b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2138039.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2138039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VPS","SOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vacuolar delivery of mutant Pma1","synthesized Pma1","Diversion of mutant Pma1","subset of sop mutants","cell surface delivery of mutant Pma1","group of SOP genes","vacuole trafficking","independent suppressor of pma1","defective endosome","Kex2 trafficking","corresponding genes","VPS genes","defective recycling","strains defective","vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase","synthesized vacuolar proteins","perturbed trafficking","plasma membrane ATPase","endocytic pathway","temperature-sensitive mutant","trans-Golgi protease Kex2","yeast endosomal system","bulk membrane endocytic marker FM","biosynthetic pathway","impaired pro-\u03B1 factor processing","internalization","major mechanism of suppression","different sites","SOP2","mutation","homologue of mammalian synaptojanin","synaptic vesicle endocytosis","consequence of disturbances","advantage","novel genetic selection","Identification"],"language":"en"},

Further studies using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion proteins suggest that two hydrophilic sequences on either side of the hydrophobic domain play an important role in ER targeting.","publish_time":"1994-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c6ed103b79757989428ac0f837b7a69f0d62b86.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290952/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

The hybridoma was first produced by fusing spleen cells from BALB/C mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2/O-Ag14 mutant myeloma cells. The mAb is produced and purified using multistep ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography protocols. T10B9 has been used successfully to treat acute cellular rejection in renal transplantation and as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Because T10B9 is nonmitogenic and causes minimal cytokine release, both treatment of rejection and induction of immunosuppression were accomplished with significantly fewer and milder untoward effects (cytokine release syndrome) than its comparator OKT3. Since T10B9 is directed against the \u03B1\u03B2 heterodimer of the CD3 epitope, it spares the gamma delta (\u03B3\u03B4) region. These gamma delta (\u03B3\u03B4) T cells have a unique role in the immune response controlling many serious human diseases and perhaps facilitating the development of immunologic tolerance. T10B9 has a relatively short duration of action, depleting T cells for only 10 to 14 days, unlike the protracted depletion seen with thymoglobulin and Campath-1H. There is no B-lymphocyte depletion with T10B9 as there is with both of the aforementioned reagents. The lack of prolonged lymphocyte depletion may account for less infection observed with T10B9 treatment.","publish_time":"2009-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waid, Thomas H; Thompson, John S; Siemionow, Maria; Brown, Stephen A","journal":"Drug Des Devel Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f01702c71fa172be560638b826441239c956227.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2769243.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T10B9 treatment","depleting T cells","spleen cells","induction of immunosuppression","T-lymphocyte receptor complex","\u03B1\u03B2 heterodimer","treatment of rejection","gamma delta","\u03B3\u03B4","protracted depletion","mAb","B-lymphocyte depletion","human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes","lack of prolonged lymphocyte depletion","cytokine release syndrome","minimal cytokine release","immunosuppression induction agent","O-Ag14 mutant myeloma cells","renal transplantation","nonmitogenic immunoglobulin","serious human diseases","acute cellular rejection","simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation","SP2","C mice","heart","multistep ion exchange","immune response","kappa murine monoclonal antibody","milder untoward effects","molecular sieve chromatography protocols","unique role","short duration of action","fewer","BALB","CD3 epitope","infection","comparator OKT3","alpha-beta","thymoglobulin","Campath","region","days","MEDI","development of immunologic tolerance","aforementioned reagents","hybridoma"],"language":"en"},

The virus is still circulating in the world. The abnormal thoracic computerized tomographic (CT) scan findings vary widely among the studies of 2009 H1N1 influenza. We evaluated the thoracic CT findings in patients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection to describe findings compared to previously reported findings, and to suggest patterns that may be suggestive for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in an appropriate clinical setting. METHODS: Retrospectively, the archive of all patients with a diagnosis of 2009 H1N1 influenza A were reviewed, in Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, central Iran, between September 23(rd) 2009 to February 20(th) 2010. Out of 216 patients with confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, 26 cases with abnormal CT were enrolled in the study. Radiologic findings were characterized by the type and pattern of opacities and zonal distribution. RESULTS: Patchy infiltration (34.6%), lobar consolidation (30.8%), and interstitial infiltration (26.9%) with airbronchogram (38.5%) were the predominant findings in our patients. Bilateral distribution was seen in 80.8% of the patients. Only one patient (3.8%) showed ground-glass opacity, predominant radiographic finding in the previous reports and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). CONCLUSIONS: The most common thoracic CT findings in pandemic H1N1 were patchy infiltration, lobar consolidation, and interstitial infiltration with airbronchogram and bilateral distribution. While these findings can be associated with other infections; they may be suggestive to 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in the appropriate clinical setting. Various radiographic patterns can be seen in thoracic CT scans of the influenza patients.

METHODS: The prevalence of birth defects in perinatal infants delivered after 28 weeks or more was analyzed in Hubei surveillance hospitals during 200l\u20132008. RESULTS: The incidence of birth defects in perinatal infants from 200l to 2008 was 120.0 per 10,000 births, and was increased by about 41% from 81. 1 in 2001 to 138.5 per 10,000 births in 2008. The incidence in the first 4 years (2005\u20132008) was much higher than the latter four (2001\u20132004) (\u03C7(2)=77.64, P \u003C0.05). The difference in prevalence between urban and rural was of no significance in 2008 (\u03C7(2)=0.03, P \u003E0.05), but that between male and female was significant (\u03C7(2)=5.24, P \u003C0.05), as the former prevalence was much higher.

METHODS: B6 mice were subconjunctivally injected with LiCl in contrast to appropriate control sodium chloride (NaCl), and then routinely infected with PA. Clinical score, slit-lamp photography, hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) staining, and bacterial plate counts were used to determine the role of LiCl in PA keratitis. Messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in PA-challenged mouse corneas and in vitro cultured macrophages and neutrophils were measured with real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Apoptosis of the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the PA-infected murine corneas was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining and propidium iodide staining associated with flow cytometry. In cultured murine macrophages and neutrophils, cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V/propidium iodide double staining associated with flow cytometry and western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. RESULTS: Treatment with LiCl reduced the severity of corneal disease by reducing corneal inflammatory response and bacterial burden. Moreover, LiCl increased anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 levels, decreased proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 levels, and enhanced apoptosis of infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in the PA-infected mouse corneas. In vitro studies further confirmed that LiCl elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression but reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in murine macrophages and neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a protective role of LiCl in PA keratitis. LiCl promotes host resistance against PA infection by suppressing inflammatory responses, enhancing inflammatory cell apoptosis, and promoting bacterial clearance.","publish_time":"2013-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Kang; Wu, Yongjian; Zhu, Min; Deng, Qiuchan; Nie, Xinxin; Li, Meiyu; Wu, Minhao; Huang, Xi","journal":"Mol Vis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7e3179a2dbf9f386ac702c0a6fc780889773829.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3716469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted, with a sample size of 523 paediatric patients, diagnosed with an URTI during the period of June 2003 to 22 June 2005. The study was conducted at five Primary Health Care Facilities in North Trinidad. RESULTS: The three most frequent URTIs diagnosed were non-specific URTI, common cold, and acute tonsillitis in rank order. Four patterns of prescribing were identified, (1) no drug therapy [1.9%]; (2) antibiotic therapy alone [6.1%]; (3) antibiotic and symptomatic therapy [53.0%]; and (4) symptomatic therapy alone [39.0%]. The, most frequently prescribed antibiotics were penicillins (amoxicillin [46.3%] and amoxicillin/clavulanate [5.3%]) and a macrolide (erythromycin [6.1%]). The three symptomatic agents most frequently prescribed were paracetamol [40.1%]; diphenhydramine [29.1%]; and normal saline nasal drops [14.2%]. In 112 cases with swab analyses done, of these, 98.2% revealed a growth of commensals only, while 1.8% grew pathogenic micro-organisms. Of the cases showing commensal growth only, 84.6% were treated with an antibiotic, 14.5% were treated with symptomatic agents alone and 0.9% received no drug therapy at all. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of paediatric patients diagnosed with an URTI in North Trinidad was prescribed antibiotics although not indicated The inappropriate use of antibiotics can potentiate the worldwide trend of antimicrobial resistance.","publish_time":"2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mungrue, Kameel; Brown, Tessa; Hayes, Ivory; Ramroop, Savatri; Thurston, Portio; Pereira, Lexley PINTO","journal":"Pharm Pract (Granada)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d212d002cb2b3bd66d6633aea1cc8c816be9c114.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4139753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North Trinidad"],"keyphrases":["symptomatic therapy","antibiotic therapy","prescribed antibiotics","drug therapy","North Trinidad","symptomatic agents","non-specific URTI","large proportion of paediatric patients","patterns of prescribing","amoxicillin","cases","inappropriate use of antibiotics","prescribing patterns of physicians","commensal growth","growth of commensals","retrospective observational study","upper respiratory tract infections","acute tonsillitis","Primary Health Care Facilities","frequent URTIs","paracetamol","worldwide trend of antimicrobial resistance","rank order","sample size","normal saline nasal drops","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","appropriateness of drugs","penicillins","RESULTS","swab analyses","OBJECTIVE","macrolide","erythromycin","pathogenic micro-organisms","diphenhydramine","clavulanate","period"],"language":"en"},

Using the guinea pig model, we demonstrated that transmission of influenza A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus through the air is efficient, compared with spread through contaminated environmental surfaces (fomites). We also examined the aerosol transmission efficiencies of 2 human influenza virus A strains and found that A/Panama/2007/1999 influenza virus transmitted more efficiently than A/Texas/36/1991 (H1N1) virus in our model.

Mathematical modeling can be utilized to forecast the final numbers as well as the endpoint of the disease in India and its states, as well as assess the impact of social distancing measures. In the present work, the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model have been implemented to predict the endpoint of COVID-19 in India as well as three states accounting for over 55% of the total cases - Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi. The results using the SIR model indicate that the disease will reach an endpoint in India on 12 September, while Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi will reach endpoints on 20 August, 30 July and 9 September respectively. Using the Logistic Regression model, the endpoint for India is predicted on 23 July, while that for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi is 5 July, 23 June and 10 August respectively. It is also observed that the case numbers predicted by the SIR model are greater than those for the Logistic Growth model in each case. The results suggest that the lockdown enacted by the Government of India has had only a moderate impact on the spread of COVID-19, and emphasize the need for firm implementation of social distancing guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malhotra, B.; Kashyap, V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dff919470251a88a01fbdb0b4d947453ae93350.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20103028v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","Gujarat","Maharashtra","Delhi"],"keyphrases":["SIR model","Logistic Growth model","Government of India","endpoint of COVID","Logistic Regression model","Gujarat","disease","Delhi","case numbers","total cases - Maharashtra","spread of COVID","results","impact of social distancing measures","moderate impact","final numbers","confirmed cases","states accounting","firm implementation of social distancing guidelines","widespread public health crisis","recent history","Susceptible-Infected","need","present work","lockdown","endpoints","Mathematical modeling"],"language":"en"},

To gauge such response, we assessed service availability and Infection prevention and control (IPC) status in 110 hospitals situated across seven provinces. An electronic survey was sent out to the frontline clinicians working on those hospitals between 24th March and 7th April 2020; one response per hospital was analyzed. Hospitals were divided into small, medium, and large based on the total number of beds (small:\u003C=15; medium:16-50; large:\u003E50), and further categorized into public, private, and mixed based on the ownership. Out of 110 hospitals, 81% (22/27) of small, 39% (11/28) of medium, and 33% (18/55) of large hospitals had not allocated isolation beds for COVID-19 suspects. All small, majority of medium (89%; 25/28), and 50% of large hospitals did not have a functional intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of study. Nasopharyngeal (NP)/throat swab kits were available in one-third (35/110), whereas viral transport media (VTM), portable fridge box, and refrigerator were available in one-fifth (20%) of hospitals. Only one hospital (large/tertiary) had a functional PCR machine. Except for General practitioners, other health cadres- crucial during pandemics, were low in number. On IPC measures, the supplies of simple face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers were adequate in the majority of hospitals, however, N95-respirators, Filter masks, and PPE-suits were grossly lacking. Government COVID-19 support was unevenly distributed across provinces; health facilities in Province 2, Gandaki, and Province 5 received fewer resources than others. Our findings alert the Nepalese and other governments to act early and proactively during health emergencies and not wait until the disease disrupts their health systems. Other countries of similar economic levels may undertake similar surveys to measure and improve their pandemic response.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattarai, S.; Dhungana, J.; Ensor, T.; Shrestha, U.

We present a novel method that enables us to make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier stage compared to other available methods.

The mortality of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is unacceptably high and new strategies are urgently needed to rapidly identify and treat patients at risk for organ failure. Clinical epidemiologic studies demonstrate that vulnerability to organ failure is greatest after viral clearance from the upper airway, which suggests that dysregulation of the host immune response is a critical mediator of clinical deterioration and death. Autopsy and pre-clinical evidence implicate aberrant complement activation in endothelial injury and organ failure. A potential therapeutic strategy warranting investigation is to inhibit complement, with case reports of successful treatment of COVID-19 with inhibitors of complement. However, this approach requires careful balance between the host protective and potential injurious effects of complement activation, and biomarkers to identify the optimal timing and candidates for therapy are lacking. Here we report the presence of complement activation products on circulating erythrocytes from hospitalized COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry. These findings suggest that novel erythrocyte-based diagnostics provide a method to identify patients with dysregulated complement activation.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, L.

Even in Japan, epidemiological linkage of transmission was probably lost already by February 18, 2020. From that time, it has been necessary to detect clusters using syndromic surveillance. Method We identified common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, we constructed a model to predict the number of patients with antipyretic analgesics (AP) and multi-ingredient cold medications (MIC) controlling well-known pediatric infectious diseases including influenza or RS virus infection. To do so, we used the National Official Sentinel Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NOSSID), even though NOSSID data are weekly data with 10 day delays, on average. The probability of a cluster with unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms is a product of the probabilities of aberrations in AP and MIC, which is defined as one minus the probability of the number of patients prescribed a certain type of drug in PS compared to the number predicted using a model. This analysis was conducted prospectively in 2020 using data from October 1, 2010 through 2019 by prefecture and by age-class. Results The probability of unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptom cluster was estimated as less than 60% in 2020. Discussion The most severe limitation of the present study is that the proposed model cannot be validated. A large outbreak of an unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms must be experienced, at which time, practitioners will have to wing it. We expect that no actual cluster of unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms will occur, but if it should occur, we hope to detect it.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ueno, Tomoaki; Kurita, Junko; Sugawara, Tamie; Sugishita, Yoshiyuki; Ohkusa, Yasushi; Kawanohara, Hirokazu; Kamei, Miwako","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e829557e8821ad7a70e6d3d445a2d20f69607784.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.11.20061697v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIC","National Official Sentinel Surveillance for Infectious Diseases","NOSSID","AP","PS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","probability of unknown febrile disease","actual cluster of unknown febrile disease","respiratory symptom cluster","common symptoms of COVID","number of patients","NOSSID data","weekly data","proposed model","time","well-known pediatric infectious diseases","syndromic surveillance","large outbreak","National Official Sentinel Surveillance","influenza","multi-ingredient cold medications","antipyretic analgesics","present study","RS virus infection","certain type of drug","product","day delays","probabilities of aberrations","severe limitation","PS","fever","Japan","epidemiological linkage of transmission","clusters","Method","prefecture","age-class","Discussion","average","China","Object","practitioners","analysis"],"language":"en"},

While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. We also used reported rates for morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in other regions to estimate risk at the county (Harris County) and census tract levels. Analysis: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. Then, to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. Results: Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45-65 (~4% of County population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. The results of age-based estimations of hospitalization rates showed the western part of the County might be in greater need of hospital beds. However, cross-referencing the vulnerability model with the estimation of potential hospitalized patients showed that part of the County has the least access to medical facilities. Conclusion: Policy makers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiaghadi, A.; Rifai, H.

Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it. Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one. This will require Australia to achieve for transmission rates at least two thirds lower than those seen in the most severely affected countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"McBryde, Emma S; Meehan, Michael T; Trauer, James M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8573e6963125b8842707d449bf5232185042208.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["South Korea","Japan","United States","Australia"],"keyphrases":["Australia","transmission leads","transmission rates","reproduction number","consequent epidemic curves","effective control","aggressive control","recent model","simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID","burden","Italy","South Korea","large reduction","Spain","dramatic differences","small decrease","social distancing interventions","community","cases","Japan","United States","examples","hospitalisations","deaths","UK","thirds lower","overwhelmed health service","world","herd immunity","Methods","affected countries","Background","Models","dynamics","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

Although index infections are rarely observable in nature, experimental inoculations of pathogens into novel host species have a long history in biomedical research. This provides a rich and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen determinants of variability in infection outcomes. Here, we analysed the progressions of 514 experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonotic pathogen which in nature exhibits both dead end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts. Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer to cooler-bodied species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical disease periods, which will also impede transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose and together suggest that increased virulence as host species become more dissimilar is the limiting factor preventing onward transmission. These results explain observed constraints on rabies virus host shifts, allow us to evaluate the risk of novel reservoirs establishing, and give mechanistic insights into why host shifts are less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross-species transmission. Significance statement Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host species. However, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species for reasons that remain poorly understood. Examining cross-species inoculations involving rabies, a widespread viral zoonosis, we show that mismatches in virulence, which are predictable from host and viral factors, make sustained transmission in the novel host less likely. In particular, disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These mechanistic insights help to explain and predict host shift events and highlight meta-analyses of existing experimental inoculation data as a powerful and generalisable approach for understanding the dynamics of index infections in novel species.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mollentze, Nardus; Streicker, Daniel G.; Murcia, Pablo R.; Hampson, Katie; Biek, Roman","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80832ab730af1ffa67f3a3f7ea1a66212fde25f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.033928","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel host species","novel species","new host species results","distant species","infected species","cross-species transmissions","rabies virus host shifts","experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus","novel hosts","host shift events","cooler-bodied species","onward transmission","meta-analyses of experimental infections","experimental inoculations of pathogens","risk of novel reservoirs","dynamics of index infections","progression of infection","varying levels of sustained transmission","diminished virus excretion","single infection","infection dose","disease progression","infection outcomes","outcome of cross","meta-analyses of existing experimental inoculation data","dead end infections","widespread zoonotic pathogen","pathogen determinants of variability","shorter clinical disease periods","index case","mechanistic insights","shorter incubation periods","widespread viral zoonosis","nature exhibits","tractable approach","generalisable approach","viral factors","increased virulence","related hosts","Significance statement Emerging disease epidemics","unexploited data source","long history","observed constraints","complex interactions","limiting factor","mismatches","carnivores","study","biomedical research","outbreak","progressions","effects","bats","reasons"],"language":"en"},

There are currently no vaccines or therapeutic agents proven efficacious to treat COVID-19. So, whether existing approved drugs could be repurposed and used off-label for the treatment of novel COVID-19 disease is being explored. Methods: A thorough literature search was performed to gather information on the pharmacological properties and toxicity of 6 drugs (azithromycin, chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir) proposed to be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Researchers emphasized affinity of these drugs to block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (IKr) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG), their propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization (QT interval) and cause torsade de pointes (TdP). Risk of drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) for these drugs was quantified by comparing six indices used to assess such risk and by querying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database with specific key words. Data are also provided to compare the level of risk for drug-induced LQTS by these drugs to 23 other, well-recognized, torsadogenic compounds. Results: Estimators of LQTS risk levels indicated a very-high or high risk for all COVID-19 repurposed drugs except for azithromycin, although cases of TdP have been reported following the administration of this drug. There was an excellent agreement among the various indices used to assess risk of drug-induced LQTS for the six repurposed drugs and the 23 torsadogenic compounds. Conclusion: The risk-benefit assessment for the use of repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19 is complicated since benefits are currently anticipated, not proven. Mandatory monitoring of the QT interval shall be performed as such monitoring is possible for hospitalized patients or by the use of biodevices for outpatients initiated on these drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turgeon, J.; Michaud, V.; Dow, P.; Al Rihani, S.

We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic \u0022end time\u0022 t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future. However, running estimates of the \u0022end time\u0022 t95 were in a much smaller interval for China (60 - 70 days vs. the actual value of 67). For the US, the values estimated from the data sequences going back two weeks from now range from 70 to 80 days.

As typically used, however, this tool may introduce an inconsistency by assuming that the rate of depletion of a compartment is proportional to the content of that compartment. As mentioned in the seminal SIR work of Kermack and McKendrick, this is an assumption of mathematical convenience rather than realism. As such, it leads to underprediction of the infectious compartment peaks by a factor of about two, a problem of particular importance when dealing with availability of resources during an epidemic. To remedy this problem, we develop the dSIR model structure, comprising a single delay differential equation and associated delay algebraic equations. We show that SIR and dSIR fully agree in assessing stability and long-term values of a population through an epidemic, but differ considerably in the exponential rates of ascent and descent as well as peak values during the epidemic. The novel Pade-SIR structure is also introduced as a approximation of dSIR by ordinary differential equations. We rigorously analyze the properties of these models and present a number of illustrative simulations, particularly in view of the recent coronavirus epidemic.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development, and if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised in the context of other coronaviruses. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not significantly differ according to genera of virus, but does vary according to host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. While ORF10 is only present in the genomes of a subset of coronaviruses, E is essential for virus replication. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. Phylogeny indicates that this is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their origin in bats, rather than something selected for after zoonotic transfer. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Digard, Paul; Lee, Hui Min; Sharp, Colin; Grey, Finn; Gaunt, Eleanor","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b10b1fe010ca0f7e434a38ab07007cf2331436b5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.083816","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Phylogeny"],"organizations":["CpG","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CpG composition","CpG dinucleotides","attenuated SARS-CoV","absence of CpG suppression","strong CpG suppression","emerged SARS-CoV","viral CpG content","higher CpG content","Conservation of CpG motifs","role CpG motifs","Artificial modification of CpG frequency","subset of coronaviruses","virus replication","E genes","ORF10","primary replication site","live attenuated vaccine development","host species","genera of virus","cross-species transmission","genomes of single stranded RNA viruses","valid approach","open reading frame","future strategies","high variation","proxy","Envelope","need","hypothesis","exhibits","tissue tropism","observation relevant","functionality","over-rides","regions","derived trait","origin","bats","Coronaviridae","context","humans","zoonotic transfer","exception","Phylogeny"],"language":"en"},

The advantage of increasing amount of whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 intrigued us to explore the mutation profile across the genome, to check the genome diversity and to investigate the implications of those mutations in protein stability and viral transmission. Four proteins, surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab and ORF8 showed frequent mutations, while envelop, membrane, ORF6 and ORF7a proteins showed conservation in terms of amino acid substitutions. Some of the mutations across different proteins showed co-occurrence, suggesting their functional cooperation in stability, transmission and adaptability. Combined analysis with the frequently mutated residues identified 20 viral variants, among which 12 specific combinations comprised more than 97% of the isolates considered for the analysis. Analysis of protein structure stability of surface glycoprotein mutants indicated viability of specific variants and are more prone to be temporally and spatially distributed across the globe. Similar empirical analysis of other proteins indicated existence of important functional implications of several variants. Analysis of co-occurred mutants indicated their structural and/or functional interaction among different SARS-COV-2 proteins.

PIP-binding motifs of cellular proteins do not exist in viral proteins. Molecular-docking simulations revealed a putative site of PIP binding to poliovirus (PV) 3C protein that was validated using NMR spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site was located on a highly dynamic \u03B1-helix that also functions in RNA binding. Broad PIP-binding activity was observed in solution using a fluorescence polarization assay or in the context of a lipid bilayer using an on-chip, fluorescence assay. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 3C protein-membrane interface revealed PIP clustering and perhaps PIP-dependent conformations. PIP clustering was mediated by interaction with residues that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. We conclude that 3C binding to membranes will be determined by PIP abundance. We suggest that the duality of function observed for 3C may extend to RNA-binding proteins of other viruses. Highlights A viral PIP-binding site identified, validated and characterized PIP-binding site overlaps the known RNA-binding site PIP-binding site clusters PIPs and perhaps regulates conformation and function Duality of PIP- and RNA-binding sites may extend to other viruses In Brief The absence of conventional PIP-binding domains in viral proteins suggests unique structural solutions to this problem. Shengjuler et al. show that a viral RNA-binding site can be repurposed for PIP binding. PIP clustering can be achieved. The nature of the PIP may regulate protein conformation.","publish_time":"2017-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shengjuler, Djoshkun; Chan, Yan Mei; Sun, Simou; Moustafa, Ibrahim M.; Li, Zhen-Lu; Gohara, David W.; Buck, Matthias; Cremer, Paul S.; Boehr, David D.; Cameron, Craig E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05f2c33b6cf918395f8fcd2b261b987e762764e9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/172742","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIP","NMR","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral PIP-binding site","RNA binding","putative site of PIP binding","characterized PIP-binding site","PIP clustering","C binding","PIP abundance","Broad PIP-binding activity","RNA-binding proteins","viral RNA-binding site","known RNA-binding site PIP-binding site clusters PIPs","PIP-binding motifs of cellular proteins","RNA-binding sites","absence of conventional PIP-binding domains","function Duality of PIP","PIP-dependent conformations","viral proteins","viruses","RNA phosphodiester backbone","protein conformation","C protein-membrane interface","membranes","duality of function","fluorescence assay","fluorescence polarization assay","All-atom molecular dynamics simulations","poliovirus","unique structural solutions","context","PV","genome replication","chip","residues","virion assembly","phosphatidylinositol phosphate","lipid bilayer","problem","dynamic \u03B1-helix","interaction","NMR spectroscopy","Shengjuler","nature"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we review the experience of a comprehensive cancer center. Methods: A prospective registry was set up at Institut Curie at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cancer patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 were entered and actively followed for 28 days. Results: Among 9,842 patients treated at Institut Curie between mid-March and early May 2020, 141 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on RT-PCR testing and/or CT-scan. In line with our case-mix, breast cancer (40%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies (both 13%). Patients with active cancer therapy or/and advanced cancer accounted for 88% and 69% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 79% of patients had COVID-19 related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement [\u2264]50% in 90% of patients. Blood count variations and C-reactive protein elevation were the most common laboratory abnormalities. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered in 48% and 7% of patients, respectively. At the time of analysis, 26 patients (18%) have died from COVID-19, and 81 (57%) were cured. Independent prognostic factors at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis associated with death or intensive care unit admission were extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased O2 saturation. Conclusions: COVID-19 incidence and presentation in cancer patients appear to be very similar to those in the general population.

The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19. Methods We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells, B cells and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status. Results ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. Conclusions Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related with age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radzikowska, U.; Ding, M.; Tan, G.; Zhakparov, D.; Peng, Y.; Wawrzyniak, P.; Wang, M.; Li, S.; Morita, H.; Altunbulakli, C.; Reiger, M.; Neumann, AU.; Lunjani, N.; Traidl-Hoffmann, C.; Nadeau, K.; O\u2019Mahony, L.; Akdis, CA.; Sokolowska, M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/658d8397e3226c1c04c1579c7cb60784b580c027.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.090332","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","immune cells","NK cells","B cells","CD147-related genes","range of human cells","higher expression of ACE2","primary human bronchial epithelial cells","co-expression of ACE2","Altered expression","related molecules","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","extensive collection of primary human cells","study gene expression","potential SARS-CoV","adults","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","known comorbidities of COVID","healthy children","distinct age-related expression profile","potential receptors","Results ACE2","disease status","healthy subjects of different age","novel clinical presentations of COVID","bronchial biopsy","skin biopsies","tissues","lesional skin of patients","PBMCs","epithelial sites","epithelial barriers","risk factors","smoking","obesity","CD26","BSG","risk factor status","DPP4","male gender status","RNA sequencing","regulating factors","Background Morbidity","different receptor repertoire","available RNA-Seq databases","indirect molecular partners","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","ILC1","monocytes","CD4","CD8","ILC2","DCs","ILC3","neutrophils","Conclusions","COPD","hypertension","PPIB","PPIA","atopic dermatitis","cyclophilins","TMPRSS2","BAL","lung","infection","relation","plasmablasts","Asthma","mortality","severity patterns","material","epithelium","Methods","BMI","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, seldom study focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups. Our aim was to compare clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside Hubei province between confirmed and unconfirmed group. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 163 consecutive adult patients with suspected COVID-19 from three tertiary hospitals in two provinces outside Hubei province from January 12, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and the differences in epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results This study enrolled 163 patients with 62 confirmed cases and 101 unconfirmed cases. Most confirmed patients were clustered (31, 50.0%) and with definite epidemiological exposure. Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific, largely fever and dry cough. Laboratory findings in confirmed group were characterized by normal or reduced white blood cell count, reduced the absolute value of lymphocytes, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and accelerated Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The typical chest CT imaging features of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were peripherally distributed multifocal GGO with predominance in the lower lung lobe. Compared with unconfirmed patients, confirmed patients had significantly higher proportion of dry cough, leucopenia, lymphopenia and accelerated ESR (P\u003C0.05); but not with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and myoglobin (P\u003E0.05). Proportion of peripheral, bilateral or lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement, GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram and pleural thickening in the confirmed group were also higher (P\u003C0.05). Conclusions Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific.

Summary Background and objective: Since December 2019, increasing cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being detected worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to provide a scientific reference for the global prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods: General demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were collected that had been reported on the websites of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China. We herein describe distributions in time, place, and population of COVID-19. Results: As of midnight on February 10, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was 42,638, and the province with the largest number of confirmed cases was Hubei (31728), followed by Guangdong (1177), Zhejiang (1117), and Henan (1105) province. The number of cases and the speed of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei were more moderate than those of the Hubei province. The median (interquartile range) age of 1740 patients with COVID-19 was 44 (33, 54) years, with a range of 10 months to 89 years. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic should be considered a global threat and the steps for control include early diagnosis and treatment, as well as isolation.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Lairun; Zhao, Ying; Zhou, Jun; Tao, Mengjun; Yang, Yang; Wang, Xingyu; Ye, Pinkai; Shan, Shajia; Yuan, Hui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/141229dabe9f967845e8fd9ee04c9492700c3b19.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014256520301077; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014256520301077?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong","Henan","provincia de Hubei","Hubei","China","Zhejiang"],"keyphrases":["The COVID","and population of COVID","the number of confirmed cases of COVID","The purpose of","age of","and clinical symptoms of COVID","The number of cases and the speed of confirmed cases in","pacientes de COVID","epidemia de COVID","with a range of","than those of the Hubei province","and the province with the largest number of confirmed cases was Hubei","patients with COVID","provide a scientific reference for the global prevention and control of COVID","and Henan","increasing cases of novel coronavirus","As of midnight on February","of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China","in China was","provincia de Hubei","global threat and the steps for control include early diagnosis and treatment","Summary Background and objective","were collected that had been reported on the","other than Hubei were","distributions in","incremento de casos","mayor n\u00FAmero de casos confirmados","provincia de Henan","as well as isolation","Zhejiang","years","objetivo","mundo","interquartile range","antecedentes epidemiol\u00F3gicos","Resumen Antecedentes","rango intecuart\u00EDlico","followed by Guangdong","epidemiological history","Since December","epidemic should be considered","General demographic characteristics","m\u00FAltiples Comisiones Municipales","paper","caracter\u00EDsticas demogr\u00E1ficas generales","s\u00EDntomas cl\u00EDnicos","sitios web","Salud","nueva enfermedad causada","Results","pasos encaminados","Methods","recomendaciones cient\u00EDficas","velocidad de confirmaci\u00F3n","poblaci\u00F3n","prevenci\u00F3n","months","diagn\u00F3stico temprano","tratamiento","distribuciones temporales","amenaza mundial","provincias","art\u00EDculo","mediana","We herein","Conclusions","being detected worldwide","M\u00E9todos","Conclusiones","Resultados","medianoche","aislamiento"],"language":"es"},

An analysis of death counts from England announced up to 25 April 2020","doi":"10.1101/2020.04.21.20073049","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"Background. Reporting of daily hospital COVID-19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past. Data and methods. We obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement. Findings. The number of hospital COVID-19 deaths announced daily overestimates the maximum number of deaths actually occurring so far in the epidemic in the UK, and also obscures the pattern of decline in deaths. Taking account of reporting delays suggests that for England as a whole a peak in hospital COVID-19 deaths may have been reached on April 8 with a subsequent gradual decline suggested. The same peak is also seen among those aged 60-79 and 80\u002B, although there is slightly shallower decline in the oldest age group (80\u002B years). Among those aged 40-59 years a later peak on April 11 is evident. London shows a peak on April 8 and a clearer and steeper pattern of subsequent decline compared to England as a whole. Interpretation. Analyses of mortality trends must take account of delay, and in communication with the public more emphasis should be placed on looking at trends based on deaths that occurred 5 or more days prior to the announcement day. The slightly weaker decline seen at age 80\u002B may reflect increased hospitalisation of people from care homes, whereas the later peak under the age of 60 years may reflect the higher proportions at these younger ages being admitted to critical care resulting in an extension of life of several days.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leon, David A; Jarvis, Christopher I; Johnson, Anne M; Smeeth, Liam; Shkolnikov, Vladimir M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20073049v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","NHS England"],"locations":["England","London"],"keyphrases":["deaths counts","daily counts","daily data","maximum number of deaths","daily announcement","days","death counts","daily totals","pattern of decline","Reporting of daily hospital COVID","later peak","shallower decline","years","weaker decline","number of hospital COVID","subsequent gradual decline","occurrence of death","date of death","steeper pattern of subsequent decline","account of delay","oldest age group","Analyses of mortality trends","NHS England","UK","epidemic","account of reporting delays","care homes","critical care","tabular form","announcement day","individual period of delay","form of Excel spreadsheets","Simple descriptive analyses","younger ages","fact","increased hospitalisation of people","scientific advisers","key metric","progress","higher proportions","communication","biases inherent","focussing","significant concerns","extension of life","government","public","emphasis","control","certain limitations","region","biased picture","methods","past","London","Background","Findings","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus. We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31). This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, J.; Doherty, M.; Persson, M.

We analysed the liver function indexes of COVID-19 patients to explore the characteristics of liver function changes in patients with different severity. Methods: This study included 54 moderate, 50 severe, and 31 death nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan, China. Epidemiological histories, clinical features, imaging materials, medications and especially major liver function laboratory tests were collected for analysis. Results: The clinical symptoms did not present any significant difference in the patients at admission, but the older male patients had pronounced mortality risk. The normal ratio of ALT, TB, and DBIL of moderate patients was 96.3%, 94.44%, and 98.15% separately at the first test, but 59.26% of patients showed declined ALB levels. The normal ratio of all liver function indexes declined after admission, but most abnormalities were mild (1-2 times of upper limit unit) and went back normal before discharge. In severe patients, the normal ratio of ALB dropped down to 30.61% at admission along with the dramatic impaired normal ratio of bilirubin at the second test. The severe patients liver function dysfunction was worse than the moderate patients but without a significant difference. The dead patients showed a significantly higher level of DBIL, AST, GGT and CRP than other groups patients in the final test, along with the hypoalbuminemia. What is worse, 16.13% of non-survivors were diagnosed with liver failure. No medication was found to be related to ALT, AST, and GGT abnormality in our study. Conclusion: In moderate and severe patients, liver dysfunction was mild. Patients widely presented lower level of ALB. The higher level of bilirubin, AST, and GGT was likely to indicate the worse outcome. Dynamic monitoring of liver function indexes could be considered and liver failure related death should be noticed and prevented in the early stage.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, C.; Jiang, J.; Xu, X.; Hu, Y.; Zhao, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20099614v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALB"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe patients liver function dysfunction","groups patients","dead patients","abnormal liver function","liver dysfunction","DBIL of moderate patients","liver function indexes of COVID","dynamic liver function changes","characteristics of liver function changes","older male patients","liver failure related death","Dynamic monitoring of liver function indexes","major liver function laboratory tests","normal ratio of ALT","normal ratio of ALB","admission","AST","dramatic impaired normal ratio of bilirubin","higher level of bilirubin","higher level of DBIL","lower level of","GGT abnormality","significant difference","worse outcome","final test","study","death nucleic acid","declined ALB levels","clinical features","clinical symptoms","medications","imaging materials","TB","CRP","Epidemiological histories","different severity","mortality risk","non-survivors","times of upper limit unit","central hospital of Wuhan","studies","China","analysis","Conclusion","Results","hypoalbuminemia","abnormalities","Methods","Background","early stage","discharge"],"language":"en"},

IFITM3 reduces membrane fusion between cells and virions through a poorly characterized mechanism. We identified a GxxxG motif in many CD225 proteins, including IFITM3 and proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2). Mutation of PRRT2, a regulator of neurotransmitter release, at glycine-305 was previously linked to paroxysmal neurological disorders in humans. Here, we show that glycine-305 and the homologous site in IFITM3, glycine-95, drive protein oligomerization from within a GxxxG motif. Mutation of glycine-95 in IFITM3 disrupted its oligomerization and reduced its antiviral activity against Influenza A and HIV-1. The oligomerization-defective variant was used to reveal that IFITM3 promotes membrane rigidity in a glycine-95-dependent manner. Furthermore, a compound which counteracts virus inhibition by IFITM3, amphotericin B, prevented the IFITM3-mediated rigidification of membranes. Overall, these data suggest that IFITM3 oligomers inhibit virus-cell fusion by promoting membrane rigidity.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahman, Kazi; Coomer, Charles A.; Majdoul, Saliha; Ding, Selena; Padilla-Parra, Sergi; Compton, Alex A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/012d7a7b12e5293e1cc4ac26d0557067f14d8e52.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.096891","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM3 oligomers","Mutation of glycine","IFITM3-mediated rigidification of membranes","membrane fusion","membrane rigidity","CD225 proteins","virus-cell fusion","virus inhibition","drive protein oligomerization","GxxxG motif","Mutation of PRRT2","diverse virus infections","oligomerization-defective variant","CD225 family","proline rich transmembrane protein","interferon-inducible transmembrane","amphotericin B","Dispanin","virions","cells","regulator of neurotransmitter release","antiviral activity","homologous site","paroxysmal neurological disorders","humans","Influenza","HIV","compound","data","characterized mechanism","dependent manner"],"language":"en"},

The addition of rapid smartphone-based exposure notification offers few benefits over conventional manual tracing alone unless uptake of the digital system is near-universal.

Design: Observational, retrospective cohort study. Setting: Nine-hospital health system within the Northeastern United States. Populations: Adult patients ([\u2265] 18 years) admitted from the emergency department who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) up to 24 hours after initial presentation. Patients meeting criteria for critical respiratory illness within 4 hours of arrival were excluded. Main outcome and performance measures: We used a composite endpoint of respiratory critical illness as defined by oxygen requirement beyond low-flow nasal cannula (e.g., non-rebreather mask, high-flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive pressure ventilation), intubation, or death within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. We developed predictive models using patient demographic and clinical data collected during those first 4 hours. Eight hospitals were used for development and internal validation (n=932) and 1 hospital for model external validation (n=240). Predictive variables were identified using an ensemble approach that included univariate regression, random forest, logistic regression with LASSO, Chi-square testing, gradient boosting information gain, and gradient boosting Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values prior to manual curation. We generated two predictive models, a quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) that uses only exam and vital sign measurements, and a COVID-19 severity index (CSI) machine learning model. Using area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC), precision-recall curves (AU-PRC) and calibration metrics, we compare the qCSI and CSI to three illness scoring systems: Elixhauser mortality score, qSOFA, and CURB-65. We present performance of qCSI and CSI on an external validation cohort. Results: During the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Six-hundred and twenty patients were excluded based on age or critical illness within the first 4 hours, yielding 1172 patients in the final cohort. Of these patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours. The qCSI (AU-ROC: 0.90 [0.85-0.96]) comprised of nasal cannula flow rate, respiratory rate, and minimum documented pulse oximetry outperformed the baseline models (qSOFA: 0.76 [0.69-0.85]; Elixhauser: 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; CURB-65: AU-ROC 0.66 [0.58-0.77]) and was validated on an external cohort (AU-ROC: 0.82). The machine learning-based CSI had superior performance on the training cohort (AU-ROC: 0.91 [0.86-0.97]), but was unlikely to provide practical improvements in clinical settings. Conclusions: A significant proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients decompensate within 24 hours of hospital presentation and these events are accurately predicted using respiratory exam findings within a simple scoring system.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haimovich, A.; Ravindra, N.

However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaohua; Zhao, Binghong; Qu, Yueming; Chen, Yurou; Xiong, Jie; Feng, Yong; Men, Dong; Huang, Qianchuan; Liu, Ying; Yang, Bo; Ding, Jinya; Li, Feng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7852aafdfb9e59e6af78a47af796325434f8922a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLA","New Coronavirus Pneumonia","Generalized Linear Models"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ill patients group","serum IL","specific class of patients","incidence of RNAaemia","serum SARS-CoV","inflammatory cytokine IL","serum viral load detection","high IL","vital signs of COVID","poor prognosis of COVID","occurrence of cytokine storm","viral load detection of respiratory specimen","diagnosis","levels","designated hospital","routine statistical analysis","novel coronavirus disease","excessive inflammatory response","Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia","National Health Commission of China","General Hospital of Central Theater Command","PLA","Linear Models","version","patient status prediction model","nucleic acid","RT-PCR Ct value","GLMs","Wuhan","therapeutic target","cases","groups","study","Interpretation","laboratory data","Findings","folds higher","Methods","Background","results","fraction","illness severity"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients\u0027 fertility.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, C.; Li, K.; Ding, Y.; Lu, W.

Clinicians worldwide appear to be at a loss to know how to prevent and treat the severe respiratory distress in these patients effectively. Consequently, the fundamental mechanisms leading to death in high-risk patients with COVID-19 need to be discovered and addressed with urgency. Despite a marked drop in frequency, the post-mortem autopsy remains an essential part of both discovering the cause of death in a particular individual, but also in advancing the science and treatment of disease, especially in the case of novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2[2]. The goal of an autopsy is to discover the cause of death (COD) using a macro/microscopic investigation. Traditionally, the intact organs are carefully removed, inspected, and weighed. Because lung weight is often affected by the cause of death and the last breath occurs very near if not at the moments of death, the evaluation of the lungs is one of the starting points of any COD investigation[3]. Method A comprehensive search was performed to systematically review all reported autopsy findings in COVID-19 patients in order to better understand the underlying disease mechanisms resulting in death. We then compared these findings with the results of a targeted literature review of hyaluronan in relationship to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results In total, data from 181 autopsies were identified. From this group, 6 autopsies of COVID-19 patients were selected for a detailed review and statistical analysis. The average lung weight of those who were determined to have died as a result of SARS-CoV-2 was 2196g-approximately 2.5x normal lung weight. Hyaline membranes were consistently identified on histologic sections. A review of the literature reveals that hyaluronan has been associated with the pathophysiology of ARDS since 1967. However, its key role in driving the morbidity and mortality of the condition has heretofore not been fully recognized. Conclusions We propose that the induced hyaluronan storm syndrome or IHS, is the model that best addresses the heretofore perplexing respiratory failure that is the proximal cause of death in a minority, but ever rising number, of patients. In addition to treating and preventing IHS in currently infected individuals now; an aggressive research effort should be undertaken to discover why the majority of individuals who are exposed to the virus are either minimally or asymptomatic, while a minority of high-risk individuals rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death.

Although lungs seem to be the main target of the infection very few information are available about liver involvement in COVID-19 infection, that could possibly evocate a systemic disease targeting a lot of organs. Since now there are no reports of large series of histological evaluation of liver morphology in this setting. Knowledge of histological liver findings connected to clinical data is crucial in management of this disease. Post-mortem wedge liver biopsies from 48 patients died for COVID-19 infection were available from two main hospitals located in northern Italy, Lombardy; all sample were obtained during autopsies. No patient has a significant clinical complain of liver disease or signs of liver failure before and during hospitalization; for each of them laboratory data focused on liver were available. All liver samples showed minimal inflammation features; on the other side, many histological pictures compatible with vascular alterations were observed, characterized by portal vein braches number increase associated with lumen massive dilatation, partial or complete recent luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, fibrosis of portal tract, focally severely enlarged and fibrotic. Our preliminary results concerning histological liver involvement in COVID-19 infection confirm the clinical impression that liver failure is not a main concern and this organ is not the target of significant inflammatory damage; histopatological findings are highly suggestive for marked alteration of intrahepatic blood vessel network secondary to systemic alterations induced by virus that could target, besides lung parenchyma, cardiovascular system, coagulation cascade or endothelial layer of blood vessels.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"sonzogni, a.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20092718v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liver disease","liver samples","histological liver involvement","signs of liver failure","Knowledge of histological liver findings","infection","COVID","Post-mortem wedge liver biopsies","main target","reports of large series of histological evaluation of liver morphology","clinical data","systemic disease","systemic alterations","clinical impression","histological pictures compatible","main hospitals","main concern","portal vein braches number increase","target of significant inflammatory damage","fibrosis of portal tract","histopatological findings","endothelial layer of blood vessels","sinusoidal vessels","ill patients","huge number","serious increase","vascular alterations","northern Italy","laboratory data","complete recent luminal thrombosis of portal","marked alteration of intrahepatic blood vessel network secondary","coagulation cascade","lumen massive dilatation","cardiovascular system","lung parenchyma","information","preliminary results","Lombardy","virus","minimal inflammation features","management","mortality","lot of organs","setting","breakout","hospitalization","lungs","autopsies"],"language":"en"},

This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or atomizer and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass. We strongly suggest validation of masks and respirators with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) approved fit testing prior to use in a clinical environment.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Provenzano, D.; Rao, Y.

We use a stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised using current case data, although we do not make use of information concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that at the early stages of New Zealand\u0027s response) can lead to containment or elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place. Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing, or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plank, Michael J; Binny, Rachelle N; Hendy, Shaun C; Lustig, Audrey; James, Alex; Steyn, Nicholas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6393293fd5ae1a09bf22370f7f20ac499268c33a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058743","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["relaxing strong population-wide controls","case isolation operations","fast case isolation","Slow case isolation","population-wide control methods","population-wide control measures","case numbers","age-structured population","current case data","week period of strong Level","fast tracing","elimination scenarios","stochastic model","possibility of regional containment","efficient tracing","testing","COVID","outbreak","place","weeks","effects of geographic dispersion","geographic dispersion of cases","early stages of New Zealand\u0027s response","use of information","inter-regional travel restrictions","contact network structure","potential","risk communities","harm","outcome","effectiveness","opportunity","essential workers","rates comparable","exit","speed of growth","country","co-morbidities","versions"],"language":"en"},

At cellular level, virus infection initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-\u03B1/\u03B2-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russo, Roberta; Andolfo, Immacolata; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Iolascon, Achille; Capasso, Mario","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11a27e81a2b607cad6243f6231e7454642b97699.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.057190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TMPRSS2 protein expression","high expression of TMPRSS2","viral infection","TMPRSS2 activity","different susceptibility","gene expression","SARS-CoV","genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2","infection coronavirus disease","cellular level","different populations","low expression","virus infection initiates","cellular antiviral response","lung-specific eQTL variants","viral spread","differential susceptibility","host surface cellular receptor angiotensin","cellular serine protease","coronavirus infections","ACE2","binding of viral particles","coding-region variants","eQTL variant rs35074065","entry receptor","infected host","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","\u03B2-inducible gene","S protein priming","influenza","enzyme","MX1","important insights","IFN","pathogenesis","decrease","splicing isoform","interferon","similar conditions","COVID","findings","subjects"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods: We searched on Medline and Cochrane databases. The search generated 328 manuscripts. We included nine original proteomic studies that investigated human cataractous lenses. Results: Deamidation was the major age-related post-translational modification. There was a significant increase in the amount of A-crystallin D-isoAsp58 present at all ages, while an increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged normal lenses. During aging, enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included GAPDH, glutathione synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and PARK7. Conclusion: D-isoAsp in A crystallin could be associated with the development of age-related cataract in human, by contributing to the denaturation of a crystallin, and decreasing its ability to act as a chaperone. Oxidation of Trp may be associated with nuclear cataract formation in man, while the role of oxidant stress in age-related cataract formation is dominant.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karakosta, C.; Tzamalis, A.; Aivaliotis, M.; Tsinopoulos, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a067c1e6315ce7ff2832dbc84ec8652e7a962c5f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/19009035v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Trp"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["age-related cataract formation","cataract lenses","development of age-related cataract","nuclear cataract formation","human cataractous lenses","critical role","human lens proteomics","Oxidation of Trp","aging lens","crystallin D-isoAsp58 present","aged normal lenses","extent of Trp oxidation","major age-related post-translational modification","critical sites","sorbitol dehydrogenase","aldehyde dehydrogenase","significant increase","role of oxidant stress","GAPDH","glutathione synthase","oxidized cysteine","Deamidation","enzymes","order","original proteomic studies","available data","ages","physiopathology","Medline","aim","systematic review","Results","PARK7","methods","Cochrane databases","Purpose","Conclusion","ability","denaturation","search","manuscripts","Materials"],"language":"en"},

Methods A total of 56 COVID-19 patients without symptoms at admission and 19 age-matched symptomatic patients were enrolled. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was tested using transcriptase quantitative PCR, and the total antibodies (Ab), IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 were tested using Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immuno Assay. Results Among 56 patients without symptoms at admission, 33 cases displayed symptoms and 23 remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. 43.8% of the asymptomatic carriers were children and none of the asymptomatic cases had recognizable changes in C-reactive protein or interleukin-6, except one 64-year-old patient. The initial threshold cycle value of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers was similar to that in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients, but the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers (9.63 days) was shorter than pre-symptomatic patients (13.6 days). There was no obvious differences of the seropositive conversion rate of total Ab, IgG, and IgA among the three groups, though the rates of IgM varied largely. The average peak IgG and IgM COI of asymptomatic cases was 3.5 and 0.8, respectively, which is also lower than those in symptomatic patients with peaked IgG and IgM COI of 4.5 and 2.4 (p \u003C0.05).

Design: Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1st April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (a) asymptomatic (b) symptomatic cases from (i) virological studies (repeated testing), (ii) tracing studies (iii) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Information sources: Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv, BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was utilised, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, HRB open databases. Results: There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median pre-symptomatic infectious period across studies varied over \u003C1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95%CI: 10.9-15.8), but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95%CI: 15.1-21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time-to-death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. Conclusions: There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads, and viral replication data alone, and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times. Despite this, available data provides a preliminary evidence base to inform models of central tendency for key parameters, and variation for exploring parameter space and sensitivity analysis. Some current models may be underestimating infectious period.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byrne, A.

Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths immediately indicate that countries like Italy and Spain have the worst situation as of mid April 2020, on its own, reported cases do not provide a correct picture of the situation. The reason is that different countries diagnose diversely and present very distinctive reported case fatality rate (CFR). The same levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying picture. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain an uniform unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empiric. The key assumption of the method is that the real CFR in Europe of COVID-19 is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol has a dynamic nature, and it has been giving converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as of mid April 2020. From this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain an Effective Potential Growth (EPG) updated everyday providing an unbiased assessment of the countries with more potential to have an uncontrolled situation. The method developed will be used to track possible improvements on the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Catala, M.; Pino, D.; Marchena, M.; Palacios, P.; Urdiales, T.; Cardona, P.-J.; Alonso, S.; Lopez-Codina, D.; Prats, C.; Alvarez Lacalle, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4eaa49f76b8fa00d976864ac8afa2a62379b8ad0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20087023v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain","Europe"],"keyphrases":["European countries","different countries","respective countries","diagnostic rates","method","reported positive cases","levels of reported incidence","distinctive reported case fatality rate","European country","worst situation","epidemic of COVID","uncontrolled situation","way total deaths","real CFR","unbiased assessment","robust estimation","estimation protocol","uniform unbiased incidence","different underlying picture","real spread","fast assessment","Europe of COVID","correct picture","country-dependent","Effective Potential Growth","policy makers","mortality","Italy","governments","EPG","Spain","converging numbers","possible improvements","Policymakers","dynamic nature","demography","empiric","key assumption","Standard measures","reason"],"language":"en"},

Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include studies that assess patients with confirmed or suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2 and inform the relation of potential prognostic factors with death or disease severity. Two groups of two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates.

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens.

Limitation of the pandemic is mainly facilitated by reducing infections. An effective strategy is social distancing. However, this strategy draws more and more criticism, in Germany as elsewhere, because of its economic and psychological consequences for society. How can the number of infected person be held below the medical care capacity while restrictions affecting the general public are minimized? Various approaches exist to retarding the infection rate during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak until vaccine has been developed, without overloading medical capacity. Options being discussed include large-scale testing, contact tracing and social distancing. A study published by the Imperial College contains a model calculation of the effects of alternating school closings and openings in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, no satisfactory solution was developed. Variables which describe the medical care resources in Germany and the age and occupational structure of its population contrast sharply with American and British conditions. This study attempts to apply the Imperial College approach of alternating quarantine and normal episodes for the entire population. Mathematically, an oscillation in hospitalization can be imposed.

To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results. Methods: We reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials. Results: There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days. A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up. Conclusion: Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Wolkewitz, Martin; Hazard, Derek; Lambert, Jerome","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f10fb0ee869f01e39652ca0079888562e865b0ea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Library of Medicine","National Institutes of Health","NIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heterogeneous endpoints","differing endpoints","primary endpoints","various endpoints","multiplicity of endpoints","recommended endpoints","Effectiveness Trials","Multistate model analysis","registered interventional trials","proposed model","ongoing clinical trials","involved decision-makers","primary analysis","differing lengths of follow-up","detailed investigation of treatment effects","data","potential effects of treatments","faster decision making","ritonavir","Lopinavir","Hydroxychloroquine","interventional COVID","discharge","results","major events mechanical ventilation","major clinical events informative","potential benefits of Remdesivir","National Institutes of Health","Core Outcome Measures","core outcome set","detailed high quality evidence","course of time","information available","defined endpoint","sufficient information","public health authorities","category endpoint accounts","National Library of Medicine","drug regulatory agencies","clinicians","stacked probability plot","powerful tool","fast availability","NLM","duration of hospitalization","COMET","hospital capacities","severe cases","challenge","evaluation","Initiative","step","NIH","death","Conclusion","mortality","global network","community","Methods","Background","pneumonia","days"],"language":"en"},

Since COVID-19 outbreak, various agents have been tested but no proven effective therapies have been identified. This has led to a lot of controversies among associated researches. Hence, in order to address the issue of using hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods. A thorough search was carried out to find relevant studies in MEDLINE, medRxiv, PubMed, Cochrane Database, China Academic Journals Full-text Database and Web of Science. Two investigators independently reviewed 274 abstracts and 23 articles. The trials which evaluated hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 were included for this systematic review. Two investigators assessed quality of the studies and data extraction was done by one reviewer and cross checked by the other. Results. Five trials involving 677 patients were included while conducting the meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin showed benefits in positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.95 [95% CI,0.19 to 19.73] and a reduction in progression rate (OR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.37]), but without demonstrating any statistical significance. This systematic review has also suggested a possible synergistic effect of the combination therapy which included hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. However, the use of hydroxychloroquine alone was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. The use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19 patients, seems to be effective. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has shown synergic effects. However, mortality rate was increased when the treatment was conducted with hydroxychloroquine.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, T.-H.; Chou, C.-Y.; Yang, Y.-F.; Yang, Y.-P.; Chien, C.-S.; Yarmishyn, A.

Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neher, Richard A; Dyrdak, Robert; Druelle, Valentin; Hodcroft, Emma B; Albert, Jan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1218f278a4f8d83dac14b23c8f698062812ef9d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["transmission rate variation","consistent seasonal variation","combination of seasonal variation","substantial variation","SARS-CoV","likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation","Seasonal forcing","global transmission","plausible parameters","variable parameters","model","Data","transmission clusters of various sizes","infection control measures","infection control efforts","prolonged pandemic wave","Simulations of different scenarios","lower prevalence","incidence rate","larger peak","small peak","temperate regions","subpopulations of different size","Northern Hemisphere","endemic coronaviruses","better preparation of health care systems","HKU1","window of opportunity","migration rates","given time","routine diagnostics","OC43","cases","transient reductions","transmissibility","NL63","winter","monitoring","novel coronavirus","confirmed infections","fatalities","uncertainty","Wuhan","China","account","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response. Methodology: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies by luciferase immunoprecipitation assay systems (LIPS) to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. A subset of samples was tested with and without heat inactivation. Results: Fifteen or more days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from six patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike antibodies appearing between day 8 to day 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to immunocompetent patients. Conclusions: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection.

Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. This effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berg, Martha K; Yu, Qinggang; Salvador, Cristina E; Melani, Irene; Kitayama, Shinobu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fea0be0d28dfecf7152b551c25c7a5e7695fe46.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG","Linear"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mandated BCG vaccination","presence of mandated BCG policies","deaths","confirmed cases","countries","COVID","population density","population size","net migration rate","gross domestic product","growth curves","various cultural dimensions","exponential increase","individualism","median age","significant flattening","day period of country","risk of different infectious diseases","tightness","wise outbreaks","day-by-day reports","looseness of social norms","Linear mixed models","fight","Prior work","analysis","protective factor","effect"],"language":"en"},

Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (\u002B)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (\u002B)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (\u002B)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (\u2212)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (\u002B)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19 and other (\u002B)ssRNA related diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haimovich, Gal; Olender, Tsviya; Baez, Camila; Gerst, Jeffrey E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df66f1415f0f804eff736d77e5a8712497f25741.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Group IV","VRC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ssRNA viruses","V RNA viruses","ssRNA related diseases","secreted proteins","cis-acting RNA motifs","SARS-CoV","secretion of secreted viral proteins","aspects of RNA biology","single-strand RNA","unique cis RNA element","binding proteins","ER membranes","efficient translation","enhanced translation","presence","genomes of SARS","pyrimidine nucleotide","mRNA localization","viral replication centers","secretion of translated protein","different organellar membranes","independent of genome length","consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats","posttranscriptional processing","nuclear export","double membrane vesicles","Flaviviruses","occurrence","major role","identification","new drug targets","bacteria","Hepaciviruses","endoplasmic reticulum","function","VRCs","yeast","Rabies","Mumps","Enteroviruses","Group","multiple copies","sequences","Future studies","COVID","membranal","mRNAs","degradation","Coronaviruses","Coronaviridae","earlier work","Influenza","humans","abundance","VRC formation","nucleus","cytoplasm","kilobase"],"language":"en"},

We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran\u0027s situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ke; Darcet, Didier; Wang, Qian; Sornette, Didier","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ff5bc239964a0d2cb69e68461dbaae3b322580b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China","Europe","Japan","Tokyo","Iran","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["China","outbreak","CI","generalized growth model","generalized logistic growth model","Japan","South Korea","provinces","generalized Richards model","reported number of infected cases","scenario predictions","probable scenario","positive scenario","future scenario projections","absence of serious measures","serious situations","significant risk","Italy","world","days","negative future scenarios","drastic control measures","extreme containment measures","high risk","estimated total confirmed cases","heterogenous situations","significant health","calibration results","short-term end","different models","phenomenological models","affected countries","Chinese experience","European population","Italian population","lower bounds","economic risks","detailed analysis","impact","aggregate level","development","early stages","Summer Olympics","instructive variations","Tokyo","Iran\u0027s situation","Conclusions","USA","continuation","epidemics","ceiling","phases","coming months","Methods","people","Background","COVID"],"language":"en"},

The goal of this ecological cross-sectional study is to examine the demographic and economic nature of spatial hot and cold spots of SARS-CoV-2 rates in New York City and Chicago as of April 13, 2020. In both cities, cold spots (clusters of low SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) demonstrated typical protective factors associated with the social determinants of health and the ability to social distance. These neighborhoods tended to be wealthier, have higher educational attainment, higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents, and more workers in managerial occupations. Hot spots (clusters of high SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) also had similarities, such as lower rates of college graduates and higher proportions of people of color. It also appears to be larger households (more people per household), rather than overall population density, that may to be a more strongly associated with hot spots. Findings suggest important differences between the cities\u0027 hot spots as well. They can be generalized by describing the NYC hot spots as working-class and middle-income communities, perhaps indicative of service workers and other occupations (including those classified as \u0022essential services\u0022 during the pandemic) that may not require a college degree but pay wages above poverty levels. Chicago\u0027s hot spot neighborhoods, on the other hand, are among the city\u0027s most vulnerable, low-income neighborhoods with extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, and non-Hispanic Black residents.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maroko, A.

Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access. This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy. Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center. The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glehen, O.; Kepenekian, V.; Bouch\u00E9, O.; Gladieff, L.; Honore, C.; Big-Renape, Renape -","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e4eb987b1e8857d5e8e414f419d0335c625ffdd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20300991; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20300991?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RENAPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the phase","The BIG","is the gold","The prioritization","curative care","charge curative","prise","Abstract The Covid","for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be","peritoneal metastases","pandemic is profoundly changing the organization","the usual selection criteria is needed","unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after","the epidemic to allow optimal peri","limited peritoneal extension","resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas","vis\u00E9e curative","operative care","RENAPE groups","charge p\u00E9ri","peritoneal neoplastic diseases","It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions","cycles de chimioth\u00E9rapie syst\u00E9mique","without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy","which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel","which cytoreduction surgery with","courses","This is particularly so","conditions locales","temporary or long","or no comorbidities","prioritizing care provision","intensive care resources","priorisation des indications","CHIP","HIPEC must be discussed case","indications must consider local conditions","m\u00E9soth\u00E9liomes p\u00E9riton\u00E9aux malins r\u00E9s\u00E9cables","young patients with","pathologies n\u00E9oplasiques p\u00E9riton\u00E9ales","case in an expert center","in interval surgery after at most","first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable","pseudomyxomes p\u00E9riton\u00E9aux","standard treatment","term alternative","m\u00E9tastases p\u00E9riton\u00E9ales","alternative temporaire","patients jeunes","bloc op\u00E9ratoire","centre expert","groupes BIG","phase de la p\u00E9riode \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","extension p\u00E9riton\u00E9ale limit\u00E9e","colorectal origin if they","pseudomyxoma peritonei","origine colorectale","tentative proposals","moyens importants","\u00E8re intention","healthcare access","s\u00E9lection","particulier","maximum","Addition","consid\u00E9ration","tightening","carcinoses ovariennes","co-morbidit\u00E9s","situation intervallaire","cytor\u00E9duction associ\u00E9e","chimiohyperthermie intrap\u00E9riton\u00E9ale","soins","cures","traitement de r\u00E9f\u00E9rence","celles","pistes de r\u00E9flexion","renforcement des crit\u00E8res habituels","acc\u00E8s","organisation","chirurgie","r\u00E9animation","adjonction","pand\u00E9mie"],"language":"fr"},

Although the infection in natural hosts and zoonotic transmission to humans is asymptomatic, FVs can replicate well in human cells making it an attractive gene therapy vector candidate. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy and (cryo-)electron tomography ultrastructural data on purified prototype FV (PFV) and PFV infected cells. Mature PFV particles have a distinct morphology with a capsid of constant dimension as well as a less ordered shell of density between the capsid and the membrane likely formed by the Gag N-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic part of the Env leader peptide gp18(LP). The viral membrane contains trimeric Env glycoproteins partly arranged in interlocked hexagonal assemblies. In situ 3D reconstruction by subtomogram averaging of wild type Env and of a Env gp48(TM)- gp80(SU) cleavage site mutant showed a similar spike architecture as well as stabilization of the hexagonal lattice by clear connections between lower densities of neighboring trimers. Cryo-EM was employed to obtain a 9 \u00C5 resolution map of the glycoprotein in its pre-fusion state, which revealed extensive trimer interactions by the receptor binding subunit gp80(SU) at the top of the spike and three central helices derived from the fusion protein subunit gp48(TM). The lower part of Env, presumably composed of interlaced parts of gp48(TM), gp80(SU) and gp18(LP) anchors the spike at the membrane. We propose that the gp48(TM) density continues into three central transmembrane helices, which interact with three outer transmembrane helices derived from gp18(LP). Our ultrastructural data and 9 \u00C5 resolution glycoprotein structure provide important new insights into the molecular architecture of PFV and its distinct evolutionary relationship with other members of the Retroviridae.","publish_time":"2016-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Effantin, Gr\u00E9gory; Estrozi, Leandro F.; Aschman, Nick; Renesto, Patricia; Stanke, Nicole; Lindemann, Dirk; Schoehn, Guy; Weissenhorn, Winfried","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/714e40f88f6e629f0f63574ec52ea967aeee4065.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4939959.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4939959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Env gp48","TM","LP","Env leader peptide gp18","central helices","molecular architecture of PFV","trimeric Env glycoproteins","wild type Env","PFV infected cells","central transmembrane helices","fusion protein subunit gp48","distinct morphology","distinct lineage","Mature PFV particles","similar spike architecture","outer transmembrane helices","interlaced parts of gp48","viral membrane","Cryo-EM","\u00C5 resolution glycoprotein structure","electron tomography ultrastructural data","receptor binding subunit gp80","present cryo-electron microscopy","distinct evolutionary relationship","\u00C5 resolution map","hexagonal lattice","human cells","Retroviridae family","purified prototype FV","pre-fusion state","interlocked hexagonal assemblies","capsid of constant dimension","ordered shell of density","lower densities of neighboring trimers","important new insights","extensive trimer interactions","clear connections","zoonotic transmission","cleavage site mutant","humans","subtomogram","stabilization","natural hosts","attractive gene therapy vector candidate","FVs","D reconstruction","Gag N-terminal domain","infection","members","genus Spumavirus","situ","Foamy viruses"],"language":"en"},

In Thailand, there has been a little information on the molecular characteristics of the SIVs since the first isolation of viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in the late 1970s. Our previous study demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine H1 and avian\u2010like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350\u2013353). Objectives In the present study, we genetically characterized 12 SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated between 2000 and 2005. Methods We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of those isolates. Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian\u2010like swine and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages within classical swine H1 and NS, avian\u2010like swine PA and M and human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian\u2010like swine and human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig population. The predominance of avian\u2010like swine genes amongst the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian\u2010like swine origin were retained in all the Thai SIVs examined. Conclusions These observations may suggest that genes of avian\u2010like swine lineages have some advantages to be maintained in pigs as seen in the SIVs established through multiple introductions in other regions.","publish_time":"2008-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takemae, Nobuhiro; Parchariyanon, Sujira; Damrongwatanapokin, Sudarat; Uchida, Yuko; Ruttanapumma, Ruttapong; Watanabe, Chiaki; Yamaguchi, Shigeo; Saito, Takehiko","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e59218b42f783a547778cbf247cce2552f9a163a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4941901.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["swine genes","Thai SIVs","swine PA","swine lineages","swine origin","classical swine H1","swine N1 genes","swine influenza viruses","Thai H1N1 SIVs","multiple introductions of classical swine","matrix genes of avian","predominance of avian","human viruses","N2 genes","Thai pig population","introduction of viruses","isolation of viruses","distinct genotypes","human H3","H3N2 subtypes","human origins","existence of genetic diversity","distinct sublineages","previous study","present study","Control of Influenza VI","Options","Proceedings","PB2","Takemae","entire nucleotide sequences","gene segments","polymerase","PB1","molecular characteristics","H1N2","little information","Background Recent studies","Methods","advantages","observations","Phylogenetic analysis","isolates","Objectives","regions","Conclusions","pigs","world","Thailand"],"language":"en"},

To circumvent these difficulties, three peptides were derived from complementarity determining regions of an antibody heavy chain against influenza A spike glycoprotein. Their binding properties were studied experimentally, and by molecular dynamics simulations. Two peptide candidates showed binding to influenza A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2. One of them, termed PeB, with the highest affinity prevented binding to and infection of target cells in the micromolar region without any cytotoxic effect. PeB matches best the conserved receptor binding site of hemagglutinin. PeB bound also to other medical relevant influenza strains, such as human-pathogenic A/California/7/2009 H1N1, and avian-pathogenic A/Mute Swan/Rostock/R901/2006 H7N1. Strategies to improve the affinity and to adapt specificity are discussed and exemplified by a double amino acid substituted peptide, obtained by substitutional analysis.

Recently, there have been several reports related to codon usage in fungi, but little is known about codon usage bias in Epichlo\u00EB endophytes. The present study aimed to assess codon usage patterns and biases in 4870 sequences from Epichlo\u00EB festucae, which may be helpful in revealing the constraint factors such as mutation or selection pressure and improving the bioreactor on the cloning, expression, and characterization of some special genes. The GC content with 56.41% is higher than the AT content (43.59%) in E. festucae. The results of neutrality and effective number of codons plot analyses showed that both mutational bias and natural selection play roles in shaping codon usage in this species. We found that gene length is strongly correlated with codon usage and may contribute to the codon usage patterns observed in genes. Nucleotide composition and gene expression levels also shape codon usage bias in E. festucae. E. festucae exhibits codon usage bias based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of 61 sense codons, with 25 codons showing an RSCU larger than 1.

The aim of this study was to assess the changes in lung function and lung thin-section computed tomography (CT) features in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially the dynamic changes in ground-glass opacity (GGO). MATERIAL/METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from 11 patients with SARS were collected. The serial follow-up thin-section CTs were evaluated at 3, 6, and 84 months after SARS presentation. The distribution and predominant thin-section CT findings of lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: The extent of the lesions on the CT scans of the 11 patients decreased at 6 and 84 months compared to 3 months. The number of segments involved on 84-month follow-up CTs was less than those at 6 months (P\u003C0.05). The predominant thin-section CT manifestation at 84 months (intralobular and interlobular septal thickening) was different than that at 6 months, at which GGO was predominant. CONCLUSIONS: During convalescence after SARS, GGO and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the main thin-section CT manifestation. Intralobular and interlobular septal thickening predominated over GGO at 84 months.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xiaohua; Dong, Dawei; Ma, Daqing","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b4118a71d2dc9dae927ebd17ba9dcaa22f57ce2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4982531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4982531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months","section CT manifestation","GGO","section CT findings of lesions","CT scans","section CTs","SARS presentation","long-term CT findings","interlobular septal thickening","Intralobular","patients","long-term impaired lung","lung function","survivors","month follow-up CTs","radiological data","dynamic changes","paucity of data","acute disease","serial follow-up","severe acute respiratory syndrome","features","ground-glass opacity","tomography","METHODS","capacity","convalescence","MATERIAL","extent","distribution","number of segments","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","aim","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20(L)) and there may be higher-order interactions among more than two sites. Here we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in protein GB1, containing 20(4) = 160,000 variants. We found that while reciprocal sign epistasis blocked many direct paths of adaptation, such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by indirect paths through genotype space involving gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These indirect paths alleviate the constraint on adaptive protein evolution, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may change our views on how proteins evolve.

However, it is also well established that LC3 can localize on various membranous structures other than autophagosomes. We recently demonstrated that the LC3 conjugation system (ATG7, ATG3, and ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1) is required to target LC3 and IFNG (interferon, gamma)-inducible GTPases to the parasitophorus vacuole membrane (PVM) of a protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii and consequently for IFNG to control T. gondii infection. Here we show that not only LC3, but also its homologs (GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2) localize on the PVM of T. gondii in a conjugation-dependent manner. Knockout/knockdown of all LC3 homologs led to a significant reduction in targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii and the IFNG-mediated control of T. gondii infection. Furthermore, when we relocated the ATG12\u2013ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, which specifies the conjugation site of LC3 homologs, to alternative target membranes, the IFNG-inducible GTPases were targeted to the new target membranes rather than the PVM of T. gondii. These data suggest that the localization of LC3 homologs onto a membrane by the LC3 conjugation system is necessary and sufficient for targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the membrane, implying Targeting by AutophaGy proteins (TAG). Our data further suggest that the conjugation of ubiquitin-like LC3 homologs to the phospholipids of membranes may change the destiny of the membranes beyond degradation through lysosomal fusion, as the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins changes the destiny of the proteins beyond proteasomal degradation.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sungwoo; Choi, Jayoung; Biering, Scott B.; Dominici, Erin; Williams, Lelia E.; Hwang, Seungmin","journal":"Autophagy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d7ec0ea6c212f7ebeb08fb52d0f9e691d6d523b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4990996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFNG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LC3 conjugation system","conjugation site of LC3 homologs","localization of LC3 homologs","IFNG-inducible GTPases","PVM","conjugation of ubiquitin","gondii infection","IFNG-mediated control","alternative target membranes","new target membranes","conjugation-dependent manner","phospholipids of membranes","protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii","AutophaGy proteins","implying Targeting","destiny","ATG12","autophagosomes","data","parasitophorus vacuole membrane","ATG5-ATG16L1 complex","proteasomal degradation","ATG3","ATG7","significant reduction","interferon","gamma","lysosomal fusion","TAG","various membranous structures","GABARAPL2","GABARAPL1","Knockout","knockdown","marker"],"language":"en"},

Salivirus/klassevirus was first identified as an etiologic agent of gastroenteritis and was never reported in respiratory infection cases. The case being discussed here caught our attention because, although it is a common respiratory infection, it was fatal, while similar cases were mild. In order to find potential causes in the fatal case, we describe the clinical diagnosis and treatment, the sequencing analysis of the salivirus/klassevirus, and the co-infectious adenovirus. Metagenomics sequencing was conducted on the samples from a nasopharyngeal swab of the children with adenovirus infection. Sequences were assembled using IDBA-ud (1.1.1); phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA 5.2. RT-PCR and quantitative PCR were performed to verify the existence of the virus in the samples. A nearly full genome of this new virus strain was obtained with 7633 nt encoding a polyprotein of 2331 aa. Meanwhile, it was detected specifically in the nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR. Further, homology analysis indicated that the virus has a closer relationship with Salivirus A strain in Shanghai (GU245894). Our study reports the first case of Human salivirus/klassevirus in respiratory specimens of a child with fatal adenovirus infection in Shenzhen, China. The finding and investigation of the virus will provide more useful information for the clinical diagnosis of unexplained lethal infection and expand our knowledge of the new family, salivirus/klassevirus in picornavirus.

Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV, genogroup GI and GII) and sapovirus (SaV), is a leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea in individuals across all age groups. However, few studies had been conducted clarifying the characteristics of HuCV in diarrhea cases across all age groups in China. Our study was aimed at assessing the HuCV-related diarrhea burden and NoV genotypes distribution in southwest China. METHODS: The study was conducted in four hospitals in Kunming city, Yunnan province, from June 2014 to July 2015. Stool specimens were collected from 1,121 diarrhea cases and 319 healthy controls in outpatient departments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect NoV (GI, GII) and SaV. Sequencing was applied to confirm the three viral infections and phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine their genotypes. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of subjects. RESULTS: HuCV was detected at an 11.0 % infection rate in 1,121 diarrhea cases and at 3.4 % rate in 319 non-diarrhea subjects (p \u003C 0.0001, OR = 3.5, 95 % CI 1.8\u20136.5). The prevalence of the NoV genogroup GII and genotype GII.4 in diarrhea cases was significantly higher than that found in healthy controls (p \u003C 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively). NoV GII (n = 118, 10.5 %) was the most common HuCV subtype in diarrhea cases, followed by SaV (n = 3, 0.3 %) and NoV GI (n = 2, 0.2 %). Of 118 NoV GII strains isolated from diarrhea patients. GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %) was the predominant strain, followed by GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %), GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %), GII.17 (n = 8, 6.8 %), and GII.5 (n = 2, 1.7 %). Of the 55 GII.4 strains, the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant had absolutely predominant prevalence (n = 52, 94.5 %), followed by the NoV GII.4-2006b variant (n = 3, 5.5 %). The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in diarrhea cases of the study. CONCLUSIONS: NoV GII was the major genogroup and GII.4 was the most predominant strain detected in diarrhea patients. The GII.17 is an emergent variant in sporadic diarrhea and might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Rapid, accurate detection kits need to be developed to help us find and treat NoV-associated diarrhea in clinical settings in a timely manner.","publish_time":"2016-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Shun-Xian; Li, Li; Yin, Jian-Wen; Jin, Miao; Kong, Xiang-Yu; Pang, Li-Li; Zhou, Yong-Kang; Tian, Li-Guang; Chen, Jia-Xu; Zhou, Xiao-Nong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3718ef8f5fc2e8b32992c568bc66646a870656c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzExOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SaV"],"organizations":["GII","Rapid"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["diarrhea cases","genogroup GII","GII strains","genotype GII","Acute diarrhea","diarrhea patients","associated diarrhea","non-diarrhea subjects","HuCV-related diarrhea burden","leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea","predominant strain","predominant prevalence","characteristics of HuCV","SaV","study","emergent variant","b variant","common HuCV subtype","healthy controls","age groups","major genogroup","clinical symptoms of subjects","clinical settings","genotypes distribution","infection rate","southwest China","global public health","individuals","Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","considerable morbidity","RT-PCR","hospitals","norovirus","Sydney","serious problems","demographic information","Kunming city","Yunnan province","sapovirus","phylogenetic analysis","timely manner","outpatient departments","near future","accurate detection kits","viral infections","mortality","Human caliciviruses","Stool specimens","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Orleans","structured questionnaire","studies","METHODS","RESULTS","Sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases. Our current knowledge of viral mutation rates indicates that viral genetic diversity is determined by multiple virus- and host-dependent processes, and that viral mutation rates can evolve in response to specific selective pressures.","publish_time":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanju\u00E1n, Rafael; Domingo-Calap, Pilar","journal":"Cell Mol Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d51a55b2f7c2277e6435f0ecf13569863cc3adf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5075021.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075021/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rates of spontaneous mutation","DNA viruses","RNA viruses","current knowledge of viral mutation rates","viral genetic diversity","virus-encoded diversity","single-stranded viruses","multiple virus","novo diversity","double-strand virus","host-dependent processes","host-encoded cytidine","template secondary structure","cellular microenvironment","proofreading","sequence context","replication mechanisms","polymerase fidelity","access","different levels","response","environments","adenine deaminases","ability","genome size","new hosts","elements","post-replicative repair","short period of time","specific selective pressures","massive numbers of mutations","remarkable capacity"],"language":"en"},

Children with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) may have tuberculosis, other respiratory tract infections or co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogens. We aimed to identify the presence of potential respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal (NP) samples from children with suspected PTB. METHOD: NP samples collected from consecutive children presenting with suspected PTB at Red Cross Children\u2019s Hospital (Cape Town, South Africa) were tested by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Mycobacterial liquid culture and Xpert MTB/RIF was performed on 2 induced sputa obtained from each participant. Children were categorised as definite-TB (culture or qPCR [Xpert MTB/RIF] confirmed), unlikely-TB (improvement of symptoms without TB treatment on follow-up) and unconfirmed-TB (all other children). RESULTS: Amongst 214 children with a median age of 36 months (interquartile range, [IQR] 19\u201366 months), 34 (16 %) had definite-TB, 86 (40 %) had unconfirmed-TB and 94 (44 %) were classified as unlikely-TB. Moraxella catarrhalis (64 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (42 %), Haemophilus influenzae spp (29 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (22 %) were the most common bacteria detected in NP samples. Other bacteria detected included Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9 %), Bordetella pertussis (7 %) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (4 %). The most common viruses detected included metapneumovirus (19 %), rhinovirus (15 %), influenza virus C (9 %), adenovirus (7 %), cytomegalovirus (7 %) and coronavirus O43 (5.6 %). Both bacteria and viruses were detected in 73, 55 and 56 % of the definite, unconfirmed and unlikely-TB groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the distribution of respiratory microbes between children with and without TB. Using quadratic discriminant analysis, human metapneumovirus, C. pneumoniae, coronavirus 043, influenza virus C virus, rhinovirus and cytomegalovirus best discriminated children with definite-TB from the other groups of children. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of potential respiratory pathogens was detected in children with suspected TB. There was no clear association between TB categorisation and detection of a specific pathogen. Further work is needed to explore potential pathogen interactions and their role in the pathogenesis of PTB.

Thousands of miRNAs regulating approximately 60 % of the total human genome have been identified. They regulate genetic expression either by direct cleavage or by translational repression of the target mRNAs recognized through partial complementary base pairing. The active and functional unit of miRNA is its complex with Argonaute proteins known as the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). De-regulated miRNA expression in the human cell may contribute to a diverse group of disorders including cancer, cardiovascular dysfunctions, liver damage, immunological dysfunction, metabolic syndromes and pathogenic infections. Current day studies have revealed that miRNAs are indeed a pivotal component of host-pathogen interactions and host immune responses toward microorganisms. miRNA is emerging as a tool for genetic study, therapeutic development and diagnosis for human pathogenic infections caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. Many pathogens can exploit the host miRNA system for their own benefit such as surviving inside the host cell, replication, pathogenesis and bypassing some host immune barriers, while some express pathogen-encoded miRNA inside the host contributing to their replication, survival and/or latency. In this review, we discuss the role and significance of miRNA in relation to some pathogenic viruses.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ojha, Chet Raj; Rodriguez, Myosotys; Dever, Seth M.; Mukhopadhyay, Rita; El-Hage, Nazira","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c6c6f69553a11631319fb2653107afee157753c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5081962.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cell","host miRNA system","significance of miRNA","host immune responses","host immune barriers","human cell","De-regulated miRNA expression","pivotal component of host","human pathogenic infections","functional unit of miRNA","express pathogen-encoded miRNA","pathogenic viruses","genetic expression","gene expression","replication","Thousands of miRNAs","regulation of cell differentiation","total human genome","therapeutic development","pathogen interactions","organism development","genetic study","microRNA-induced silencing complex","immunological dysfunction","liver damage","cancer","cardiovascular dysfunctions","diagnosis","target mRNAs","metabolic syndromes","pathogenesis","translational repression","diverse group of disorders","direct cleavage","bacteria","tool","relation","partial complementary base pairing","key roles","Argonaute proteins","metazoans","small non-coding RNAs","miRISC","microorganisms","benefit","parasites","fungi","Current day studies","survival","pathogens","latency"],"language":"en"},

The retrieved articles were also read to further find other articles. Relevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly. Descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary. RESULTS: From June 2012 to April 19, 2016, there were a total of 31 pediatric MERS-CoV cases. Of these cases 13 (42%) were asymptomatic and the male to female ratio was 1.7:1. The mean age of patients was 9.8 \u00B1 5.4 years. Twenty-five (80.6%) of the cases were reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The most common source of infection was household contact (10 of 15 with reported source) and 5 patients acquired infection within a health care facility. Using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of pediatric patients revealed that 9 out of 552 (1.6%) was positive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: Utilizing serology for MERS-CoV infection in Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not reveal any positive patients. Thus, the number of the pediatric MERS-CoV is low; the exact reason for the low prevalence of the disease in children is not known.","publish_time":"2016-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Kattan, Rana F; Memish, Ziad A","journal":"World J Clin Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bc2d0429d1c8168ddb3869ad0a81cebfe5fd8ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5099592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5099592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Saudi Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["pediatric MERS-CoV cases","MERS-CoV infection","positive patients","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Saudi Ministry of Health website","reported source","reported Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","World Health Organization website","Flutracker website","children","common source of infection","mean age of patients","real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of pediatric patients","health care facility","low prevalence","retrieved articles","infancy","keywords","combination","pregnancy","childhood","exact reason","Jordan","associated clinical presentations","household contact","initial discovery","PubMed","serology","final analysis","female ratio","Descriptive analytic statistics","outcomes","disease","number","total","MEDLINE","METHODS","CONCLUSION","AIM","Relevant data","sheet","years","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable cis-acting element named 5\u2032-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5\u2032 terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5\u2032 end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.

Priming induced B cell activation and expansion, AID expression, antibody production and the generation of IgM(\u002B)IgG(-) and IgM(-)IgG(\u002B) antigen-experienced B-cell subsets that persisted in the lymphopenic environment by cell division. Upon secondary transfer and recall the IgM(-)IgG(\u002B) cells responded by the production of antigen-specific IgG while the IgM(\u002B) memory cells secreted mainly IgM and little IgG, but generated new B cells expressing germinal center markers. The recall responses were more efficient if the antigenic boost was delayed suggesting that a period of adaptation is necessary before the transferred cells are able to respond. Overall these findings indicate that reconstitution of a functional and complete memory pool requires transfer of all different antigen-experienced B cell subsets. We also found that the size of the memory B cell pool did not rely on the number of the responding na\u00EFve B cells, suggesting autonomous homeostatic controls for na\u00EFve and memory B cells. By reconstituting a stable memory B cell pool in immune-deficient hosts using a monoclonal high-affinity B cell population we demonstrate the potential value of B cell adoptive immunotherapy.","publish_time":"2016-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anson, Marie; Amado, In\u00EAs; Mailh\u00E9, Marie-Pierre; Donnadieu, Emmanuel; Garcia, Sylvie; Huetz, Fran\u00E7ois; Freitas, Antonio A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4a82ad66962355ffb09e4d1b57fde3e94f0ec53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5120830.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["memory B cells","new B cells","memory cells","stable memory B cell pool","antigen-experienced B-cell subsets","responding na\u00EFve B cells","ability of monoclonal B cells","cell division","different antigen-experienced B cell subsets","Priming induced B cell activation","monoclonal high-affinity B cell population","potential value of B cell adoptive immunotherapy","transferred cells","complete memory pool","little IgG","generation of IgM","specific IgG","secondary T-cell dependent antibody responses","production of antigen","adoptive immune-deficient hosts","antibody production","secondary transfer","recall responses","expansion","autonomous homeostatic controls","AID expression","germinal center markers","number","lymphopenic environment","reconstitution","size","period of adaptation","antigenic boost","findings"],"language":"en"},

To investigate further the infectivity, genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of its causative agent, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), we assessed 129 clinical samples, which were the intestinal tissue of piglets with severe diarrhea, from 17 cities in central China. Both the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1, 1\u2013789 amino acids (aa)) and the full-length ORF3 gene of 21 representative field strains from 21 farms in 11 cities were sequenced and analysed. METHODS: PEDV was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and S1 and ORF3 sequences were processed by the Clustal W method via DNAMAN 8 software, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6 software. RESULTS: The prevalence of PEDV was 92.25% and was detected in 119 of 129 samples, with 94.03% (63 of 67) of pig farms harbouring the disease. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the S1 genes, our isolates all fell into group G2 (variants) and showed a close relationship to isolates from Chinese (HN1303, CH/ZMDZY/11 and AJ1102), Korean (AD01), American (MN, IA1, IA2 and 13\u2013019349) sources, and these isolates differed genetically from other Chinese (LZC, CH/HNZZ/2011 and SD-M) and Korean (SM98) strains as well Japanese (83-P5 and MK) strains. In addition, our isolates differed from attenuated vaccine strains, CV777 (used in China) and DR13 (used in Korea). According to our derived amino acid sequence analysis, we detected one novel variant PEDV, viz: CH/HNLY, with 4-aa insertion/deletion (RSSS/T) at position 375 and 1-aa (D) deletion at position 430 compared to the CV777 attenuated strain. These mutations were located on the receptor binding domain. Our ORF3 gene analyses showed that the prevalent PEDV isolates were variants, and the isolated strains differed genetically from the vaccine strains. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrated the existence of genetic diversity among geographically distinct PEDV strains, and our study has provided an impetus to conduct further research on the PEDV receptor binding protein and on the new and efficacious vaccines design.

Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.

As an outbreak begins, epidemiological investigations and traditional public health responses are generally mounted very quickly. However, patient-centred research is usually not prioritised when planning and enacting the response. Instead, the clinical research response occurs subsequent to and separate from the public health response, and is inadequate for evidence-based decision-making at the bedside or in the offices of public health policymakers. DISCUSSION: The deficiencies of the clinical research response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus demonstrate that current research models do not adequately inform and improve the quality of clinical care or public health response. Three suggestions for improvements are made. First, integrate the data and sample collection needs for clinical and public health decision-making within a unified framework, combined with a risk-based, rather than a discipline-based, approach to ethical review and consent. Second, develop clinical study methods and tools that are specifically designed to meet the epidemiological and contextual challenges of emerging and epidemic infectious diseases. Third, invest in investigator-led clinical research networks that are primed and incentivised to respond to outbreak infections, and which can call on the support and resources of a central centre of excellence. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial that the field of epidemic science matures to place patients at the heart of the response. This can only be achieved when patient-centred research is integrated in the outbreak response from day one and practical steps are taken to reduce the barriers to the generation of reliable and useful evidence.","publish_time":"2016-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rojek, Amanda M.; Horby, Peter W.","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dc1559b4274012d8152b7c5f4ca0d637e8b62fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5165716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5165716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["clinical research response","public health decision-making","outbreak response","clinical research networks","significant public health problem","traditional public health responses","offices of public health policymakers","patient-centred research","quality of clinical care","clinical study methods","current research models","global health security threat","evidence-based decision-making","epidemic infectious diseases","outbreak infections","epidemic infectious disease outbreaks","field of epidemic science","severe acute respiratory syndrome","epidemiological investigations","useful evidence","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","contextual challenges of emerging","pandemic influenza","Ebola virus","sample collection needs","unified framework","bedside","approach","resources","generation of reliable","data","practical steps","BACKGROUND","patients","day","deficiencies","central centre of excellence","ethical review","consent","support","barriers","tools","investigator","discipline","risk","DISCUSSION","heart","suggestions","improvements","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare workers (HCWs) form a significant risk group for infection. Objectives: The aim of this survey was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, infection control practices and educational needs of HCWs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to MERS coronavirus and other emerging infectious diseases. Methods: 1500 of HCWs from Saudi Ministry of Health were invited to fill a questionnaire developed to cover the survey objectives from 9 September 2015 to 8 November 2015. The response rate was about 81%. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise the responses. Results: 1216 HCWs were included in this survey. A total of 56.5% were nurses and 22% were physicians. The most common sources of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) information were the Ministry of Health (MOH) memo (74.3%). Only (47.6%) of the physicians, (30.4%) of the nurses and (29.9%) of the other HCWs were aware that asymptomatic MERS-CoV was described. Around half of respondents who having been investigated for MERS-CoV reported that their work performance decreased while they have suspicion of having MERS-CoV and almost two thirds reported having psychological problems during this period. Almost two thirds of the HCWs (61.2%) reported anxiety about contracting MERS-CoV from patients. Conclusions: The knowledge about emerging infectious diseases was poor and there is need for further education and training programs particularly in the use of personal protective equipment, isolation and infection control measures. The self-reported infection control practices were sub-optimal and seem to be overestimated.","publish_time":"2016-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsahafi, Abdullah J.; Cheng, Allen C.","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb6e2916b4a94b8c8a3e7d58f70158dc04191503.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5201355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5201355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","Saudi Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS coronavirus","asymptomatic MERS-CoV","common sources of MERS","self-reported infection control practices","infection control measures","educational needs of HCWs","survey objectives","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Saudi Ministry of Health","knowledge","emerging infectious diseases","thirds","nurses","physicians","isolation","prolonged outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","use of personal protective equipment","attitudes","information","significant risk group","suspicion","training programs","work performance","psychological problems","MOH","memo","Conclusions","questionnaire","Background","anxiety","Healthcare workers","period","aim","Methods","patients","Descriptive statistics","half of respondents","response rate","responses","total","Results"],"language":"en"},

Translation initiation is a highly regulated and rate-limiting step of protein synthesis that requires more than 12 eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Extensive evidence shows that the transcriptome and corresponding proteome do not invariably correlate with each other in a variety of contexts. In particular, translation of mRNAs specific to angiogenesis, tumor development, and apoptosis is altered during physiological and pathophysiological stress conditions. In cancer cells, the expression and functions of eIFs are hampered, resulting in the inhibition of global translation and enhancement of translation of subsets of mRNAs by alternative mechanisms. A precise understanding of mechanisms involving eukaryotic initiation factors leading to differential protein expression can help us to design better strategies to diagnose and treat cancer. The high spatial and temporal resolution of translation control can have an immediate effect on the microenvironment of the cell in comparison with changes in transcription. The dysregulation of mRNA translation mechanisms is increasingly being exploited as a target to treat cancer. In this review, we will focus on this context by describing both canonical and noncanonical roles of eIFs, which alter mRNA translation.","publish_time":"2016-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Divya Khandige; Bressler, Kamiko; Patel, Harshil; Balasingam, Nirujah; Thakor, Nehal","journal":"J Nucleic Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7ddd78bba691e9200cece8a05b3486fab895885.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5204094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA translation initiation","enhancement of translation","dysregulation of mRNA translation mechanisms","translation of mRNAs specific","inhibition of global translation","temporal resolution of translation control","eukaryotic initiation factors","differential protein expression","alternative mechanisms","step of protein synthesis","functions of eIFs","cancer cells","precise understanding of mechanisms","noncanonical roles of eIFs","subsets of mRNAs","angiogenesis","distinct phases","apoptosis","tumor development","elongation","immediate effect","transcriptome","comparison","microenvironment","pathophysiological stress conditions","changes","transcription","termination","Extensive evidence","corresponding proteome","better strategies","variety of contexts","target","review"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we review different applications of such an approach that uses spherical Gaussian functions of fixed standard deviation, referred to as pseudoatoms. Some of these applications use EM-map normal mode analysis (NMA) with elastic network model (ENM) (applications such as predicting conformational changes of macromolecular complexes or exploring actual conformational changes by normal-mode-based analysis of experimental data) while some other do not use NMA (denoising of EM density maps). In applications based on NMA and ENM, the advantage of using pseudoatoms in EM-map coarse-grain models is that the ENM springs are easily assigned among neighboring grains thanks to their spherical shape and uniformed size.

Although these forests are generally found sparsely distributed along rivers, their occurrence is not thought to be (clearly) driven by edaphic conditions but rather by trait combinations of G. dewevrei that aid in achieving monodominance. Functional community structure between these monodominant and mixed forests has, however, not yet been compared. Additionally, little is known about nondominant species in the monodominant forest community. These two topics are addressed in this study. We investigate the functional community structure of 10 one\u2010hectare plots of monodominant and mixed forests in a central region of the Congo basin, in DR Congo. Thirteen leaf and wood traits are measured, covering 95% (basal area weighted) of all species present in the plots, including leaf nutrient contents, leaf isotopic compositions, specific leaf area, wood density, and vessel anatomy. The trait\u2010based assessment of G. dewevrei shows an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable for its location near forest rivers. Moreover, indications have been found for N and P limitations in the monodominant forest, possibly related to ectomycorrhizal associations formed with G. dewevrei. Reduced leaf N and P contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest and for different nondominant groups, as compared to those in the mixed forest. In summary, this work shows that environmental filtering does prevail in the monodominant G. dewevrei forest, leading to lower functional diversity in this forest type, with the dominant species showing beneficial traits related to its common riverine locations and with reduced soil N and P availability found in this environment, both coregulating the tree community assembly.","publish_time":"2016-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kearsley, Elizabeth; Verbeeck, Hans; Hufkens, Koen; Van de Perre, Frederik; Doetterl, Sebastian; Baert, Geert; Beeckman, Hans; Boeckx, Pascal; Huygens, Dries","journal":"Ecol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a60dfb6c229545c43c3e7a931f97b88b63f87abd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5216677.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Congo"],"keyphrases":["monodominant forest community","dewevrei forest","Monodominant patches of forest","forest rivers","forest type","mixed forests","hectare plots of monodominant","Reduced leaf N","Functional community structure","nondominant species","Gilbertiodendron dewevrei","community level","specific leaf area","leaf nutrient contents","P contents","wood traits","species present","high species diversity","tree community assembly","central African tropical forests","reduced soil N","P availability","beneficial traits","ensemble of traits","P limitations","lower functional diversity","central region","wood density","Congo basin","basal area","DR Congo","trait combinations of","different nondominant groups","isotopic compositions","common riverine locations","water use","transport","coregulating","vessel anatomy","environmental filtering","based assessment of","ectomycorrhizal associations","work","edaphic conditions","summary","topics","study","occurrence","indications","monodominance"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we evaluate a TaqMan protocol using two identically labelled hydrolysis probes (simple, LNA (locked-nucleic-acid)) and MGB (minor-groove-binder) modified probes and combinations thereof in a single assay. Our results based on a synthetic amplicon suggest that the second probe does not compromise the TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR parameters, which repeatedly and reproducibly remained comparable to those of the corresponding single-probe assays, irrespective of the relative probe orientation, whether opposite or tandem, and probe modifications or combinations thereof. On the other hand, the second probe additively contributed to the overall fluorescence signal. The utility of the dual-probe approach was demonstrated on practical examples by using field specimens.

However, 10\u201320% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia which contributes to considerable morbidity. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood. The present study investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and host human components. METHODOLOGY: Bioinformatic tools were used to identify peptides of CHIKV E1 exhibiting similarity to host components. Two peptides (A\u0026B) were identified using several bioinformatic tools, synthesised and used to validate the results obtained in silico. An ELISA was designed to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples from CHIKV patients to these peptides. Further, experiments were conducted in a C57BL/6J experimental mouse model to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were indeed capable of inducing pathology. FINDINGS: The serum samples showed reactivity of varying degrees, indicating that these peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection. Further, these peptides when injected into C57BL/6J mice were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice, similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology in the skeletal muscles as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone. Collectively these observations validate the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 protein and host proteins does contribute to pathology in CHIKV infection.","publish_time":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reddy, Vijayalakshmi; Desai, Anita; Krishna, Shankar Susarla; Vasanthapuram, Ravi","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/977007f901c5697f613ad1b475532ebaf7baef86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5268390.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5268390/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV peptides","peptides of CHIKV E1","CHIKV infection","CHIKV patients","CHIKV E1 glycoprotein","CHIKV E1 protein","animals","muscles of C57BL","host proteins","J mice","host human components","peptide B","host immune system","Bioinformatic tools","possible occurrence of molecular mimicry","enhanced inflammatory pathology","immunoreactivity of serum samples","exact molecular mechanisms","capable of inducing pathology","skeletal muscles","J experimental mouse model","persistent arthralgia","Chikungunya virus","fever","self limited illness","reemerging pathogen","significant inflammation","headache","reactivity of varying degrees","hypothesis","subsequent injection","similarity","present study","considerable morbidity","myalgia","manifestations","FINDINGS","observations","BACKGROUND","individuals","METHODOLOGY","results","silico","ELISA","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Inter-hospital transfer of patients on ECMO support can be life-threatening. In this study, we report a single-center experience and a systematic review of the available published data on complications and mortality associated with ECMO transportation. METHODS: We reported single-center data regarding complications and mortality associated with the transportation of patients on ECMO support. Additionally, we searched multiple databases for case series, observational studies, and randomized controlled trials regarding mortality of patients transferred on ECMO support. Results were analyzed independently for pediatric (under 12 years old) and adult populations. We pooled mortality rates using a random-effects model. Complications and transportation data were also described. RESULTS: A total of 38 manuscripts, including our series, were included in the final analysis, totaling 1481 patients transported on ECMO support. A total of 951 patients survived to hospital discharge. The pooled survival rates for adult and pediatric patients were 62% (95% CI 57\u201368) and 68% (95% CI 60\u201375), respectively. Two deaths occurred during patient transportation. No other complication resulting in adverse outcome was reported.

The murine model of BA, employing rhesus rotavirus (RRV), parallels human disease and has been used to elucidate mechanistic aspects of a virus induced biliary cholangiopathy. We previously reported that RRV VP4 gene plays an integral role in activating the immune system and induction of BA. Utilizing rotavirus binding and blocking assays, this study elucidated how RRV VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte susceptibility to infection both in vitro and in vivo in the murine model of BA. We identified the amino acid sequence on VP4 and its cholangiocyte binding protein, finding that the sequence is specific to those rotavirus strains which cause an obstructive cholangiopathy. Pretreatment of murine and human cholangiocytes with this VP4 derived peptide (TRTRVSRLY), significantly reduced RRV\u2019s ability to bind and infect the cells. However, the peptide did not block cholangiocyte binding of TUCH and Ro1845, strains which do not induce murine BA. The SRL sequence within TRTRVSRLY is required for cholangiocyte binding and viral replication. The cholangiocyte membrane protein bound by SRL was found to be Hsc70. Inhibition of Hsc70 by siRNAs reduced RRV\u2019s ability to infect cholangiocytes. This virus-cholangiocyte interaction is also seen in vivo in the murine model of BA, where inoculation of mice with TRTRVSRLY peptide significantly reduced symptoms and mortality in RRV-injected mice. CONCLUSION: The tri-peptide SRL on RRV VP4 binds to the cholangiocyte membrane protein Hsc70 defining a novel binding site governing VP4 attachment. Investigations are underway to determine the cellular response following this interaction to understand how it contributes to the pathogenesis of BA.","publish_time":"2017-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohanty, Sujit K.; Donnelly, Bryan; Lobeck, Inna; Walther, Ashley; Dupree, Phylicia; Coots, Abigail; Meller, Jaroslaw; McNeal, Monica; Sestak, Karol; Tiao, Greg","journal":"Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be876520214fb418dd059a5c06052d763dae7274.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5360466.xml.json","url":"https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hep.28947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRV","BA","TUCH","SRL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["murine BA","cholangiocyte binding protein","RRV VP4 protein","murine model of BA","cholangiocyte binding of TUCH","RRV VP4 gene","rotavirus binding","cholangiocyte membrane protein Hsc70","cholangiocyte susceptibility","induction of BA","pathogenesis of BA","VP4 derived peptide","virus-cholangiocyte interaction","TRTRVSRLY peptide","SRL sequence","Pretreatment of murine","RRV-injected mice","tri-peptide SRL","novel binding site governing VP4 attachment","rotavirus strains","biliary cholangiopathy","reduced RRV\u2019s ability","human cholangiocytes","reduced symptoms","rhesus rotavirus","Inhibition of Hsc70","neonatal obstructive cholangiopathy","human disease","amino acid sequence","inoculation of mice","Biliary atresia","stage liver disease","mortality","integral role","immune system","siRNAs","study","Ro1845","assays","infection","cellular response","mechanistic aspects","transplantation","CONCLUSION","viral replication","Investigations","cells"],"language":"en"},

We show that SIRT7 interacts with numerous proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, the majority of interactions requiring ongoing transcription. In addition to its role in Pol I transcription, we found that SIRT7 also regulates transcription of snoRNAs and mRNAs. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, which activates transcription by phosphorylating serine 2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II.

Although a sizable proportion of deaths by suicide may be preventable, it is well documented that despite major governmental and international investments in research, education and clinical practice suicide rates have not diminished and are even increasing among several at-risk populations. Although nonhuman animals do not engage in suicidal behavior amenable to translational studies, we argue that animal model systems are necessary to investigate candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behavior and the neurobiology underlying these endophenotypes. Animal models are similarly a critical resource to help delineate treatment targets and pharmacological means to improve our ability to manage the risk of suicide. In particular, certain pathophysiological pathways to suicidal behavior, including stress and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis dysfunction, neurotransmitter system abnormalities, endocrine and neuroimmune changes, aggression, impulsivity and decision-making deficits, as well as the role of critical interactions between genetic and epigenetic factors, development and environmental risk factors can be modeled in laboratory animals. We broadly describe human biological findings, as well as protective effects of medications such as lithium, clozapine, and ketamine associated with modifying risk of engaging in suicidal behavior that are readily translatable to animal models. Endophenotypes of suicidal behavior, studied in animal models, are further useful for moving observed associations with harmful environmental factors (for example, childhood adversity, mechanical trauma aeroallergens, pathogens, inflammation triggers) from association to causation, and developing preventative strategies. Further study in animals will contribute to a more informed, comprehensive, accelerated and ultimately impactful suicide research portfolio.","publish_time":"2017-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gould, T D; Georgiou, P; Brenner, L A; Brundin, L; Can, A; Courtet, P; Donaldson, Z R; Dwivedi, Y; Guillaume, S; Gottesman, I I; Kanekar, S; Lowry, C A; Renshaw, P F; Rujescu, D; Smith, E G; Turecki, G; Zanos, P; Zarate, C A; Zunszain, P A; Postolache, T T","journal":"Transl Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c45774aa60b963b21073c80de51727bf75a994d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5416692.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5416692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of suicide","suicidal behavior amenable","candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behavior","Animal models","environmental risk factors","impactful suicide research portfolio","epigenetic factors","harmful environmental factors","clinical practice suicide rates","modifying risk","animal model systems","laboratory animals","nonhuman animals","critical resource","role of critical interactions","neurotransmitter system abnormalities","adrenal axis dysfunction","mechanical trauma aeroallergens","neuroimmune changes","pathogens","childhood adversity","example","education","inflammation triggers","aggression","pituitary","stress","development","international investments","translational studies","certain pathophysiological pathways","lithium","causation","impulsivity","treatment targets","observed associations","protective effects of medications","pharmacological means","clozapine","decision-making deficits","ketamine","ability","neurobiology","sizable proportion of deaths","human biological findings","leading cause of death","preventative strategies","at-risk populations","study"],"language":"en"},

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) has improved the diagnostic yield of pathogens, and it is easier to identify the co-infections also. The present study was done to evaluate the performance of MPCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Atotal of 177 BAL specimens collected over a 19 months period from immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness were analyzed with the MPCR and aerobic culture. Patients were divided into four according to the pathogens. Category V (only viral), Category NV (nonviral, i.e., bacteria and atypical), Category M (mixed, i.e., both viral and nonviral pathogen), and Category UK (unknown etiology). RESULTS: MPCR identified the causative pathogen in 59.3% of patients while culture could identify only in 37.8% of patients. Most frequent etiological agent was Klebsiella pneumoniae (32%), followed by cytomegalovirus (21%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (10%).

RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies have suggested that over-expression of GPC3 is associated with a poorer prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Expression of GPC3 leads to an increased apoptosis response in human lung carcinoma tumor cells, and is considered to be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene. Increased serum levels of GPC3 have been demonstrated in ARDS patients with severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Glypican-3 could be considered as a clinically useful biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and ARDS, but further research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings.","publish_time":"2017-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chaolei; Huang, Xiaomin; Ying, Zhaojian; Wu, Dengmin; Yu, Yani; Wang, Xiangdong; Chen, Chengshui","journal":"Clin Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78975983bf070abbad4003baded3a5bdc8f95fe6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5433957.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433957/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepatocellular carcinoma patients","over-expression of GPC3","potential involvement of GPC3","changes of GPC3 gene","human lung carcinoma tumor cells","lung cancer","severe pneumonia","ARDS patients","Increased serum levels of GPC3","candidate lung tumor suppressor gene","potential biomarker candidate","protein expression","useful biomarker","Glypican","disease-specific biomarker","cell biology","increased apoptosis response","cell surface-bound proteoglycan","regulation","acute respiratory distress syndrome","poorer prognosis","Immunohistochemical studies","utility","RESULTS","review","BACKGROUND","aim","CONCLUSIONS","research","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, the development of systemically delivered antisense therapeutics has been hampered by poor tissue penetration and cellular uptake, including crossing of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to reach targets in the central nervous system (CNS). For SMA application, we have investigated the ability of various BBB-crossing peptides for CNS delivery of a splice-switching phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) targeting survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7 inclusion. We identified a branched derivative of the well-known ApoE (141\u2013150) peptide, which as a PMO conjugate was capable of exon inclusion in the CNS following systemic administration, leading to an increase in the level of full-length SMN2 transcript. Treatment of newborn SMA mice with this peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugate resulted in a significant increase in the average lifespan and gains in weight, muscle strength, and righting reflexes. Systemic treatment of adult SMA mice with this newly identified P-PMO also resulted in small but significant increases in the levels of SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) exon inclusion in the CNS and peripheral tissues. This work provides proof of principle for the ability to select new peptide paradigms to enhance CNS delivery and activity of a PMO SSO through use of a peptide-based delivery platform for the treatment of SMA potentially extending to other neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shabanpoor, Fazel; Hammond, Suzan M; Abendroth, Frank; Hazell, Gareth; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Gait, Michael J.","journal":"Nucleic Acid Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e8f150cd587ddd87cd4220351db7f0b6cd1e006.json; document_parses/pdf_json/08ac8987e585268b0664efc52bc4abbfda31249d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5467147.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5467147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","PMO","PMO SSO","SMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide-PMO","CNS delivery","PMO conjugate","treatment of SMA","PMO SSO","identified P-PMO","Splice","SMA application","Treatment of newborn SMA mice","Systemic treatment of adult SMA mice","capable of exon inclusion","peptide-based delivery platform","new peptide paradigms","antisense oligonucleotides","neuromuscular diseases","crossing","ability of various BBB","significant increases","level of full-length SMN2 transcript","systemic administration","antisense therapeutics","neurodegenerative diseases","levels of SMN2 pre-messenger RNA","Duchenne muscular dystrophy","spinal muscular atrophy","mRNA","weight","gains","DMD","use","activity","peptides","muscle strength","cellular uptake","survival motor neuron","average lifespan","poor tissue penetration","emerging treatments","phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide","targets","clinical trials","blood","brain barrier","central nervous system","SSOs","righting reflexes","well-known ApoE","proof of principle","peripheral tissues","branched derivative","work","development"],"language":"en"},

Zika NS2B-NS3pro is essential for the proteolysis of the viral polyprotein and thereby viral replication. Thus NS2B-NS3pro represents an attractive target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design. Here, we have characterized the solution conformations and catalytic parameters of both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes and found that the unlinked complex manifested well-dispersed NMR spectra. Subsequently with selective isotope-labeling using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that C-terminal residues (R73-K100) of NS2B is highly disordered without any stable tertiary and secondary structures in the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex in the free state. Upon binding to the well-characterized serine protease inhibitor, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), only the extreme C-terminal residues (L86-K100) remain disordered. Additionally, we have identified five flavonoids and one natural phenol rich in edible plants including fruits and vegetables, which inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in a non-competitive mode, with Ki ranging from 770 nM for Myricetin to 34.02 \u03BCM for Apigenin. Molecular docking showed that they all bind to a pocket on the back of the active site and their structure-activity relationship was elucidated. Our study provides valuable insights into the solution conformation of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further deciphers its susceptibility towards allosteric inhibition by natural products. As these natural product inhibitors fundamentally differ from the currently-known active site inhibitors in terms of both inhibitory mode and chemical scaffold, our finding might open a new avenue for development of better allosteric inhibitors to fight ZIKV infection.","publish_time":"2017-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Amrita; Lim, Liangzhong; Srivastava, Shagun; Lu, Yimei; Song, Jianxing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dd28ef7fb600a0ca94980bcf6e5cbccf52a77fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5503262.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5503262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes","solution conformation of Zika NS2B-NS3pro","recent Zika viral","anti-Zika drug discovery","active site inhibitors","natural product inhibitors","viral polyprotein","natural products","viral replication","development of better allosteric inhibitors","extreme C-terminal residues","natural phenol rich","well-characterized serine protease inhibitor","unlinked complex manifested well-dispersed NMR spectra","inhibitory mode","allosteric inhibition","L86-K100","non-competitive mode","NMR spectroscopy","R73-K100","solution conformations","ZIKV infection","bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor","attractive target","neonatal microcephaly","edible plants","BPTI","fruits","terms","epidemic","secondary structures","new avenue","Guillain-Barre syndrome","severe neurological pathologies","finding","stable tertiary","susceptibility","vegetables","chemical scaffold","valuable insights","catalytic parameters","Myricetin","vaccine","binding","design","proteolysis","structure-activity relationship","free state","\u03BCM","medication","selective isotope","study","flavonoids","Apigenin","Molecular docking","pocket"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that prophylaxis with a multimechanistic monoclonal antibody (MAb) combination against alpha-toxin (MEDI4893*) and ClfA (11H10) provided greater strain coverage and improved efficacy in an S. aureus lethal bacteremia model. Subsequently, 11H10 was found to exhibit reduced affinity and impaired inhibition of fibrinogen binding to ClfA002 expressed by members of a predominant hospital-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clone, ST5. Consequently, we identified another anti-ClfA MAb (SAR114) from human tonsillar B cells with \u003E100-fold increased affinity for three prominent ClfA variants, including ClfA002, and potent inhibition of bacterial agglutination by 112 diverse clinical isolates. We next constructed bispecific Abs (BiSAbs) comprised of 11H10 or SAR114 as IgG scaffolds and grafted anti-alpha-toxin (MEDI4893*) single-chain variable fragment to the amino or carboxy terminus of the anti-ClfA heavy chains. Although the BiSAbs exhibited in vitro potencies similar to those of the parental MAbs, only 11H10-BiSAb, but not SAR114-BiSAb, showed protective activity in murine infection models comparable to the respective MAb combination. In vivo activity with SAR114-BiSAb was observed in infection models with S. aureus lacking ClfA. Our data suggest that high-affinity binding to ClfA sequesters the SAR114-BiSAb to the bacterial surface, thereby reducing both alpha-toxin neutralization and protection in vivo. These results indicate that a MAb combination targeting ClfA and alpha-toxin is more promising for future development than the corresponding BiSAb.","publish_time":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tkaczyk, C.; Kasturirangan, S.; Minola, A.; Jones-Nelson, O.; Gunter, V.; Shi, Y.

The new yellow phosphor is obtained by extraction of Phellodendron chinense Schneid. The emission wavelength, full width at half maximum and CIE coordinates of extracted Phellodendron are 540 nm, 120 nm and (0.41, 0.55), respectively. The corresponding luminescent properties of Phellodendron are characterized by PL, PLE, reflection spectra, FITR and decay lifetime. Surprising thing is luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphors excited at 380 nm was stronger than YAG:Ce phosphor by more than 139%.

One of the complications of dengue is dehydration which, if not carefully monitored and treated, may lead to shock, particularly in those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. WHO has recommended oral fluid intake of five glasses or more for adults who are suspected to have dengue fever. However, there have been no published studies looking at self-care intervention measures to improve oral fluid intake among patients suspected of dengue fever. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using a fluid chart to improve oral fluid intake in patients with suspected dengue fever in a primary care setting. METHODS: This feasibility study used a randomized controlled study design. The data was collected over two months at a primary care clinic in a teaching hospital. The inclusion criteria were: age \u003E 12 years, patients who were suspected to have dengue fever based on the assessment by the primary healthcare clinician, fever for \u003E three days, and thrombocytopenia (platelets \u003C 150 x 10(9)/L). Both groups received a dengue home care card. The intervention group received the fluid chart and a cup (200ml). Baseline clinical and laboratory data, 24-hour fluid recall (control group), and fluid chart were collected. The main outcomes were: hospitalization rates, intravenous fluid requirement and total oral fluid intake. FINDINGS: Among the 138 participants who were included in the final analysis, there were fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group (n = 7, 10.0%) than the control group (n = 12, 17.6%) (p = 0.192). Similarly, fewer patients (n = 9, 12.9%) in the intervention group required intravenous fluid compared to the control group (n = 15, 22.1%), (p = 0.154). There was an increase in the amount of daily oral fluid intake in the intervention group (about 3,000 ml) compared to the control group (about 2,500 ml, p = 0.521). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This is a feasible and acceptable study to perform in a primary care setting. The fluid chart is a simple, inexpensive tool that may reduce hospitalization and intravenous fluid requirement in suspected dengue patients. A randomized controlled trial with larger sample size is needed to determine this conclusively.

Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), have been discovered to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or \u201Cempty\u201D capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the dual effects of the core protein allosteric modulators on nucleocapsid assembly and disassembly will facilitate the discovery of novel core protein-targeting antiviral agents that can more efficiently suppress cccDNA synthesis and cure chronic hepatitis B.","publish_time":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Fang; Zhao, Qiong; Sheraz, Muhammad; Cheng, Junjun; Qi, Yonghe; Su, Qing; Cuconati, Andrea; Wei, Lai; Du, Yanming; Li, Wenhui; Chang, Jinhong; Guo, Ju-Tao","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee019cb6808f738c245cc9de12b08a19951ef594.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5629035.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5629035/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disassembly of nucleocapsids","core protein structure","pathway of core protein assembly","viral DNA polymerase","core protein allosteric modulators","discovery of novel core protein","shaped core protein aggregates","double-stranded DNA","cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids","structural changes of nucleocapsids","ability of mature nucleocapsids","cccDNA formation","reverse transcriptional DNA replication","inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly","accelerating cccDNA synthesis","HAPs","SBAs","subsequent viral genome replication","novo infection of hepatocytes","capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA","mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating","chronic hepatitis","Hepatitis B virus","HBV","pg","dual effects","intracellular amplification pathways","kinetics","heteroaryldihydropyrimidines","biosynthesis","elongation of positive","antiviral agents","closed circular","addition","place","CpAMs","virions","chemotypes of small molecules","molecular mechanism","sulfamoylbenzamides","studies"],"language":"en"},

Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds.

This study aims to evaluate the rate of both colonisations and infections related to ECMO devices at the time of ECMO removal. RESULTS: We included all consecutive adult patients treated with venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO) for at least 48 h during a 34-month study. At the time of ECMO removal, blood cultures, swab cultures on insertion cannula site and intravascular cannula extremity cultures were systematically performed. Each ECMO device was classified according to the infectious status into three groups: (1) uninfected/uncolonised ECMO device, (2) ECMO device colonisation and (3) ECMO device infection. Ninety-nine patients underwent 103 VV-ECMO, representing 1472 ECMO days. The ECMO device infection rate was 9.7% (10 events), including 7 ECMO device-related bloodstream infections (6.8%). The ECMO device colonisation rate was 32% (33 events). No difference was observed between the three groups, regarding days of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality. We observed a longer ECMO duration in the ECMO device colonisation group as compared to the uninfected/uncolonised ECMO device group [12 (9\u201320 days) vs. 5 days (5\u201316 days), respectively, p \u003C 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of ECMO removal, systematic blood culture and intravascular extremity cannula culture may help to diagnose ECMO device-related infection. We reported a quite low infection rate related to ECMO device. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of systematic strategies of cannula culture at the time of ECMO removal.

Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact insects, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral transmission by its insect vector. Together, these results indicate a plant virus can induce the formation of autophagosomes for carrying virions, thus facilitating viral spread and transmission by its insect vector. We believe that such a role for virus-induced autophagy is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors.","publish_time":"2017-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yong; Chen, Qian; Li, Manman; Mao, Qianzhuo; Chen, Hongyan; Wu, Wei; Jia, Dongsheng; Wei, Taiyun","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b92029ab36511c3072b0a3cba99c6dbca29097cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5708841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral spread","efficient viral transmission","viral infection","viral pathogens","insect vectors","virus-induced autophagy","inhibiting autophagy","activation of autophagy","autophagy inhibitor","nonlytic viral release","plant virus","autophagy inducer rapamycin","cultured leafhopper vector cells","appearance of obvious virus","cultured cells","rice gall dwarf virus","persistent viruses","formation of autophagosomes","double-membrane autophagosomes","plant reovirus","persistent replication","expression of Atg5","expression of Torc1","conversion of ATG8","leafhopper intestine","autophagic process","increased level of autophagic flux","RGDV","intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism","intact insects","methyladenine","virions","health problems","role","results"],"language":"en"},

Although febrile events are commonly culture\u2010negative, gram\u2010positive infections are the most frequent source of culture\u2010positive infections, but gram\u2010negative infections represent a significant risk of mortality in AML and MDS patients treated with decitabine.","publish_time":"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Alaa M.; Weisel, Daniel; Gao, Feng; Uy, Geoffrey L.; Cashen, Amanda F.; Jacoby, Meagan A.; Wartman, Lukas D.; Ghobadi, Armin; Pusic, Iskra; Romee, Rizwan; Fehniger, Todd A.; Stockerl\u2010Goldstein, Keith E.; Vij, Ravi; Oh, Stephen T.; Abboud, Camille N.; Schroeder, Mark A.; Westervelt, Peter; DiPersio, John F.; Welch, John S.","journal":"Cancer Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a215215f74fbf094c929a521c28cacc1fef4dcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5727246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5727246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDS","Washington University School of Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MDS patients","unfit patients","day decitabine","gram\u2010negative infections","gram\u2010positive infections","culture results","gram\u2010negative events","gram\u2010positive events","AML","risk of infections","day cycles of decitabine","related complications","related mortality","decitabine treatment","febrile events","gram\u2010negative bacteria","gram\u2010positive bacteria","frequent source of culture","cycle of therapy","related serious adverse event","significant risk of mortality","infectious complications","later cycles","intensity therapy","acute myeloid leukemia","Washington University School of Medicine","prospective clinical study","myelodysplastic syndromes","incidence","average","summary"],"language":"en"},

The E-S-FLU virus is a single-cycle influenza virus coated with Ebolavirus glycoprotein, and it encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein as a reporter that replaces the influenza virus hemagglutinin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express Ebolavirus glycoprotein as a stable transmembrane protein for E-S-FLU virus production. Infection of cells with the E-S-FLU virus was dependent on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is the well-characterized receptor for Ebola virus entry at the late endosome/lysosome membrane. The E-S-FLU virus was neutralized specifically by an anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody and a variety of small drug molecules that are known to inhibit the entry of wild-type Ebola virus. To demonstrate the application of this new Ebola virus pseudotype, we show that a single laboratory batch was sufficient to screen a library (LOPAC(1280); Sigma) of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of virus entry. A total of 215 compounds inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection, while only 22 inhibited the control H5-S-FLU virus coated in H5 hemagglutinin. These inhibitory compounds have very dispersed targets and mechanisms of action, e.g., calcium channel blockers, estrogen receptor antagonists, antihistamines, serotonin uptake inhibitors, etc., and this correlates with inhibitor screening results obtained with other pseudotypes or wild-type Ebola virus in the literature. The E-S-FLU virus is a new tool for Ebola virus cell entry studies and is easily applied to high-throughput screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus is in the Filoviridae family and is a biosafety level 4 pathogen. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ebola virus. These characteristics warrant the development of surrogates for Ebola virus that can be handled in more convenient laboratory containment to study the biology of the virus and screen for inhibitors. Here we characterized a new surrogate, named E-S-FLU virus, that is based on a disabled influenza virus core coated with the Ebola virus surface protein but does not contain any genetic information from the Ebola virus itself. We show that E-S-FLU virus uses the same cell entry pathway as wild-type Ebola virus. As an example of the ease of use of E-S-FLU virus in biosafety level 1/2 containment, we showed that a single production batch could provide enough surrogate virus to screen a standard small-molecule library of 1,280 candidates for inhibitors of viral entry.","publish_time":"2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Julie Huiyuan; Rijal, Pramila; Schimanski, Lisa; Tharkeshwar, Arun Kumar; Wright, Edward; Annaert, Wim; Townsend, Alain","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d521a22ac03c5c56e1ca2aea0e90f322b348851b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5790926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus entry","surrogate virus","IMPORTANCE Ebola virus","FLU virus production","FLU virus infection","inhibition of virus entry","wild-type Ebola virus","new Ebola virus pseudotype","Ebola virus surface protein","influenza virus hemagglutinin","E-S","Ebola virus cell entry studies","single-cycle influenza virus","disabled influenza virus core","control H5-S","entry of wild","inhibitors of viral entry","cell entry pathway","small-molecule inhibitors","new surrogate","biosafety level","single laboratory batch","new tool","single production batch","convenient laboratory containment","standard small-molecule library","stable transmembrane protein","anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody","serotonin uptake inhibitors","active compounds","inhibitory compounds","laboratory analysis","H5 hemagglutinin","Infection of cells","enhanced green fluorescence protein","Niemann-Pick C1 protein","well-characterized receptor","variety of small drug molecules","estrogen receptor antagonists","inhibitor screening results","MDCK-SIAT1 cells","high-throughput screening assays","antihistamines","reporter","calcium channel blockers","pseudotypes","candidates","late endosome","mechanisms of action","Filoviridae family","dispersed targets","biology","ease of use","correlates","development of surrogates","FDA-approved therapeutics","application","lysosome membrane","genetic information","LOPAC","Sigma","antibodies","literature","characteristics","example","pathogen","total"],"language":"en"},

The revision process not only modified the definition of influenza-like illness, to include a simplified list of the criteria shown to be most predictive of influenza infection, but also clarified the language used for the definition, to enhance interpretability. To capture severe cases of influenza that required hospitalization, a new case definition was also developed for severe acute respiratory infection in all age groups.

A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207\u2013222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them.

Due to the high complexity of this immunological syndrome development of novel therapeutic strategies is urgent. Promising drug targets or biomarkers may depict aquaporins (AQPs) as they regulate crucial key mechanisms of sepsis. MAIN BODY: Here we report on base of the current literature that several AQPs are involved in different physiological processes of sepsis. In immune system mainly AQPs 3, 5 and 9 seem to be important, as they regulate the migration of different immune cells. Several studies showed that AQP3 is essential for T cell function and macrophage migration and that AQP5 and AQP9 regulate neutrophil cell migration and impact sepsis survival. Additionally, to the function in immune system AQPs 1 and 5 play a role in sepsis induced lung injury and their downregulation after inflammatory stimuli impair lung injury. By contrast, AQP4 expression is up-regulated during brain inflammation and aggravates brain edema in sepsis. In kidney AQP2 expression is downregulated during sepsis and can cause renal failure. Some studies also suggest a role of AQP1 in cardiac function. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, AQPs are involved in many physiological dysfunctions in sepsis and their expressions are differently regulated. Additional research on the regulatory mechanisms of aquaporins may identify potential therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2018-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rump, Katharina; Adamzik, Michael","journal":"Cell Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5d31671d36e0de8f9bdb9a9f9a2827e7f087e8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5807818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807818/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact sepsis survival","immune system AQPs","sepsis induced lung injury","different physiological processes of sepsis","crucial key mechanisms of sepsis","migration of different immune cells","neutrophil cell migration","macrophage migration","T cell function","cardiac function","studies","CONCLUSION","regulatory mechanisms of aquaporins","potential therapeutic targets","role of AQP1","brain edema","brain inflammation","physiological dysfunctions","AQP4 expression","common cause of death","Promising drug targets","kidney AQP2 expression","immunological syndrome development of novel therapeutic strategies","downregulation","AQP9","AQP5","inflammatory stimuli","AQP3","biomarkers","intensive care units","high complexity","Additional research","base","current literature","BACKGROUND","expressions","contrast","renal failure","MAIN BODY"],"language":"en"},

We developed a poxvirus platform vaccine with improved immunogenicity and inserted the mesothelin gene to create an anti-mesothelin cancer vaccine. Mesothelin expression is mostly restricted to tumors in adult mammals and thus may be a good target for cancer treatment. We show here that the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing mesothelin and the enhanced MVA virus missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene and expressing mesothelin were both safe in mice and were able to induce IFN-gamma secreting T cells in response to mesothelin expressing tumor cells. In addition, the MVA virus has oncolytic properties in vitro as it can replicate in and kill Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line tumor cells, even though it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells. Deletion of the A35 gene in MVA improved T cell responses as expected. However, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of Panc02 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice with pre-vaccination of mice, boosts, or even intratumoral injections of the recombinant viruses. Vaccine efficacy may be limited by shedding of mesothelin from tumor cells thus creating a protective screen from the immune system.","publish_time":"2018-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, Michael; Freistaedter, Andrew; Jones, Gwendolyn J.

The ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real-time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks. However, the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and privacy requirements for de-identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata. In the United States, dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers. Admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in Department of Health and Human Services guidance. To understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates, we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department between 2010 and 2017. Across all positive microbiological tests, the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8% of tests. Collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7% and 96.5% of the time, respectively, with \u003E99% of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date. Samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients. We show that PHI-associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date. We suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine Safe Harbor-based requirements for patient de-identification. We recommend the use of Expert Determination to determine PHI for a given study and/or direct patient consent if clinical laboratories or phylodynamic practitioners desire to make these data available.","publish_time":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shean, Ryan C; Greninger, Alexander L","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1aa091c222e1c37ab245b60ed6432ab597480149.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5829646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5829646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Department of Health and Human Services","University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["patient admission dates","microbiological collection dates","sample collection dates","pathogen collection dates","specimen collection dates","discharge dates","PHI-associated dates","deposited collection date","patient identifiers","patient care","patient de-identification","direct patient consent","Department of Health","greater resolution","positive microbiological tests","emergency department","year","Infectious pathogens","protected health information","unique microbiological results","level of temporal resolution","privacy requirements","genetic information","evolution of pathogens","data available","female patients","University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department","public sharing of research data","real-time tracking of infectious transmission","routine Safe Harbor-based requirements","publication","clinical laboratories","phylodynamic practitioners desire","new mutations","rapid evolutionary rates","spread","given study","locations","Human Services guidance","days","outbreaks","metadata","outpatient testing","definitions","zip code","genome sequences","use of Expert Determination","weeks","digits","analyses","United States","ability","Samples","degree"],"language":"en"},

To improve the treatment of these patients, we aimed to identify potentially modifiable factors associated with outcome of these patients. METHODS: The PRoVENT was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study of consecutive patients under invasive mechanical ventilatory support. A predefined secondary analysis was to examine factors associated with mortality. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 935 Patients were included. In-hospital mortality was 21%. Compared to patients who died, patients who survived had a lower risk of ARDS according to the \u2018Lung Injury Prediction Score\u2019 and received lower maximum airway pressure (P(max)), driving pressure (\u0394P), positive end-expiratory pressure, and FiO(2) levels. Tidal volume size was similar between the groups. Higher P(max) was a potentially modifiable ventilatory variable associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariable analyses. \u0394P was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality, but reliable values for \u0394P were available for 343 patients only. Non-modifiable factors associated with in-hospital mortality were older age, presence of immunosuppression, higher non-pulmonary sequential organ failure assessment scores, lower pulse oximetry readings, higher heart rates, and functional dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Higher P(max) was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients under mechanical ventilatory support for reasons other than ARDS.

Through construction of a recombinant CsrA-dimer (Re-CsrA) that contains a single CesT binding site, the atomic binding features between CesT and CsrA are delineated via the structure of the CesT/Re-CsrA complex. In contrast to a previously reported N-terminally swapped dimer-form, CesT adopts a dimeric architecture with a swapped C-terminal helix for CsrA engagement. In CsrA, CesT binds to a surface patch that extensively overlaps with its mRNA binding site.

To date many subgenotypes have been reported for BVDV-1, currently ranging from subgenotype 1a to subgenotype 1u. While BVDV-1 has a world-wide distribution, the subgenotypes have a more restricted geographical distribution. As an example, BVDV-1 subgenotypes 1a and 1b are frequently detected in North America and Europe, while the subgenotype 1c is rarely detected. In contrast, BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c is by far the most commonly reported in Australia. Despite this, uneven distribution of the biological importance of the subgenotypes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to characterise the in vivo properties of five strains of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c in cattle infection studies. No overt respiratory signs were reported in any of the infected cattle regardless of strain. Consistent with other subgenotypes, transient pyrexia and leukopenia were commonly identified, while thrombocytopenia was not. The quantity of virus detected in the nasal secretions of transiently infected animals suggested the likelihood of horizontal transmission was very low.

The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential in viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for the entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. The heavily glycosylated S protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), and the receptor binding domain within S1 subunit binds with to the hACE2 receptor. Even though hACE2 has been known for two decades and has been recognized as the entry point of several human coronaviruses, no comprehensive glycosylation characterization of hACE2 has been reported. Herein, we describe the quantitative glycosylation mapping on hACE2 expressed in human cells by both glycoproteomics and glycomics. We observed heavy glycan occupancy at all the seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly, detected three novel O-glycosylation sites. In order to deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 involved with viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, presence of bisecting GlcNAc and also the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectra in addition to the use of bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation. Elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the hACE2 receptor can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and help in the development of novel therapeutics to circumvent the viral entry.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shajahan, Asif; Archer-Hartmann, Stephanie; Supekar, Nitin T.; Gleinich, Anne S.; Heiss, Christian; Azadi, Parastoo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e13b633f514991870160119e0691fdba169dae0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.071688","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hACE2 glycosylation","hACE2 receptor","viral entry","comprehensive glycosylation characterization of hACE2","S protein of SARS","site-specific glycosylation","S protein priming","glycosylated S protein","protein subunits","viral binding","entry point","possible N-glycosylation sites","novel O-glycosylation sites","quantitative glycosylation mapping","glycan spectra","glycan fucosylation","mode of viral attachment","receptor binding domain","human coronaviruses","human cells","human angiotensin","SARS-CoV","heavy glycan occupancy","binds","detailed structure of glycan epitopes","intriguing virus-receptor interactions","development of novel therapeutics","terminal orientations","S1 subunit","pattern of N","terminal sialic acid linkages","development of new therapeutic strategies","presence of bisecting GlcNAc","glycopeptide","addition","serine protease TMPRSS2","use of bioinformatics tools","trimeric spike","replication","extensive manual interpretation","pandemic","key aspect","membrane fusion","enzyme","coronavirus surface","glycoproteomics","glycomics","Emergence of COVID","interventions","order","Elucidation","decades"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A total of 32 children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 24 and February 12, 2020 from four provinces in Western China were enrolled in this study and followed up until discharge and quarantine 14 days later. Results: Eleven children (34%) were asymptomatic, among whom six children had normal computed tomographic (CT) scan images. Age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of CT scan in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The concentrations of white blood cells and neutrophils were higher in children with asymptomatic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or CT abnormalities. Patients who presented with CT abnormalities had lower D-dimer or lower total bilirubin than those who had normal CT scan but clinical symptoms. All children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 15.4 (SD=7.2) days and similar for both asymptomatic children and children with symptoms or CT abnormalities. We found a significant negative correlation between the lymphocyte count and the duration of positive nucleic acid test. Conclusions: Children with asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for the same duration as symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical significance and mechanism behind the negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 needs further study.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Enmei; Xie, Jun; Smyth, Rosalind; Zhou, Qi; Zhao, Ruiqiu; Zang, Na; Long, Xiaoru; Tang, Yuyi; Estill, Janne; Yang, Shu; Zhu, Jin; Yan, Xiaofeng; Gong, Fang; Tian, Wenguang; Zhou, Xiaqia; Mo, Yunbo; Xiao, Hongzhou; Tang, Zhengzhen; Chen, Yanni; Wang, Yi; Cui, Yuxia; Fang, Xiuling; Li, Feiyu; Tian, Yong; Li, Peibo; Deng, Quanmin; Ren, Chengsong; He, Ronghui; Li, Yi; Qin, Hong; Wang, Aiguo; Deng, Hongli; Wu, Jianguo; Meng, Wenbo; Li, Weiguo; Zhao, Yao; Luo, Zhengxiu; Wang, Zijun; Cheng, Yaolong; Wang, Gary; Li, Qiu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ba171d33eb8a3a98be5a36eee030f53cd612d3d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20073288v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["Western China"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic children","CT abnormalities","mean duration of positive SARS-CoV","clinical symptoms","asymptomatic infection","normal CT scan","results of CT scan","duration of positive nucleic acid test","clinical significance","scan images","days","study","lower total bilirubin","significant negative correlation","symptomatic patients","lower D-dimer","neutrophils","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lymphocyte count","concentrations of white blood cells","number of lymphocytes","pediatric intensive care unit","PICU","mechanism","SD","characteristic","Western China","discharge","gender","Conclusions","provinces","quarantine","Methods","Background"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study is to scale the association between anxiety and socio-demographic factors during Covid19 lockdown among the general Indian population. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive cross-sectional nationwide study was designed to enrol the general population. The inclusion criteria for this study were Indian citizens aged 15 years and above. The study was conducted from 29th March to 12th April 2020, using an online google questionnaire. The anxiety among respondents was detected and measured using a Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale which consists of 7 questions (in English), i.e. GAD-7. Findings: Respondees were 398, and from these participants, the prevalence of anxiety was 25.4 per cent. Based on the bivariate logistic regression analysis, the predictors of anxiety were gender, religion, occupation as business/self- employed, marital status, family size, health status and sleep deprivation. Conclusion: This study reports the prevalence of anxiety among Indian population who were grounded at their homes during lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic in the country. Limitations: (1) The selection of participants through non-random sampling. (2) Because of the cross-sectional character of the study, causal conclusions cannot be drawn.

Understanding clinical progression of cases is a key public health priority that informs optimal resource allocation during an emergency. Using data from Shenzhen, China, where all cases were monitored in hospital and symptom profiles and clinical and lab results were available starting from early stages of clinical course, we characterized clinical progression of COVID-19 cases and determined important predictors for faster clinical progression to key clinical events and longer use of medical resources. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, clinical, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records. We found that those who progressed to the severe stage, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) progressed on average 9.5 days (95%CI 8.7,10.3), 11.0 days (95%CI 9.7,12.3), and 10.5 days (95%CI 8.2,13.3) after symptom onset, respectively. We estimated that patients who were admitted to ICUs remained there for an average of 34.4 days (95%CI 24.1,43.2) and the average time on a ventilator was 28.5 days (95%CI 20.0,39.1) among those requiring mechanical ventilation. The median length of hospital stay was 21.3 days (95%CI, 20.5, 22.2) for the mild or moderate cases who did not progress to the severe stage, but increased to 52.1 days (95%CI, 43.3, 59.5) for those who required ICU admission.

Methods: We used internet-based strategies to enroll C3 participants beginning March 28th, 2020. Following baseline questionnaire completion, study participants will be contacted monthly (for 6 months) to complete assessments of engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., use of cloth masks, avoiding large gatherings); COVID-19 symptoms; SARS/COV2 testing and diagnosis; hospitalizations; healthcare access; and uptake of health messaging. Dried blood spot (DBS) specimens will be collected at the first follow-up assessment (last week of April 2020) and at month 3 (last week of June 2020) and stored until a validated serologic test is available. Results: As of April 20, 2020, the number of people that completed the baseline survey and provided contact information for follow-up was 7,070. Participants resided in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. At least 24% of participants were frontline workers (healthcare and other essential workers). Twenty-three percent (23%) were 60\u002B years, 24% were Black or Hispanic, 52% were men, and 52% were currently employed. Nearly 20% reported recent COVID-like symptoms (cough, fever or shortness of breath) and a high proportion reported engaging in non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduce SARS/COV2 spread (93% avoided groups \u003E20, 58% wore masks; 73% quarantined). More than half (54%) had higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness should they become infected with SARS/COV2 based on age, underlying health conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease), or daily smoking.

Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results\uFF1A267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4\u002BT cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD\u002B3 T cell counts, count of CD8\u002BT cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4\u002B T cells and CD\u002B3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03B1 and INF-\u03B3, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-\u03B1 was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Di; Yan, Xiaofeng; Tang, Xumao; Peng, Junnan; Yu, Qian; Feng, Longhua; Yuan, Guodan; Zhang, An; Chen, Yaokai; Yuan, Jing; Huang, Xia; Zhang, Xianxiang; Hu, Peng; Song, Yuyan; Qian, Chunfang; Sun, Qiangzhong; Wang, Daoxin; Tong, Jin; Xiang, Jianglin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/510ecab01c66bc2a911abcf67451ec482ed18a05.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rales"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Chongqing","China"],"keyphrases":["mortality of severe patients","non-severe patients","portion of severe patients","severe COVID","median age of patients","severe ARDS","vs","severe subgroups","high level of IL","day mortality of COVID","common symptoms of COVID","T cells","normal level of IL","Chongqing municipality","regional disparity of COVID","Hubei province","years of age","T cell counts","lower level of CD4","Chongqing provincial municipality","IQR","admission","designed hospitals of Chongqing","laboratory examinations","laboratory abnormalities","antiviral therapy","TNF-\u03B1","cases","high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy","non-invasive mechanical ventilation","systemic corticosteroid therapy","decreased CD","designated-hospitals","mainland China","normal range","Clinical outcomes","multiple-center study","prone position","count of CD8","radiological characteristics","INF-\u03B3","intensive care","total","differences","treatment regimens","retrospective","demographic","nCoV","recent travel","history of contact","novel coronavirus","real-time RT-PCR","early diagnosis","present dyspnea","pneumonia","lymphopenia","leukopenia","thrombocytopenia","respiratory failure","Traditional Chinese medicine","Methods","complications","fever","Results","dry cough","myalgia","arthralgia","Conclusion","Background","disorders","fatigue","confusion","Rales","wheezes"],"language":"en"},

Purpose: This study aimed to nowcast the COVID-19 outbreak throughout Iran and to forecast the trends of the disease spreading in the upcoming month. Methods: The cumulative incidence and fatality data were extracted from official reports of the National Ministry of Health and Medical Educations of Iran. To formulate the outbreak dynamics, six phenomenological models, as well as a modified mechanistic Susciptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, were implemented. The models were calibrated with the integrated data, and trends of the epidemic in Iran was then forecasted for the next month. Results: The final outbreak size calculated by the best fitted phenomenological models was estimated to be in the range of 68,486 to 118,923 cases; however, the calibrated SEIR model estimated that the outbreak would rage again, starting from April 26. Moreover, projected by the mechanistic model, approximately half of the infections have undergone undetected. Conclusion: Although the advanced phenomenological models perfectly fitted the data, they are incapable of applying behavioral aspects of the outbreak and hence, are not reliable enough for authorities\u0027 decision adoptions. In contrast, the mechanistic SEIR model alarms that the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran may peak for the second time, consequent to lifting the control measures. This implies that the government may implement a more granular decision making to control the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masjedi, Hamidreza; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo; Bahranizadd, Fatemeh; Zare, Mohammad Hosein","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2a071dd848a8b581c7abebd486bc45ff74596fb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20076281v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Ministry of Health and Medical Educations","SEIR"],"locations":["China","Iran"],"keyphrases":["outbreak dynamics","mechanistic model","COVID","final outbreak size","calibrated SEIR model","mechanistic SEIR model alarms","advanced phenomenological models","fatality data","integrated data","Medical Educations of Iran","disease","trends","modified mechanistic Susciptible","granular decision","control measures","upcoming month","authorities\u0027 decision adoptions","National Ministry of Health","official reports","best","cumulative incidence","half","contrast","Methods","consequent","infections","behavioral aspects","Results","cases","time","Conclusion","epidemic","SARS-COV","government","study","Wuhan","China","individuals","world","Introduction","Purpose","range"],"language":"en"},

Yet, scant research has addressed the potentially complex needs of youth on probation. This study is thus a first step in improving our ability to promote positive youth development and improved outcomes from youth on probation. It uses administrative data on probation youth from FY2011-2013 in a mid-Atlantic state. We estimated latent class models based on the ordinal scoring (high, moderate, none/low) of the 25 subscales from a standardized assessment administered at intake. In order to test whether groups were distinct, we examined a range of variables, including the official risk classification and recidivism rates measured by officieal rearrests and reconvictions. We report the demographic differences between the estimated groups, as well as adverse childhood experiences, school and employment status, previous legal history, and substance use history. Ultimately, the seven-class model produced four groups that others have noted: a relatively low needs (lowest need), relatively high needs (complex needs), substance use service needs, and mental health service needs. The other three groups that emerged include two gender specific groups (one for male and one for female high-need groups) and a group with skills needs that lacks supportive and protective skills. The analyses will facilitate a better appreciation for the service needs of moderate risk youth. Youth on probation are not a uniform population; they reflect tremendous heterogeneity, and probation systems should embrace systemic responsivity to provide appropriate services to improve youth outcomes. Advancing efforts to provide a broader spectrum of services that address multi-morbid conditions can ensure that youth have opportunities to improve their quality of life during the period of supervision.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, JoAnn; Taxman, Faye","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5565fcb0a16e4cba1b029f4a6368caf2aaf2fe24.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190740920301080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740920301080?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probation youth","complex needs of youth","high needs","low needs","youth outcomes","service needs of moderate risk youth","Abstract Youth","psychological service needs","substance use service needs","estimated groups","mental health service needs","positive youth development","probation systems","gender specific groups","substance use history","recidivism rates","appropriate services","improved outcomes","uniform population","general population","lowest need","protective skills","previous legal history","official risk classification","broader spectrum of services","latent class models","higher rates of unmet social","employment status","school","juvenile justice system","FY2011","adverse childhood experiences","ordinal scoring","multi-morbid conditions","tremendous heterogeneity","systemic responsivity","male","better appreciation","officieal","quality of life","opportunities","ability","administrative data","range of variables","standardized assessment","subscales","demographic differences","mid-Atlantic state","period of supervision","scant research","step","intake","efforts","analyses","reconvictions","order","study"],"language":"en"},

The model incorporates many of the currently important characteristics of the disease, including overcapacity in the healthcare system and uncertainties surrounding the proportion and transmission potential of asymptomatic cases. We compared current policy guidelines from public health agencies with alternative options, and investigated the effects of policy decisions on the overall proportion of COVID-19-related deaths. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak but also suggest possible refinements, including emphasizing the need to reduce public, random contacts more than private contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. Our model furthermore points to interactions among the three policy domains; the efficacy of a particular policy choice depends on other implemented policies. Finally, our results provide an explanation for why societies like Germany, with lower average rates of social contact, are more successful at containing the outbreak than highly social societies such as Italy, despite the implementation of similar policy measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCombs, Audrey; Kadelka, Claus","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f382704ea65d52b18f804dc135b684f64025368.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20073213v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["policy domains","social interactions","social societies","current policy guidelines","effects of policy decisions","effects of policy choices","particular policy choice","social distancing","testing status","low-risk symptomatic individuals","implementation of similar policy measures","risk level","low-risk members","high-risk symptomatic individuals","outbreak","current policies","results","overall proportion of COVID","lower average rates of social contact","random contacts","private contacts","infection status","implemented policies","stochastic compartmental network model of SARS","public health agencies","context","uncertainties","population","alternative options","overcapacity","Germany","need","modeled differences","hospital triaging","efficacy","transmission potential of asymptomatic cases","healthcare system","disease","Italy","important characteristics","possible refinements","explanation","related deaths"],"language":"en"},

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largely remained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In the present study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that bat-SARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The protein sequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutations in the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acid changes. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important diamino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies. Summary This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. This analysis will provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tiwari, Manish; Mishra, Divya","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34154a99ff78ed03618aca5e1b3a4aaed41261c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.043273","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel coronavirus genome","human coronavirus","synonymous mutations","non-synonymous substitutions","bat-hCoV","novel coronaviruses of different clades","different hCoV proteins","non-synonymous type","comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS","discrete mutations","bat-SARS","concomitant amino acid changes","alignment analysis","nucleotide similarity","spike protein","ORF9 protein","viral genome","Group","varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs","protein sequence similarity of pangolin","combinatorial treatment therapies","antiviral therapies","nucleotide substitution","present study","important diamino acid change RG","human infecting viruses","KR","future direction","CoV2 isolates","respect","extreme pathogenicity","reason","health care facilities","kind of mutation","explanation","maximum","genomic feature","lack of better understanding","probable ancestor","infectivity","failure","pathogenesis","vaccines","occurrence","interesting features","Detailed investigation","coding region","Summary","death tolls","patient samples","efforts","nCoV"],"language":"en"},

Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not being conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Yet these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and to thus appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to better understand the state and dynamics of the pandemic. Methods: In 100, randomly selected constituencies out of 755, 3,000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects [\u2265]14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of [\u2264]3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children \u003C14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks. Discussion: With the planned study we will establish a reliable epidemiological tool to improve the understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to better assess the effectiveness of public health measures as well as their socio-economic effects.

Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, we test the concept using the culturing supernatant contain SARS-CoV-2 particles, and its full-length sequence was used for further analysis. The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA was 93.47% with Cluster Factor about 1.1, which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. Moreover, based on the high-quality sequence, we discussed the heterozygosity and viral expression during replication of coronavirus, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM) (on 2020/03/22). We believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles.

Here we use state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 8.2 million clinical notes from 14,967 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=272) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=14,695) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify diarrhea (2.8-fold), change in appetite (2-fold), anosmia/dysgeusia (28.6-fold), and respiratory failure (2.1-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 4-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for training underlying neural networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shweta, FNU; Murugadoss, Karthik; Awasthi, Samir; Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Puranik, Arjun; Kang, Martin; Pickering, Brian W; O\u0027Horo, John C; Bauer, Philippe R; Razonable, Raymund R; Vergidis, Paschalis; Temesgen, Zelalem; Rizza, Stacey; Mahmood, Maryam; Wilson, Walter R; Challener, Douglas; Anand, Praveen; Liebers, Matt; Doctor, Zainab; Silvert, Eli; Solomon, Hugo; Wagner, Tyler; Gores, Gregory J; Williams, Amy W; Halamka, John; Soundararajan, Venky; Badley, Andrew D","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acd627554e914e5755e7d4920f36115d80c1a874.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20067660v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVIDpos patients","PCR diagnostic testing","COVIDneg patients","fold amplification","derived clinical phenotypes of COVID","typical PCR testing date","earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID","Augmented Intelligence platform","temporal dynamics of COVID","augmented curation","promising EHR","week","diarrhea","anosmia","dysgeusia","institution-wide machine intelligence platform","curation throughput","patient phenotypes","state-of-the-art deep neural networks","clinical notes","training","minimal need","early diagnosis","real-time synthesis of institutional knowledge","fine-grained resolution","Electronic Health Record","tremendous potential","days","broad spectrum of diseases","EHRs","specific combination of cough","study","respiratory failure","pathophysiology","appetite"],"language":"en"},

Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym AIFELL consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020.

In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Lauro, Francesco; Kiss, Istv\u00E1n Z; Miller, Joel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8df44a3612e85e267351e936ddeb8fc5867afa1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["intervention sustainable","China\u0027s large-scale intervention","single short-term intervention","epidemic","large peak","synchronized interventions","greatest impact","peak prevalence","total number","appreciable number of infections present","apparent early success","distinct subgroups","populations","COVID","peaks of comparable size","society","infection levels","concerns","resurgence","sub-population","rebound","policy question","intent","insight","paper","countries","place"],"language":"en"},

High quality serology is a key tool to understanding the spread of infection, immunity against the virus, and correlates of protection. Limited validation and testing of serology assays used for serosurveys can lead to unreliable or misleading data, and clinical testing using such unvalidated assays can lead to medically costly diagnostic errors and improperly informed public health decisions. Estimating prevalence and clinical decision making is highly dependent on specificity. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol from antigen production to data analysis. This protocol defines thresholds for IgG and IgM for determination of seropositivity with estimated specificity well above 99%. Validation was performed using both traditionally collected serum and dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits, using archival (pre-2019) negative controls and known PCR-diagnosed positive patient controls. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses and no cross reactivity was observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI titer during validation. This strategy is highly specific and is designed to provide good estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a population, providing specific and reliable data from serosurveys and clinical testing which can be used to better evaluate and understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and correlates of protection.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klumpp-Thomas, C.; Kalish, H.; Drew, M.; Hunsberger, S.; Snead, K.; Fay, M.

Calming the cytokine storm may be one key to save the life of patients with severe pneumonia. Here, inspired by the intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation, we have engineered platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) for pneumonia-targeted drug delivery. It is demonstrated that PEVs that are easily generated from the activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mice model with acute lung injury (ALI). By loading with [5-(p-Fluorophenyl)-2-ureido] thiophene-3-carboxamide (TPCA-1) that can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, the PEVs significantly improve therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration, and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, we find that PEVs could serve as a broad platform that can selectively target various inflammatory sites, including chronic atherosclerotic plaque, rheumatoid arthritis and wound associated with skin.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Qingle; Fan, Qin; Xu, Jialu; Bai, Jinyu; Han, Xiao; Dong, Ziliang; Zhou, Xiaozhong; Liu, Zhuang; Gu, Zhen; Wang, Chao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3c88dbf8c201937db784f9cc2263a047c2e4723.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590238520302502; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590238520302502?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEVs","severe pneumonia","Summary Pneumonia","pneumonia-targeted drug delivery","various inflammatory sites","production of inflammatory factors","local cytokine storm","pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration","uncontrolled inflammation","lung tissue","site of inflammation","activated platelets","acute lung injury","intrinsic affinity of platelets","free drug-treated group","chronic atherosclerotic plaque","rheumatoid arthritis","mice model","wound","mortality","therapeutic benefits","platelet-derived extracellular vesicles","high morbidity","life of patients","key","broad platform","ureido","thiophene","carboxamide","skin","TPCA","p-Fluorophenyl"],"language":"en"},

At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term \u0027shield immunity\u0027 at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12-15].","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weitz, Joshua S; Beckett, Stephen J; Coenen, Ashley R; Demory, David; Dominguez-Mirazo, Marian; Dushoff, Jonathan; Leung, Chung-Yin; Li, Guanlin; Magalie, Andreea; Park, Sang Woo; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Rogelio; Shivam, Shashwat; Zhao, Conan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9518d99e12fc18809c806b2296522b7c94f6b7e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049767","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["essential interactions","intervention strategies","safer interactions","interactions necessary","present model","shield immunity strategy","shield immunity approach","strategies focus","present context","recovered individuals","epidemiological intervention model","serological tests","confirmed cases","confirmed deaths","central public health control strategies","value of serological testing","functioning of essential goods","mitigation","focal points","hospital care","food supply","recognized roles","potential development of plasma","based therapies","schools","length","suppression","addition","probability of transmission","new infections","questions of sustainability","interaction substitution","pandemic","antibodies","SARS-CoV","overall burden","long-term tactics","estimating prevalence","services","population scale","objective","global crisis","outbreak","elderly","social distancing","approaches","COVID","virus"],"language":"en"},

However, it remains unclear if the disparity in mortality is due to gender differences in high-risk characteristics. Objective To study the clinical characteristics of a large and diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients stratified by gender and determine the outcomes after matching for age and other high-risk characteristics. Design Retrospective cohort between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2020 Setting TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network consisting of multiple healthcare organizations (HCOs) predominantly in the United States Participants and Exposure A cohort of male and female patients \u003E 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19 identified with real-time analyses of electronic medical records of patients from participating HCOs. A 1:1 propensity score matching of cohorts was performed for age, race, nicotine use, and all possible confounding comorbidities. Main Outcome Risk of mortality, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 Results A total of 5980 males and 7730 females diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified. Males were significantly older than females (54.9 (18.3) vs. 50.9 (18.4), p-value \u003C0.0001). There were significant differences in patient characteristics, but after propensity matching, both groups (N=5350 each group) were balanced. Males had a significantly higher risk for mortality both before (Risk Ratio (RR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) and after matching (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7). Similarly, the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4) and mechanical ventilation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) was significantly higher in males even after matching. On subanalysis, males age \u003E 50 had higher mortality than matched females of similar age (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8), whereas the risk of mortality in matched groups \u003C 40 years was similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.4-2.4). Conclusion In conclusion, males are more severely affected and have higher mortality from COVID-19. This gender-specific risk is especially more pronounced in advanced age. Gender disparity in poor outcomes can only be partially explained by differences in high-risk behavior and comorbidities. Further research is needed to understand the causes of this disparity.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, S.; Chowdhry, M.; Chatterjee, A.; Khan, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84a25a27acc6693176eebc9a3b245d1eabf7b771.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20079046v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["males age","RR","higher risk","higher mortality rates","years of age","risk of hospitalization","Importance COVID","diagnosis of COVID","Main Outcome Risk of mortality","diverse cohort of COVID","gender-specific risk","matched females of similar age","advanced age","Risk Ratio","high-risk characteristics","gender differences","propensity matching","Gender disparity","Setting TriNetX COVID","patient characteristics","clinical characteristics","propensity score matching of cohorts","female patients","cohort of male","matched groups","mechanical ventilation","significant differences","high-risk behavior","Conclusion","Design Retrospective cohort","Research Network","participating HCOs","poor outcomes","real-time analyses of electronic medical records of patients","possible confounding comorbidities","epidemiological data","Exposure","nicotine use","multiple healthcare organizations","United States Participants","days","race","total","Objective","causes","subanalysis","p-value"],"language":"en"},

A central question in the COVID-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors modulate its progression. This information is key to epidemiologists and healthcare decision-makers for improving their management plans. Previous attempts to assess the impact of climatic parameters have yielded ambiguous results, either because they were using geographically or temporally restricted data, or because they were comparing infection rates across countries, which were measured differently depending on local screening strategies. In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 dramatically increased the number of countries recording deaths, providing an opportunity to use mortality rate, which is measured more homogeneously across countries than infection rates, as a descriptor of the COVID-19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here, using data recorded in 208 territories from 88 countries, we show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature and positively affected by higher relative humidity. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~4%, while a 1% increase in relative humidity raises mortality rate by ~2%. Temperature is positively correlated with UV-index, for which one unit of increase results in a ~15% decrease in the mortality rate. We also show that other factors contribute to the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, such as the proportion of vulnerable age classes in the population, access to a non-overwhelmed health system, as well as governmental travel restrictions for controlling the spread of the disease. All of them are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of COVID-19. The influence of climatic factors is a warning to all southern hemisphere countries where winter is coming soon. Northern hemisphere countries should also be warned that climatic factors alone will likely not be sufficient to contain the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quilodran, Claudio S.; Currat, Mathias; Montoya-Burgos, Juan I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00cf7075c03c7776b8e0e523d205c76c294fcb59.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072934v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality rate of COVID","spread of COVID","number of countries","influence of climatic factors","outbreak","southern hemisphere countries","critical factors","Northern hemisphere countries","impact of climatic parameters","infection rates","disease","higher relative humidity","unit of increase results","health systems","ambiguous results","restricted data","warmer air temperature","non-overwhelmed health system","access","population","warning","challenging governments","healthcare decision-makers","epidemiologists","proportion of vulnerable age classes","global crisis","key","governmental travel restrictions","additional Celsius degree","descriptor","pandemic","opportunity","scientific community","large latitudinal range","information","deaths","winter","dynamics","management plans","Previous attempts","central question","local screening strategies","UV-index","territories","progression"],"language":"en"},

As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. Methods: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics. Findings: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%), older adults ([\u2265]55 years; 78%), Asians (81%), and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than nearly all other racial groups. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Interpretation: Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malik, A.

We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with \u0060\u0060younger\u0022 epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working non-pharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wodarz, Dominik; Komarova, Natalia L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7d9440cb3a45994c274d4de41cbaf14343c8a89.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047274","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Canada"],"keyphrases":["power law growth","exponential epidemic growth","growth dynamics","straight exponential growth","intrinsic epidemic growth law","power-law","universal growth pattern","countries epidemic development","European countries","Italy","best fitting law","COVID19 epidemic data","US","consequence of social distancing measures","social distancing behavior recommendations","epidemiological data","local geographical spread","normal course of raging infection","longer term","mixed communities","metapopulation model","absence of global mixing","rise","predictions","compliance","correlations","results","individual","Canada","alternative explanation","optimistic interpretations","need","distributed community structure","computer simulations","non-pharmaceutical interventions","epidemics","deviation","varying degrees of delay","time","UK","trajectory similar","China","air travel","period"],"language":"en"},

In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced.

Unfortunately our understanding of the therapeutic benefit of combining surgery with different treatment modalities including promising immunotherapeutics is limited by the current lack of easily adopted surgical models. The purpose of this study was to develop a surgically resectable model of PDAC in immunocompetent mice for use in preclinical investigations. Materials and Methods Surgically resectable orthotopic tumors were generated by injecting Pan02 cells into the tail of the pancreas. Fifteen days post implantation the primary tumors and tail of the pancreas were resected by laparotomy while preserving the spleen. Splenic function, tumor growth, immune phenotyping and survival were assessed following surgical resection of the primary tumor mass. Results As expected orthotopic tumor implants recapitulated many of the major histological hallmarks of PDAC including disrupted lobular structure and vascular invasion. Preservation of splenic immune cell viability and function was not associated with improved survival following surgery alone. However, pre-operative vaccination with GVAX was associated with improved survival which was not impacted by surgery. Conclusion This represents the first murine model of surgically resectable murine model of PDAC which recapitulates known pathological hallmarks of human disease in an immune competent model while allowing spleen preservation. This relatively simple and easily adopted approach provides an ideal platform to examine the efficacy of potential immunotherapy combinations for PDAC surgery patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baxter, Katherine E; de Souza, Christiano Tanese; Tai, Lee-Hwa; Yaghini, Pasha; Daneshmand, Manijeh; Bell, John C; Lichty, Brian D; Kennedy, Michael A; Auer, Rebecca C","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eae33d6b4a413f246755b871b7254df0d463827.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.990903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDAC surgery patients","resectable model of PDAC","resectable murine model of PDAC","improved survival","immune competent model","resectable orthotopic tumors","major histological hallmarks of PDAC","immune phenotyping","primary tumors","tumor growth","Splenic function","primary tumor mass","tail","majority of patients","spleen preservation","pancreas","Preservation of splenic immune cell viability","expected orthotopic tumor implants","greatest therapeutic benefit","surgical resection","surgical models","known pathological hallmarks of human disease","eligible pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","disrupted lobular structure","immunocompetent mice","efficacy of potential immunotherapy combinations","promising immunotherapeutics","different treatment modalities","use","GVAX","days post implantation","current lack","vascular invasion","preclinical investigations","Results","Pan02 cells","Materials","Methods","ideal platform","pre-operative vaccination","approach","Background","study","laparotomy","understanding","Conclusion","purpose"],"language":"en"},

It is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly. Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over SARS-CoV-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro (ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase) domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in MMR. Hence, we hypothesize that MMR could protect against poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in COVID-19, and 2) COVID-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences. We therefore propose that vaccination of at risk age groups with an MMR vaccination merits further consideration as a time-appropriate and safe intervention.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franklin, Robin; Young, Adam; Neumann, Bjoern; Fernandez, Rocio; Joannides, Alexis; Reyahi, Amir; Modis, Yorgo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2bb67cb3ce0b5c00987930f7690190f87bde572.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20053207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","MMR vaccination merits","rubella Macro domain","attenuated rubella virus","domains of SARS","rubella antibody titres","measles","fusion proteins of SARS","likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity","SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences","disease burden correlates","risk age groups","potential of childhood vaccination","poorest outcome","amino acid sequence homology","poor outcome","mumps viruses","surface-exposed conserved residues","time-appropriate","phosphatase","consideration","ADP-ribose","globe","greatest impact","worst pandemics","safe intervention","infection","recent times","initial test","hypothesis","elderly","protection"],"language":"en"},

Recent data indicate a 50% mortality rate across UK intensive care units. METHODS: A single institution, two-centre retrospective analysis following implementation of a Decision Support tool and real-time data dashboard for early detection of patients requiring personalised enhanced care, focussing particularly on respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure, oxygenation indices, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin. Protocols differing from conventional practice included high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for all COVID-19 positive patients and antioxidant prescription. RESULTS: By 22nd April 2020, 923 patients tested COVID-19 positive. 569 patients (61.7%) were male. The majority presented with advanced disease: interquartile ranges were C-reactive protein 44.9-179mg/L, D-dimer 1070-3802ng/L, and ferritin 261-1208g/L. Completed case fatality rates were 25.1% [95% CI 20.0, 30.0] in females, 40.5% [95% CI 35.9, 45.0] in males. 139 patients were admitted to intensive care where current death rates are 16.2% [95% CI 3.8, 28.7] in females, 38.2% [95% CI 28.6, 47.8] in males with no trends for differences based on ethnicity. A real-time traffic lights dashboard enabled rapid assessment of patients using critical parameters to accelerate adjustments to management protocols. In total 513 (55.6%) of patients were flagged as high risk for thromboembolic disease, exceeding the numbers flagged for respiratory deteriorations (N=391, 42.4%), or cytokine storm (N=68, 7.4%). There was minimal evidence that age was associated with disease severity, but males had higher levels of all dashboard indices, particularly C-reactive protein and ferritin (p\u003C0.0001) which displayed no relationship with age. CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates are encouraging. Protocols employed (traffic light-driven personalised care, protocolised early therapeutic anticoagulation based on D-dimer \u003E1,000ng/L and/or CRP\u003E200 mg/L, personalised ventilatory strategies and antioxidants) are recommended to other units. Males are at greater risk of severe disease, most likely as the obligate SARS-CoV-2 receptor is on the X-chromosome, and require especially close, and early attention.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vizcaychipi, M.

The presence of neutralizing antibody was determined with a modified cytopathogenic assay based on live SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. Results. The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6), and the antibody level was highest during day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly.

Due to the lack of drugs and prophylaxis against COVID-19, most of the countries are now relying on preventive measures focusing on maintaining social distance. However, this social distancing can create global socio-economic threats and psychological disorders. Therefore, these control measures need to have an assessment to evaluate their potential in containing the situation. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to control measures, health care facilities, and prevalent diseases. Based on our findings, the number of COVID-19 deaths found to reduce with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. We found 0.23, 0.16, and 0.21 as the measurement of non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians, nurses and midwives, and hospital beds and these relationships are highly significant with p-value of 0.000007, 0.0046, and 0.0196, respectively. Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between the reduction of COVID-19 cases and the earliness of preventive initiation. As a result, enhancing health care facilities as well as imposing those control measures in a short time could be valuable to prevent the currently raging COVID-19 pandemic. The apathy of taking immediate health care action from the nations has identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worst. Gambia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Namibia, and Nepal have marked in a state of danger based on the comparative study towards the health care action for the top twenty burdening and least affected countries. Interestingly, no association in most diseases except for few cases has found between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19, which warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level. We believe that this study could provide a guide for future COVID-19 research.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdulla, F.; Nain, Z.; Karimuzzaman, M.; Hossain, M. M.; Adhikari, U.

However, several critical hurdles have impeded the development of robust AI model, which include deficiency, isolation, and heterogeneity of CT data generated from diverse institutions. These bring about lack of generalization of AI model and therefore prevent it from applications in clinical practices. To overcome this, we proposed a federated learning-based Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI), a decentralized architecture where the AI model is distributed to and executed at each host institution with the data sources or client ends for training and inferencing without sharing individual patient data. Specifically, we firstly developed an initial AI CT model based on data collected from three Tongji hospitals in Wuhan. After model evaluation, we found that the initial model can identify COVID from Tongji CT test data at near radiologist-level (97.5% sensitivity) but performed worse when it was tested on COVID cases from Wuhan Union Hospital (72% sensitivity), indicating a lack of model generalization. Next, we used the publicly available UCADI framework to build a federated model which integrated COVID CT cases from the Tongji hospitals and Wuhan Union hospital (WU) without transferring the WU data. The federated model not only performed similarly on Tongji test data but improved the detection sensitivity (98%) on WU test cases. The UCADI framework will allow participants worldwide to use and contribute to the model, to deliver a real-world, globally built and validated clinic CT-COVID AI tool. This effort directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\u0027 number 3, Good Health and Well-Being, and allows sharing and transferring of knowledge to fight this devastating disease around the world.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Y.; Ma, L.; Fan, Y.; Chen, Y.; Ma, K.; Yang, J.; Yang, X.; Shu, C.; Fan, Z.; Gan, J.; Zou, X.; Huang, R.; Zhang, C.; Liu, X.; Tu, D.; Xu, C.; Zhang, W.; Yang, D.; Wang, M.-W.; Wang, X.; Xie, X.; Leng, H.; Holalkere, N.; Halin, N.

We didn\u0027t find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (\u003E60 vs \u003C60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker\u0027s lung compared to non-smoker\u0027s lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Guoshuai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59eab95c43fdea01481fdbf9bae45dfe28ffc693.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher ACE2 gene expression","Caucasian current smokers","susceptible groups","existence of gene","goblet cells of current smokers","gender groups","age groups","smoking history","racial groups","smoking status","smoking interaction","nCov outbreak","SARS-nCov","Asian vs Caucasian","club cells of non-smokers","single-cell transcriptomic datasets","susceptible population","specific cell types","non-smoker\u0027s lung","study","male vs female","remodelled AT2 cells","current severe global emergency situation","large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue","significant disparities","valuable information","effective protection","distribution","standardizing treatment regimen","infection paths different","care","race","location","receptor","bronchial epithelium","addition","studies","alveoli"],"language":"en"},

Methods 231 nurse practitioners were enrolled who worked in isolation region in designated hospitals to admit patients with COVID-19 in China. Demographic data, goggle-associated symptoms and underlying reasons, incidence of medical errors or exposures, the effects of fog in goggles on practice were all collected. Data were stratified and analyzed by age or working experience. Risk factors of goggle-associated medical errors were analyzed by multivariable logistical regression analysis. Findings Goggle-associated symptoms and foggy goggles widely presented in nurses. The most common symptoms were headache, skin pressure injury and dizziness. Headache, vomit and nausea were significantly fewer reported in nurses with longer working experience while rash occurred higher in this group. The underlying reasons included tightness of goggles, unsuitable design and uncomfortable materials. The working status of nurses with more working experience was less impacted by goggles. 11.3% nurses occurred medical exposures in clinical practice while 19.5% nurses made medical errors on patients. The risk factors for medical errors were time interval before adapting to goggle-associated discomforts, adjusting goggles and headache. Interpretation Goggle-associated symptoms and fog can highly impact the working status and contribute to medical errors during management of COVID-19. Increased the experience with working in PPE through adequate training and psychological education may benefit for relieving some symptoms and improving working status. Improvement of goggle design during productive process was strongly suggested to reduce incidence of discomforts and medical errors.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, X.-h.; Feng, Y.-r.; Li, G.-m.; Pang, X.-j.; Chen, T.; Zhou, Y.-l.; Zhang, H.; Lang, J.; Li, L.-m.; Feng, L.; He, X.; Zheng, W.; Miao, H.; Wang, Y.-h.; Kang, X.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adeaaa8cf4aa51586721b4ac4e4c8547030b395c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20094854v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["working experience","incidence of medical errors","working status of nurses","medical exposures","Findings Goggle-associated symptoms","Interpretation Goggle-associated symptoms","impact of goggles","foggy goggles","tightness of goggles","associated discomforts","Risk factors of goggle","common symptoms","Improvement of goggle design","headache","clinical practice","management of patients","management of COVID","underlying reasons","incidence of discomforts","effects of fog","unsuitable design","Demographic data","PPE","skin pressure injury","adequate training","designated hospitals","health","time interval","psychological education","productive process","multivariable logistical regression analysis","isolation region","dizziness","uncomfortable materials","nausea","vomit","fewer","rash","nurse practitioners","Methods","China","Background","group"],"language":"en"},

A multitude of research efforts worldwide aim at characterizing the cellular factors involved in viral transmission in order to reveal therapeutic targets. For a full understanding of the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its expression has been reported in various human organs, in some cases with inconsistent or contradictory results. Here, we aim to verify a reliable expression profile of ACE2 in all major human tissues and cell types. Based on stringently validated immunohistochemical analysis and high-throughput mRNA sequencing from several datasets, we found that ACE2 expression is mainly localized to microvilli of the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules, gallbladder epithelium, testicular Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, glandular cells of seminal vesicle and cardiomyocytes. The expression in several other previously reported locations, including alveolar type II (AT2) cells, could not be confirmed. Furthermore, ACE2 expression was absent in the AT2 lung carcinoma cell line A549, often used as a model for viral replication studies. Our analysis suggests that the expression of ACE2 in the human respiratory system appears to be limited, and the expression of the receptor in lung or respiratory epithelia on the protein level is yet to be confirmed. This raises questions regarding the role of ACE2 for infection of human lungs and highlights the need to further explore the route of transmission during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hikmet, Feria; M\u00E9ar, Loren; Uhl\u00E9n, Mathias; Lindskog, Cecilia","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37b5fb89f1e678d0617556355b04952a82b51430.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.016048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression","expression of ACE2","cell type-specific expression","reliable expression profile of ACE2","SARS-CoV","role of ACE2","cell types","host cell entry","infection of human lungs","Leydig cells","host cell surface receptor","human respiratory system","testicular Sertoli cells","major human tissues","AT2 lung carcinoma cell line A549","pathogenic SARS-coronavirus","various human organs","viral transmission","glandular cells of seminal vesicle","alveolar type","respiratory epithelia","route of transmission","protein level","reported locations","key protein","validated immunohistochemical analysis","viral replication studies","gallbladder epithelium","renal proximal tubules","high-throughput mRNA sequencing","cases","intestinal tract","novel","order","microvilli","datasets","Angiotensin","model","cellular factors","cardiomyocytes","enzyme","global challenge","international spread","therapeutic targets","healthcare","society","contradictory results","need","susceptibility","multitude of research efforts","understanding","questions"],"language":"en"},

The effectiveness of tFUS on human brain has been demonstrated, but how tFUS influences the human voluntary motor processing in the brain remains unclear. We apply low-intensity tFUS to modulate the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) originating from human subjects practicing a voluntary foot tapping task. 64-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) is recorded concurrently and further used to reconstruct the brain source activity specifically at the primary leg motor cortical area using the electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). The ESI illustrates the ultrasound modulated MRCP source dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The MRCP source is imaged and its source profile is further evaluated for assessing the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on the voluntary MRCP. Moreover, the effect of ultrasound pulse repetition frequency (UPRF) is further assessed in modulating the MRCP. ESI results show that tFUS significantly increases the MRCP source profile amplitude (MSPA) comparing to a sham ultrasound condition, and further, a high UPRF enhances the MSPA more than a low UPRF.

The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a \u0022stay at home\u0022 order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. Methods: We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020, on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. Findings: We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures on 7th May can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Conclusions: Our work supports the decision to apply stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. We provide strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keeling, M.

As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (\u003E0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (\u003E10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (\u003E75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Ling; Chen, Shaoqiu; Fu, Yuanyuan; Gao, Zitong; Long, Hui; Ren, Hong-wei; Zuo, Yi; Li, Huan; Wang, Jie; Xv, Qing-bang; Yu, Wen-xiong; Liu, Jia; Shao, Chen; Hao, Jun-jie; Wang, Chuan-zhen; Ma, Yao; Wang, Zhanwei; Yanagihara, Richard; Wang, Jian-ming; Deng, Youping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3132546632d775e7e7988f3edeae293e540f5f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20037721","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["clinical outcomes of COVID","unfavorable clinical outcomes","poor clinical outcomes","clinical progression","clinical decision","favorable outcomes","patient outcomes","initial clinical presentation","disease progression","novel risk factors","coronavirus disease","critical disease status","disease severity groups","hospitalized patients","use of hypnotics","Logistic regression models","multivariate regression","study","univariate logistic regression model","high hypersensitive troponin","higher hypersensitive troponin","useful data","Survival analysis","better survival","Current standard treatments","diabetes","smoking","significant improvement","years","retrospective chart review","countries","mortality","effective ancillary treatment","age","association","logrank test","evidence of sustained transmission","Background","Methods","indication","pg","response","knowledge","contrast","Wuhan","global pandemic","Conclusions","leukocytosis","neutrophilia"],"language":"en"},

In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. This disruption to daily life may have consequences for eating and physical activity patterns. Methods: In this observational study, we examined the effect of isolation measures, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April), on diet (24-hour diet recall, ASA-24) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns among third-year biomedical students in Brisbane, Australia. Findings were compared to students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years. Results: In females, energy intake was ~20% greater in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019, and the frequency of snacking and energy density of consumed snacks were also increased. In males, there was no difference in energy intake or snacking behaviour. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes, whereby fewer students undertook any walking activity and, of those that did, time spent doing so was less compared with 2018 and 2019. The proportion of students reporting any vigorous activity was not different for males or females but, among males who participated in this level of activity, the duration was less in 2020 compared with previous years. The proportion of male and female students achieving sufficient levels of activity, defined by at least 150 mins over at least 5 sessions, was ~30% less in 2020. Indeed, the majority of students reported as having undertaken less physical activity than usual. Conclusions: Increased energy intake for females and reduced physical activity for males and females demonstrate impacts of isolation measures that may have deleterious consequences for physical and mental wellbeing, with the potential to affect long-term nutrition and activity patterns.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallo, L.

However, the predictive effects of those indicators on disease classification and prognosis remains largely unknown. We dynamically measured those reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types. Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise classification and prognosis prediction are critical for saving the insufficient medical resources, stratified treatment and improving the survival rate of critically ill patients. We recommend that LYM% be used independently or in combination with other indicators in the management of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Li; Kang, Xia; Ji, Xinran; Wang, Qi; li, Yongsheng; Wang, Qiongshu; Miao, Hongming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e096b2ffdf2d39fa0e28a263bc20a3323bcb5f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053769","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CRP","disease classification","ill patients","guide classification of COVID","prognosis prediction","predicting prognosis","cases of COVID","management of COVID","precise classification","reported indicators","moderate types","Risk indicators viral load","lactic acid","PCT","investigated factors","ORF1ab Ct","stratified treatment","insufficient medical resources","lymphocyte percentage","survival rate","C-reactive protein","interleukin","procalcitonin","reliable predictor","pandemic","predictive effects","different degrees","recent studies","combination","data"],"language":"en"},

In some cases, residents have been asked to stay home at least till they are instructed otherwise. This unfortunate event presents an innovative opportunity for neurosurgical education in Africa. Herein, we detail the framework of an online neurosurgical education initiative to advance the education of African residents and young Neurosurgeons during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanmounye, Ulrick Sidney; Esene, Ignatius N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/914b67804ea19977cfeff4da87b2609d376d9f30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020310974; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020310974?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["Neurosurgical trainees","education of African residents","online neurosurgical education initiative","young neurosurgeons","current COVID","pandemic","advent of covid","resilient neurosurgical educational systems","fabric of African Neurosurgery","innovative opportunity","multiple programs","physical distancing","continent","knees","history","framework","unfortunate event","new reality","order","impact","brunt","person interactions","face","cases"],"language":"en"},

We aim to decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Design: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated. Results: Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced IFN{gamma}, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, H.; Liu, W.; Liu, D.; Zhao, L.; Yu, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21472b4330e32d3941eecf8187d80a8b0d19fcd6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20096024v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung epithelial cells of COVID","lung of COVID","SARS-CoV","interplay of immune cells","NK cells of severe patients","target cells","community interplay of lung epithelial cells","lung T","expression of SARS","mild patients","immune cells infiltration patterns","severe COVID","infection","healthy controls","receptor of SARS","club cell","ciliated cell","basal cell","data of lung samples","dysregulation of immune response","infected cell types","different cell types","consequent host immune response","pro-inflammatory cytokines","single-cell RNA sequencing","Perforin expression","lower T","gene expression profiles","overall ACE2","interaction","higher neutrophil","increased cytokines","Granulysin","scRNA-seq","macrophage","CCL7","gamma","CCL2","Granzyme B","CCL3L1","CCL4L2","enhanced IFN","subjects","Comparative transcriptome analysis","interferon pathway","outbreak of Coronavirus disease","TMPRSS2","receptors","Objective","global health emergency","neutrophils","cytotoxic phenotypes","Design","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The disease is sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March. As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country. Here, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R0); (d) the \u0022effective\u0022 per-day disease transmission; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death, the case fatality ratio, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the \u0060\u0060effective\u0022 per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. Furthermore, based on an estimation for the reduction in the \u0022effective\u0022 transmission rate of the disease as of March 8 that reflects the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we ran the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, the effect of social distancing, and the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results. Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the DAY-ZERO was most likely between January 5 and January 23 with the most probable date the 15th of January 2020. The actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. The \u0022effective\u0022 per-day disease transmission rate for the period until March 8 was found to be 0.686 (95% CI:0.660, 0.713), while the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.51 (95% CI: 4.14, 4.90). Importantly, simulations show that the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy is expected to fade out by the end of May - early June, 2020, if the draconian, as of March 20 and March 21, measures are maintained.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russo, Lucia; Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Tsakris, Athanassios; Bifulco, Gennaro Nicola; Campana, Emilio Fortunato; Toraldo, Gerardo; Siettos, Constantinos","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50f497f7ea95a82ec18292968d175893402a0f68.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports","Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports","Google"],"locations":["China","Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["lockdown day of Lombardy","total cases","day disease transmission rate","day transmission rate","actual number of exposed","number of actual exposed","actual cumulative number of exposed cases","confirmed cases","confirmed cumulative number of infected cases","total population","Italy","basic reproduction number R0","Google COVID","outbreak","estimation","fade","numbers of new daily cases","draconian measures","Community Mobility Reports","novel coronavirus disease","modelling","pandemic","SEIRD simulator","reduction","isolation measures","forecast","compartments of infectious persons","clinical data","recovery period","clinical studies","surpassed China\u0027s death toll","effect of social distancing","case fatality ratio","times","mixed-integer optimization problem","onset of symptoms","aid of genetic algorithms","exposure","epicenter","order","individual","Dead","basis","uncertainty","proposed methodological procedure","suspension","activities","government","computed values","entire country","probable date","end","parameters","purpose","epidemic","simulations","estimates","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care. Methods and Findings: Retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five hospitals in New York City with index hospitalization between February 27th-April 12th, 2020, with follow-up of [\u2265]14 days. Significance was defined as P\u003C0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. Of 2,864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared to patients who did not return, among those who returned there was a higher proportion of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%). Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs. 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; Padjusted=0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; Padjusted=0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, Padjusted=0.064).

Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Somani, S.; Richter, F.; Fuster, V.; De Freitas, J.; Naik, N.; Sigel, K.; Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center,; Boettinger, E.

Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, with immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 leading to a hyperinflammatory response. A comprehensive understanding of the inflammatory process in COVID-19 is lacking. Methods In this prospective, multicenter observational study, patients with PCR-proven or clinically presumed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or clinical wards were included. Demographic and clinical data were obtained and plasma was serially collected. Concentrations of IL-6, TNF-, complement components C3a, C3c and the terminal complement complex (TCC) were determined in plasma by ELISA. Additionally, 269 circulating biomarkers were assessed using targeted proteomics. Results were compared between ICU and non ICU patients. Findings A total of 119 (38 ICU and 91 non ICU) patients were included. IL-6 plasma concentrations were elevated in COVID-19 (ICU vs. non ICU, median 174.5 pg/ml [IQR 94.5-376.3 vs. 40.0 pg/ml [16.5-81.0]), whereas TNF- concentrations were relatively low and not different between ICU and non ICU patients (median 24.0 pg/ml [IQR 16.5-33.5] and 21.5 pg/ml [IQR 16.0-33.5], respectively). C3a and terminal complement complex (TCC) concentrations were significantly higher in ICU vs. non ICU patients (median 556.0 ng/ml [IQR 333.3-712.5]) vs. 266.5 ng/ml [IQR 191.5-384.0 for C3a and 4506 mAU/ml [IQR 3661-6595 vs. 3582 mAU/ml [IQR 2947-4300] for TCC) on the first day of blood sampling. Targeted proteomics demonstrated that IL-6 (logFC 2.2), several chemokines and hepatocyte growth factor (logFC 1.4) were significantly upregulated in ICU vs. non ICU patients. In contrast, stem cell factor was significantly downregulated (logFC -1.3) in ICU vs. non ICU patients, as were DPP4 (logFC -0.4) and protein C inhibitor (log FC -1.0), the latter two factors also being involved in the regulation of the kinin-kallikrein pathway. Unsupervised clustering pointed towards a homogeneous pathogenetic mechanism in the majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, with patient clustering mainly based on disease severity. Interpretation We identified important pathways involved in dysregulation of inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19, including the IL-6, complement system and kinin-kallikrein pathways. Our findings may aid the development of new approaches to host-directed therapy.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"van de Veerdonk, F. L.; Janssen, N. A.

High income countries (HIC) seemingly account for the majority of the mortalities considering that these countries have screened more persons. Low middle income countries (LMIC) countries may experience far worse mortalities considering the existence of a weaker health care system and the several underlying population level morbidities. As a result, it becomes imperative to understand the ecological correlation between critical underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Method: This is an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases, prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, adult HIV prevalence, quality of air and life expectancy. We plotted a histogram, performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and used spearman correlation to assess the degree of correlation between COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and other covariates mentioned above. Result: As at the 31st of March 2020, there were a total of 846,281 cases of COVID-19 from 204 countries and a global case fatality rate of 5% (range 0% to 29%). Angola and Sudan both had the highest CFR of 29%, while Italy had the highest number of deaths (i.e. 12,428) as at 31st of March 2020. Adult HIV prevalence has a significant but weak negative correlation with CFR (correlation coefficient = - 0.24, p value =0.01) while all the other variables have positive correlation with CFR due to COVID-19 though not statistically significant. Of the 204 countries analyzed, only 11 countries (i.e. 5%) had complete datasets across all 5 population level morbidities (i.e. prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy, quality of air, and adult HIV prevalence variables). Correlations of CFR from these 11 countries were similar to that from the 204 countries except for the correlation with quality of air and prevalence of tobacco use. Conclusion: While we interpret our data with caution given the fact that this is an ecological study, our findings suggest that population level factors such as prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy and quality of air are positively correlated with CFR from COVID-19 but, adult HIV prevalence has a weak and negative correlation with COVID-19 CFR and would require extensive research.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"OKPOKORO, E.; IGBINOMWANHIA, V.; JEDY-AGBA, E.; KAYODE, G.; ONYEMATA, E.; ABIMIKU, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0964e1a2cd23aa73d6540e5d461214b53c0da86c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20082370v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["Angola","Sudan"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of COPD","prevalence of tobacco use","ecological correlation","adult HIV prevalence variables","cases of COVID","highest CFR","correlation coefficient","spearman correlation","degree of correlation","positive correlation","Correlations of CFR","weak negative correlation","quality of air","High income countries","Low middle income countries","population level factors","life expectancy","critical underlying population level morbidities","ecological study","case fatality rates","global case fatality rate","result","worse mortalities","highest number of deaths","existence","LMIC","weaker health care system","Shapiro-Wilk normality test","findings","ongoing Coronavirus disease","Italy","complete datasets","Background","pandemic","Sudan","p value","scope","histogram","Angola","caution","Method","range","extensive research","total","covariates","majority","Conclusion","persons"],"language":"en"},

Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.8M to 3.6M using only 672k more tests. This strategy is well-suited to supplement testing for asymptomatic and mild cases who would otherwise go untested, and enable them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sinnott-Armstrong, Nasa; Klein, Daniel; Hickey, Brendan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b1a7bff6f306279024a8dac3e2c3c7f4dafc47a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043968","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["testing kit","testing of asymptomatic","Current testing strategies","randomized group testing","pooled testing strategy","prevalence","current COVID","well-studied group testing literature","individual tests of cases","mild cases","spread of COVID","current SARS-CoV","total number of tests","number of tested individuals","fold","RNA extraction kit availability","limited test kit supply","low-risk individuals","test costs","practical changes","behavioral changes","major limiting factor","modeling","restrictive diagnostic criteria","pandemic","protocols","country","pooling","patient disease status","effective way"],"language":"en"},

To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance. It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC. We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences. Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed. Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37\u2103 should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease. Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Guojun; Han, Yijiao; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Shen, Jifang; Li, Tong; Pu, Qibing; Chen, Aijun; Qi, Zhiyang; Sun, Lijun; Cai, Hongliu","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Several methods are currently being evaluated such as protease and glycosylated spike (S) protein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among coronavirus and host cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the glycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the most encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs.The novelty of the proposed approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural network toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two different viruses family such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep learning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019-nCoV protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on public datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for 2019-nCoV.

One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario 1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\\% effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the transmission rate $\\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\\%, In this scenario active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission rate $\\beta$ was reduced to 70\\% of its initial value, in which the number of cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\\beta$ was reduced to 80\\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about ~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teles, Pedro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6990b0b3128645b57d3f4954730a20ce1510740.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10047v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Portugal","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["control scenario","scenario active cases","number of cases","number of active cases","number of affected people","curve of active cases","beta","importance of control","evolution of covid","South Korean model","transmission rate","different scenarios","government measures","appropriate measures","study","Portugal","peak","spread","adapted SIR model","new coronavirus covid","World Health Organization","health authorities","self-protecting measure","Portuguese situation","recommendations","questions","policy makers","governments","Italian dara","MERS outbreak","rest","initial value","effectiveness","state of pandemic","time","level"],"language":"en"},

In this model, the infection transmission rate of a given node in the epidemic layer depends upon its awareness probability in the awareness layer. Similarly, the infection information transmission rate of a node in the awareness layer depends upon its infection probability in the epidemic layer. The spread of disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms of SIS (Susceptible Infected Susceptible) process over the epidemic layer and the spread of information about the disease outbreak is described in terms of UAU (Unaware Aware Unaware) process over the virtual interaction mediated awareness layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and the resulting co-evolution of these mutually competing processes is studied in terms of a network topology depend parameter({\\alpha}). Using a second order linear theory it has been shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these processes can be described in terms of damped and driven harmonic oscillator equations. From the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that for the suitable choice of parameter({\\alpha}), the two process can either exhibit sustained oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to the endemic state. Further, for the case of endemic state it is shown that the inclusion of awareness layer significantly lowers the disease transmission rate and reduces the size of epidemic. The endemic state infection probability of a given node corresponding to the damped dynamics is found to have dependence upon both the transmission rates as well as on both absolute intra-layer and relative inter-layer degree of the individual nodes.","publish_time":"2018-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sagar, Vikram; Zhao, Yi; Sen, Abhijit","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb7dbdc437525a13abf722f19a268c140c58ec6a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08947v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS (Susceptible Infected Susceptible","UAU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic layer","inclusion of awareness layer","awareness probability","infection transmission rate","terms of damped","disease transmission rate","corresponding awareness","infection information transmission rate","absolute intra-layer","damped dynamics","endemic state infection probability","relative inter-layer degree","effect of time variation of transmission rates","resulting co-evolution","given node","terms of UAU","terms of SIS","spread of disease","size of epidemic","co-evolution of epidemics","case of endemic state","disease outbreak","spread of information","processes","alpha","continuous time limit","network topology","non-linear stochastic model","layered multiplex network","suitable choice of parameter","virtual interaction","driven harmonic oscillator equations","individual nodes","physical contacts","present work","exhibit","dependence","results","Monte-Carlo simulation","order linear theory"],"language":"en"},

Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwab, Patrick; Schutte, August DuMont; Dietz, Benedikt; Bauer, Stefan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eed2b953b4f2fa64c2779b98f6e7b8cb92278de.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08302v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive SARS-CoV","clinical predictive models","positive patients","clinical data","terms of SARS","clinical features","clinical pathways","human transmission of SARS","Predictive algorithms","predictive performance","aforementioned clinical tasks","critical care","healthcare systems","intensive care unit","Coronavirus Disease","ICU","hospitalisation","healthcare capacities","AUC","COVID","blood analysis data","emerging respiratory disease","rapid human","experimental results","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","beds","tests","retrospective evaluation","degree","cohort","risk","strain","mechanical ventilators","machine learning","addition","resources","sensitivity","specificity"],"language":"en"},

During the second quadratic growth phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation much earlier than the others.

In an effort to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been introduced with success.

Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports.

However, existing location privacy models are either not rigorous or not customizable, which limits the trade-off between privacy and utility in many real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new location privacy notion called PGLP, i.e., \\textit{Policy Graph based Location Privacy}, providing a rich interface to release private locations with customizable and rigorous privacy guarantee. First, we design the privacy metrics of PGLP by extending differential privacy. Specifically, we formalize a user\u0027s location privacy requirements using a \\textit{location policy graph}, which is expressive and customizable. Second, we investigate how to satisfy an arbitrarily given location policy graph under adversarial knowledge. We find that a location policy graph may not always be viable and may suffer \\textit{location exposure} when the attacker knows the user\u0027s mobility pattern. We propose efficient methods to detect location exposure and repair the policy graph with optimal utility. Third, we design a private location trace release framework that pipelines the detection of location exposure, policy graph repair, and private trajectory release with customizable and rigorous location privacy. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the privacy-utility trade-off and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Yang; Xiao, Yonghui; Takagi, Shun; Xiong, Li; Yoshikawa, Masatoshi; Shen, Yilin; Liu, Jinfei; Jin, Hongxia; Xu, Xiaofeng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01263v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rigorous location privacy","location policy graph","user\u0027s location privacy requirements","new location privacy notion","existing location privacy models","differential privacy","detection of location exposure","privacy-utility trade-off","rigorous privacy guarantee","policy graph repair","privacy metrics of PGLP","private location trace release framework","textit","private trajectory release","private locations","optimal utility","real-world datasets","real-world applications","user\u0027s mobility pattern","efficiency","attacker","effectiveness","rich interface","adversarial knowledge","efficient methods","proposed algorithms","experiments","issue","literature"],"language":"en"},

Standard models, e.g., the SIR model, have stressed on the importance of finding the susceptible cases to flatten the growth rate of the spread of infection as early as possible. In the present scientific world, location traces in the form of GPS coordinates are logged by mobile device manufacturing and their operating systems developing companies, such as Apple, Samsung, Google etc. However, due to the sensitive nature of this data, it is usually not shared with other organisations, mainly to protect individual privacy. However, in disaster situations, such as epidemics, data in the form of location traces of a community of people can potentially be helpful to proactively locate susceptible people from the community and enforce quarantine on them as early as possible. Since procuring such data for the purpose of restricted use is difficult (time-consuming) due to the sensitive nature of the data, a strong case needs to be made that how could such data be useful in disaster situations. The aim of this article is to to demonstrate a proof-of-the-concept that with the availability of massive amounts of real check-in data, it is feasible to develop a scalable system that is both effective (in terms of identifying the susceptible people) and efficient (in terms of the time taken to do so). We believe that this proof-of-the-concept will encourage sharing (with restricted use) of such sensitive data in order to help mitigate disaster situations. In this article, we describe a software resource to efficiently (consuming a small run-time) locate a set of susceptible persons given a global database of user check-ins and a set of infected people. Specifically, we describe a system, named InfecTracer, that seeks to find out cases of close proximity of a person with another infected person.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biswas, Chandan; Ganguly, Debasis","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fc31624e5351b891085588733a2d01d4581a7ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08851v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Apple","Samsung","Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitive data","susceptible people","community of people","susceptible cases","disaster situations","set of infected people","sensitive nature","set of susceptible persons","form of location traces","availability of massive amounts of real check-in data","infected person","concept","terms","Epidemics","article","proof","purpose of restricted use","growth rate","present Covid","rapid rate","spread of infection","scalable system","form of GPS coordinates","present scientific world","cases of close proximity","mobile device manufacturing","global database of user check-ins","operating systems","companies","Apple","order","SIR model","Samsung","pandemic","small run-time","importance","sharing","quarantine","Standard models","software resource","strong case","organisations","individual privacy","Google","InfecTracer","aim"],"language":"en"},

Simply by changing the input parameters, a large question bank with solutions even to complex physical problems can be generated. Thus, it is a powerful alternative to the calculated and multiple choice questions which can be written directly in the Moodle platform. The module writes the questions to be imported into Moodle in a simple and human-readable ASCII output using the GIFT format, which enables html definitions for URLs for importing figures, or for simple text formatting (sub/superindices or Greek letters) for equations and units.

Handling large numbers of small multiples imposes challenges on many analytic tasks like inspection, comparison, navigation, or annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a framework and implemented a library called Piling.js for designing interactive piling interfaces. Based on the piling metaphor, such interfaces afford flexible organization, exploration, and comparison of large numbers of small multiples by interactively aggregating visual objects into piles. Based on a systematic analysis of previous work, we present a structured design space to guide the design of visual piling interfaces. To enable designers to efficiently build their own visual piling interfaces, Piling.js provides a declarative interface to avoid having to write low-level code and implements common aspects of the design space. An accompanying GUI additionally supports the dynamic configuration of the piling interface. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Piling.js with examples from machine learning, immunofluorescence microscopy, genomics, and public health.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lekschas, Fritz; Zhou, Xinyi; Chen, Wei; Gehlenborg, Nils; Bach, Benjamin; Pfister, Hanspeter","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00595v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GUI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["design of visual piling interfaces","interactive piling interfaces","piling metaphor","visual objects","comparison of large numbers of small multiples","structured design space","challenges","miniature representations of visual information","declarative interface","immunofluorescence microscopy","genomics","analytic tasks","exploration","machine learning","flexible organization","examples","inspection","common aspects","dynamic configuration","navigation","systematic analysis of previous work","public health","low-level code","accompanying GUI","library","expressiveness of","framework","annotation","piles","domains","designers"],"language":"en"},

This requires raising awareness and sensitization with the correct information in order to prevent and contain outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, there is a fine balance between continuous awareness-raising by providing new information and the risk of misinformation. In this work, we address this gap by creating a life-long learning application that delivers authentic information to users in Hindi and English, the most widely used languages in India. It does this by matching sources of verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports against daily news by using machine learning and natural language processing. It delivers the narrated content in Hindi by using state-of-the-art text to speech engines. Finally, the approach allows user input for continuous improvement of news feed relevance daily. We demonstrate this approach for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene information for containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirteen combinations of pre-processing strategies, word-embeddings, and similarity metrics were evaluated by eight human users via calculation of agreement statistics.

Political trolls face unique challenges as they must build their own communities while simultaneously disrupting others.

We performed a quantitative longitudinal analysis of more than 16 million comments from one of the most popular and disruptive political trolling communities, the subreddit /r/The\\_Donald (T\\D). We use T_D as a lens to understand participation and collective action within these deviant spaces. In specific, we first study the characteristics of the most active participants to uncover what might drive their sustained participation. Next, we investigate how these active individuals mobilize their community to action. Through our analysis, we uncover that the most active employed distinct discursive strategies to mobilize participation, and deployed technical tools like bots to create a shared identity and sustain engagement.

The effects of drag, diffusion and the gravity on the droplets during its motion in the air have been taken into account. We found that the distance traveled by a droplet released at an average human height by an infected individual strongly depends on the velocity of ejection and mass of the droplet. For example, a droplet of radius 100 $\\mu$m and mass 4186 nano-gm released at a height of 1.7 meter will travel 2.35 meter distance horizontally before settling gravitationally. The same droplet with lower ejection velocity of 5 m/s will travel a horizontal distance of 0.55 meter approximately. We found that the gravitational force does not allow larger (and hence massive) droplets to remain suspended in the air for long. Because the gravitational force is superior to the the drag force exerted by the air molecules on larger droplets. However, for smaller droplets the drag force dominates over the gravitational force which allows it to be suspended in the air for longer time. As an instance a droplet of radius 2.5 $\\mu$m may remain suspended in the air for more than half an hour. This suggests that a healthy individual should maintain temporal distance from an infected one to avoid virus suspended in the air. Therefore, as preventive strategies a healthy individual should not only maintain geometric distance from an infected one but also temporal distance to deter the floating smaller droplets by covering nose, mouth, etc. This approach will be useful for the prevention of current COVID19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Santosh K.; Alam, Jan-e; Plumari, Salvatore; Greco, Vincenzo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20a9f2d1c437f46eb7a574064efe228fd36bbb0f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12375v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["meter distance","larger droplets","drag force","motion of droplets","temporal distance","gravitational force","air molecules","geometric distance","droplet of radius","horizontal distance","infected individual","floating smaller droplets","healthy individual","velocity of ejection","mu","mass","lower ejection velocity","average human height","nose","scope of Langevin stochastic differential equation","prevention of current COVID19 pandemic","approach","mouth","nano-gm","diffusion","preventive strategies","gravity","sneezing","speaking","longer time","example","instance","virus","effects","account","hour"],"language":"en"},

The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated using a simulation over a network of cities in the northeastern United States.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Dan; Liu, Ji; Par\u0027e, Philip E.; Chen, Wei; Qiu, Li; Beck, Carolyn L.; Bacsar, Tamer","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a13801c5ae0bb67e57222d2f428db72a046ce2be.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11065v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["values of curing","single input","minimum curing budget","healthy state","control input","network of cities","network structure","single agent","explicit expression","networked SIS model","infection rates","problem","analysis of signed Laplacians","sufficient condition","northeastern United States","connected undirected graph","simulation","case","algorithm","utility","paper"],"language":"en"},

There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown (Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service. In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the epidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossa, Fabio Della; Salzano, Davide; Meglio, Anna Di; Lellis, Francesco De; Coraggio, Marco; Calabrese, Carmela; Guarino, Agostino; Cardona, Ricardo; DeLellis, Pietro; Liuzza, Davide; Iudice, Francesco Lo; Russo, Giovanni; Bernardo, Mario di","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34d802f246e31c660bf5a442ddbf2a8232636d96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07594v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Service"],"locations":["Wuhan China"],"keyphrases":["national level","regional level","national lockdown strategy","Phase","epidemic","Italian National Health Service","regional interventions","hit Italy","regional health systems","implementation of strict national lockdown rules","country","network of regions","administrative regions","spread","disease","study","best strategy","Italian government","effective post Lock","modelling possible restarting scenarios","months","counties","end","real data spanning","mitigating impact","provinces","states","costs","strategies","share","saturation","fact","Previous studies","federal countries","Wuhan China","policy","levels of granularity","world","heterogeneity","hot ongoing debate","nations","regionalism","future recurrence","efficacy","effectiveness","initial outbreak","decision-makers","methodology","COVID"],"language":"en"},

The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii) realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix) incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but to compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In the framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant success of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the population and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very grave situation.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kishore, Raj; Jha, Prashant Kumar; Das, Shreeja; Agarwal, Dheeresh; Maloo, Tanmay; Pegu, Hansraj; Sahoo, Devadatta; Singhal, Ankita; Sahu, Kisor K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e171aa9d88b11c4dca62ea02fa128b95c512bb06.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05684v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["different migration patterns","disease","kinetic model","different states","different geographies","different scenarios","movements patterns","framework of model assumptions","accurate state wise infection distribution","announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown","report","absence","grave situation","true state wise population density distribution","demography wise infection rate","entire country effective","Union Government of India","realistic movements of average clusters","post-COVID","effective tools","day of simulation","Indian territory","history of entire mankind","World Health Organization","Indian demographic data","large sets of realistic parameters pertinent","order","rich diversity","SARS-CoV","outbreak","present ongoing global pandemic","census","virus","rapid pace","incubation period","ground realities","significant success","implications","exercise of similar scale","magnitude","vaccine","globe","havoc","decision","tiny fraction","definitive drug","long-term prediction","standalone basis","study"],"language":"en"},

Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr), respectively. We found that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people\u0027s daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qian; Sha, Dexuan; Liu, Wei; Houser, Paul; Zhang, Luyao; Hou, Ruizhi; Lan, Hai; Flynn, Colin; Lu, Mingyue; Hu, Tao; Yang, Chaowei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bc7a03b74462d549da225547d20c9287f55dcdf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02808v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Night Time Light","Air Quality","AQI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["NTL radiance ranges","NTL detection","lower NTL radiance values","residential area pixels","commercial centers","monthly average NTL brightness","air quality of China","people\u0027s daily lives","people\u0027s lives","daily average AQI","transportation","analysis of pixels","public facilities","increased levels of brightness","Number Of Pixels","Air Quality Index","increased implementation of lockdown","cleaner air","impact of COVID","quarantine policies","provinces","quarantine period","study","earliest quarantine measures","activity ranges","crucial impact","mainland China","temporal characteristics of Night Time Light","dimming behavior","reduction of non-essential industries","significant decreasing trend","motor vehicle usage","paper","natural environment","country","classes","activities","NOP","shutdown","Wuhan","pandemic","beginning","results","hand","confirmed cases","outbreak","Observations","order","nW","conclusion","factors","sr"],"language":"en"},

Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA) is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among different regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by 18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China, Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due to restricting SA. US and Europe, in particular, show far steeper upward trends of spared infections in the analyzed timeframe, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Xinyi; Cai, Chenkai; Civil, Hui Li Department of; Engineering, Environmental; Connecticut, University of; Hydrology, College of; Resources, Water; University, Hohai; Finance, Department of","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6ec868a635063eadf61707a4141d26350336d8c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10223v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","SA","United States","Australia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["SA effect","limiting SA","China","weather conditions","weather effect","transmission of COVID","steep upward trend of spared infections","steeper upward trends of spared infections","Europe","reduced reproductive number","leading contribution","time fixed effects3","south Korea","medical facilities","control policies","analyzed timeframe","wind","relative humidity","greater risk","MOC","non-monotonic impact","Australia","adopted governmental mitigating efforts","population","unobservable factors","developed countries5","degree","Temperature","regions","United States","global scale","different regimes2","variation","economy","controlled climate","virus","socioeconomic activities","people","study","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Satellite imagery can support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers by providing a different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. Such information can be useful both during the crisis and also as we recover from it. In this work, we use a deep learning approach that combines strategic location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic indicators based on it, automatically.

The corresponding minimax MSE-problems are solved for both types of outliers separately, resulting in closed-form saddle-points which consist of an optimally-robust procedure and a corresponding least favorable outlier situation. The results are valid in a surprisingly general setup of state space models, which is not limited to a Euclidean or time-discrete framework. The solution however involves computation of conditional means in the ideal model, which may pose computational problems. In the particular situation that the ideal conditional mean is linear in the observation innovation, we come up with a straight-forward Huberization, the rLS filter, which is very easy to compute.

We derive a relation between heterogeneities in technologies and the minimum Gini coefficient required to maximize global welfare. Stronger inequalities appear to be economically unjustified. Our model may shed light on the role of non-essential goods in the economy, a topical issue when thinking about the post-Covid-19 world.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7919c425d0da63f1e182eb98aafc2d48920e2fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09835v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["productivity of essential goods","essential products","role of non-essential goods","low productivity","wage inequalities","high earners","global welfare","social welfare","Stronger inequalities","schematic economic model","minimum Gini coefficient","technologies","economy","heterogeneities","topical issue","cases","light","post-Covid","fact","world","relation"],"language":"en"},

An objective and quantitative means of monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is urgently required. Here we explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform RADAR-base as a toolbox to test the effect and response to NPIs aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19. Methods We included 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the UK, and the Netherlands. We derived features from the phone and wearable device for length of time spent at home, distance travelled from home, heart rate, sleep, and patterns of phone use. We visualised data using time series plots and performed statistical tests to assess differences in behaviour during baseline, pre-, and post-lockdown periods. Findings We found significant changes in behaviours between baseline/pre-lockdown and post-lockdown for all features except total sleep duration. In general, participants spent more time at home, travelled much less, and were more active on their phones, interacting with others by using social apps. Nevertheless, the response across nations differed with Denmark showing attenuated changes in behaviour. Interpretation Differences in the extracted features by country may reflect variations in communication and implementation of different NPIs as well as cultural differences. We have demonstrated that generalised open-source mobile health monitoring platforms such as RADAR-base which leverages data from wearables and mobile technologies are valuable tools for helping understand the behavioural impact of public health interventions implemented in response to infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Shaoxiong; Folarin, Amos; Ranjan, Yatharth; Rashid, Zulqarnain; Conde, Pauline; Stewart, Callum; Cummins, Nicholas; Matcham, Faith; Costa, Gloria Dalla; Leocani, Letizia; Sorensen, Per Soelberg; Buron, Mathias; Guerrero, Ana Isabel; Zabalza, Ana; Penninx, Brenda WJH; Lamers, Femke; Siddi, Sara; Haro, Josep Maria; Myin-Germeys, Inez; Rintala, Aki; Narayan, Vaibhav A.; Comi, Giancarlo; Hotopf, Matthew; Dobson, Richard JB","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83e0ed05ab48f5c2802c0b613bc5e8167cb77e72.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14331v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Netherlands","Denmark"],"keyphrases":["response","pre-lockdown","home","post-lockdown periods","open-source mobile health platform RADAR-base","baseline","mobile technologies","generalised open-source mobile health monitoring platforms","behavioural impact of public health interventions","extracted features","length of time","Denmark","data","Interpretation Differences","cultural differences","participants","spread of COVID","Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","time series plots","implementation of different NPIs","significant changes","attenuated changes","social distancing","social apps","total sleep duration","patterns of phone use","variations","wearables","statistical tests","behaviours","valuable tools","vaccine","communication","heart rate","countries","country","toolbox","wearable device","distance","effective treatment","infectious outbreaks","absence","Spain","nations","quantitative means","UK","Findings","Italy","local level","objective","Background","phones","Netherlands","Methods","utility"],"language":"en"},

To control the infection, the first and key step is to identify and separate the infected people. But due to the lack of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, it is essential to discover suspected COVID-19 patients via CT scan analysis by radiologists. However, CT scan analysis is usually time-consuming, requiring at least 15 minutes per case. In this paper, we develop a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels, lesion counts, infected areas and locations, benefiting various diagnosis aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification test set, and 78.3% Dice score on the segmentation test set, of our COVID-CS dataset. The online demo of our JCS diagnosis system will be available soon.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yu-Huan; Gao, Shang-Hua; Mei, Jie; Xu, Jun; Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhao, Chao-Wei; Cheng, Ming-Ming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17a7bccd1d6f13d76838f88b379591cb75be20fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07054v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","JCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected COVID","explainable COVID","JCS system","COVID-CS dataset","large scale COVID","proposed JCS diagnosis system","patients","CT images","segmentation test set","classification test set","CT scan analysis","novel Joint Classification","various diagnosis aspects","infected areas","infected people","novel coronavirus","lesion counts","locations","RT-PCR","lack of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction","pixel-level labels","Dice score","countries","tests","radiologists","online demo","pandemic disease","billions of humans","Extensive experiments","uninfected cases","infection","key step","minutes","paper","specificity","average sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and a selection of pretrained CNN models are trained on publicly available CXR collections to learn CXR modality-specific feature representations and the learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying normal, bacterial pneumonia, and CXRs exhibiting COVID-19 abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information leakage and reduce generalization errors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the individual constituent models. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions.

RESULTS: The population attack rates and case fatality rates vary from country to country with Lombardy in northern Italy reporting an attack rate in the general population of 0.37% compared to 0.004% in Hong Kong. The differences are caused by different testing strategies and reporting systems. CONCLUSION: Turkey is early in the outbreak. Different control strategies are available with South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore being models to follow.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"PETERSEN, Eskild; G\u00D6KENG\u0130N, Deniz","journal":"Turk J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b3f8c62edca0ef4c248b33d8d7f00487e5d1542.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195978.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2003-260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Turkey","Lombardy","South Korea","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["different countries","Different control strategies","country","population attack rates","different testing strategies","Hong Kong","differences","Turkey","general population","reporting systems","case fatality rates","current knowledge of COVID","South Korea","northern Italy","Coronavirus Infectious Disease","Singapore","Lombardy","BACKGROUND","AIM","METHODS","MATERIALS","models","RESULTS","epidemiology","SARS-CoV","pandemic","CONCLUSION","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we assess mechanisms of RNA condensation and how cells modulate this phenomenon. We propose that cells control RNA condensation through ATP-dependent processes, static RNA buffering, and dynamic post-translational mechanisms. Moreover, perturbations in these mechanisms can be involved in disease. This reveals multiple cellular mechanisms of kinetic and thermodynamic control to maintain the proper distribution of RNA molecules between dispersed and condensed forms.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tauber, Devin; Tauber, Gabriel; Parker, Roy","journal":"Trends Biochem Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f93ee6b4bfbe21346fd7bfea31b7d4dc95a2886f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968000420301213; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000420301213?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of RNA condensation","RNA interactions","RNA-based condensation","trans RNA condensation","static RNA buffering","RNA-protein assemblies","formation of intermolecular RNA","multiple aspects of RNA metabolism","proper distribution of RNA molecules","cells","multiple cellular mechanisms of kinetic","dynamic post-translational mechanisms","disease","RNP granules form","thermodynamic control","ATP-dependent processes","condensed forms","memory","Abstract Ribonucleoprotein","development","phenomenon","perturbations"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, the possibility of using emodin as a potential antiviral to treat CVB(4) infection was explored in vitro and in mice. Emodin reduced CVB(4) entry and replication on Hep-2 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 12.06 \u03BCM and selectivity index (SI) of 5.08, respectively. The inhibitory effect of emodin for CVB(4) entry and replication was further confirmed by a quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) assay. The results further showed that the mice orally treated with different dosages of emodin displayed a dose dependent increase of survival rate, body weight and prolonged mean time of death (MTD), accompanied by significantly decreased myocardial virus titers and pathologic scores/lesions. Moreover, emodin could inhibit CVB(4)-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

Rhinovirus was the main contributor to the RV/EV group as shown by the assay used during the 2016\u20102018 period. RV/EV and adenoviruses detected throughout the year. Influenza virus was most frequently detected during January to March when both RSV and metapneumovirus were also in circulation. The coinfection percentage was 10.2%. Rhinovirus was the most common virus in coinfections while RSV plus rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most frequent combination.

Administration of human PBMCs into newly developed murine MHC class I- and class II-deficient NOG (NOG-dKO; NOG- Iab, B2m-double-knockout) mice showed sufficient engraftment of human immune cells with little sign of GVHD. Immunization with influenza vaccine resulted in an increase in influenza-specific human IgG Ab, indicating induction of antigen-specific B cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Immunization with human dendritic cells pulsed with HLA-A2 restricted cytomegalovirus peptide induced specific cytotoxic T cells, indicating the induction of antigen-specific T cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) using melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1)-specific TCR-transduced activated T cells showed strong tumor growth inhibition in NOG-dKO mice without any sign of GVHD accompanied by preferential expansion of the transferred MART-1-specific T cells. ACTs using cultured human melanoma infiltrating T cells also showed anti-tumor effects against autologous melanoma cells in NOG-dKO mice, in which changes in human cancer phenotypes by immune intervention, such as increased CD271 expression, could be evaluated. Therefore, NOG-dKO mice are useful tools for more detailed analysis of both the induction and effector phases of T-cell and B-cell responses for a longer period than regular NOG mice.","publish_time":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yaguchi, Tomonori; Kobayashi, Asuka; Inozume, Takashi; Morii, Kenji; Nagumo, Haruna; Nishio, Hiroshi; Iwata, Takashi; Ka, Yuyo; Katano, Ikumi; Ito, Ryoji; Ito, Mamoru; Kawakami, Yutaka","journal":"Cellular \u0026 Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec119e55e550fa9ecd1b3fdd91a21e6f88732880.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6207709.xml.json","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2017106.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2017.106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151581/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific T cells","NOG-dKO mice","human dendritic cells","specific B cells","regular NOG mice","specific cytotoxic T cells","human peripheral blood cells","NOG- Iab","deficient NOG","autologous melanoma cells","sufficient engraftment of human immune cells","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","Immunodeficient mice","specific TCR-transduced activated T cells","cultured human melanoma","Administration of human PBMCs","influenza-specific human IgG Ab","human cancer phenotypes","analysis of human patient individual immune responses","melanoma antigen","induction of antigen","effector phases of T","B-cell responses","immune intervention","little sign of GVHD","ACTs","transferred MART","Immunization","long term detailed analysis","Adoptive cell therapies","promising tools","useful tools","influenza vaccine","anti-tumor effects","strong tumor growth inhibition","developed murine MHC class","HLA-A2 restricted cytomegalovirus peptide","host disease","longer period","knockout","severe graft","B2m-double","null","preferential expansion","Shi-scid","rg","increased CD271 expression"],"language":"en"},

Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published. We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak. METHODS: We did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase\u0027s adaptation of Colaizzi\u0027s phenomenological method. FINDINGS: We recruited nine nurses and four physicians. Three theme categories emerged from data analysis. The first was \u201Cbeing fully responsible for patients\u0027 wellbeing\u2014\u2018this is my duty\u2019\u201D. Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was \u201Cchallenges of working on COVID-19 wards\u201D. Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients\u0027 conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was \u201Cresilience amid challenges\u201D. Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience. INTERPRETATION: The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally. Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers. Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.

In our previous publication, we have shown that GRFT exerted antiviral activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Herein, we further elucidated the mechanism by which GRFT inhibits JEV infection in BHK-21 cells. In vitro experiments using Pull-down assay and Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay showed that GRFT binds to the JEV glycosylated viral proteins, specifically the enveloped (E) and premature (prM) glycoproteins. The binding of GRFT to the JEV was competitively inhibited by increasing concentrations of mannose; in turns abolished anti-JEV activity of GRFT.

Non-pharmaceutical measures are important to prevent the spread of AI and to contain a pandemic. The effectiveness of such measures is largely dependent on the behaviour of the population. Risk perception is a central element in changing behaviour. This study aimed to investigate perceived vulnerability, severity and precautionary behaviour related to AI in the Netherlands during seven consecutive surveys in 2006 - 2007 as well as possible trends in risk perception and self-reported precautionary behaviours. METHODS: Seven web-based surveys were conducted including 3,840 respondents over a one-year period. Time trends were analyzed with linear regression analyses. Multivariate analysis was used to study determinants of precautionary behaviour. RESULTS: While infection with AI was considered a very severe health problem with mean score of 4.57 (scale 1 - 5); perceived vulnerability was much lower, with a mean score of 1.69. While perceived severity remained high, perceived vulnerability decreased slightly during a one-year period covering part of 2006 and 2007. Almost half of the respondents (46%) reported taking one or more preventive measures, with 36% reporting to have stayed away from (wild) birds or poultry. In multivariate logistic regression analysis the following factors were significantly associated with taking preventive measures: time of the survey, higher age, lower level of education, non-Dutch ethnicity, vaccinated against influenza, higher perceived severity, higher perceived vulnerability, higher self efficacy, lower level of knowledge, more information about AI, and thinking more about AI. Self efficacy was a stronger predictor of precautionary behaviour for those who never or seldom think about AI (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9 - 2.7), compared to those who think about AI more often (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 - 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that perceived severity of AI appears to be high and remains so over time offers a good point of departure for more specific risk communications to promote precautionary actions. Such communications should aim at improving knowledge about the disease and preventive actions, and focus on perceived personal vulnerability and self efficacy in taking preventive measures.","publish_time":"2010-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Zwart, Onno; Veldhuijzen, Irene K; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Brug, Johannes","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1b2eb98641f5fbf2b51cb26566196ae59a7ad96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2885389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20462419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["perceived severity of AI","higher perceived vulnerability","spread of AI","higher perceived severity","perceived personal vulnerability","preventive measures","determinants of precautionary behaviour","precautionary actions","higher self efficacy","stronger predictor of precautionary behaviour","preventive actions","changing behaviour","Non-pharmaceutical measures","higher age","Risk perception","Time trends","lower level of knowledge","self-reported precautionary behaviours","lower level of education","specific risk communications","Multivariate analysis","mean score","respondents","year period","study","multivariate logistic regression analysis","ongoing spread","Avian influenza","possible trends","pandemic potential","consecutive surveys","public health challenge","non-Dutch ethnicity","severe health problem","linear regression analyses","web-based surveys","following factors","good point of departure","central element","Netherlands","information","METHODS","BACKGROUND","disease","scale","CONCLUSIONS","birds","poultry","effectiveness","population","RESULTS","infection","reporting","half"],"language":"en"},

In this study we have analyzed the role of two domains in the S protein on fusion. The 180-kDa mature S protein is partially cleaved into two 90-kDa subunits during transport to the plasma membrane. We have identified several amino acids that are important for cleavage of S, and we show that cleavage is not strictly required for fusion. However, the level of cleavage seems to influence the fusion kinetics. After introduction of an arginine at position P2to mimick the MHV-JHM cleavage site, full cleavage of the spike protein was obtained. Further, we analyzed the effect of mutations in the transmembrane (TM) domain of the S protein. Maturation and cell surface expression of the mutant proteins were not affected, and all proteins became acylated. The mutant in which the predicted transmembrane domain was shortened did not induce syncytia. From a group of mutants in which several conserved cysteines in the TM domain had been replaced by serines, one was unable to induce syncytia, another showed delayed syncytia formation, and the third mutant induced syncytia as did the wild-type protein. The potential role of the transmembrane domain in fusion is discussed.","publish_time":"1995-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"BOS, EVELYNE C.W.; HEIJNEN, LEO; LUYTJES, WILLEM; SPAAN, WILLY J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5feb92f2b38534fffa4575de8a13e46483fc1481.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285700566; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285700566","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cleavage of S","membrane protein","spike protein","membrane fusion","kDa mature S protein","wild-type protein","TM domain","level of cleavage","fusion kinetics","predicted transmembrane domain","mutant induced syncytia","mutant proteins","protein of murine coronavirus strain A59","MHV-JHM cleavage site","MHV-A59","plasma membrane","delayed syncytia formation","kDa subunits","potential role","position P2to mimick","arginine","cell surface expression","conserved cysteines","transport","domains","Maturation","introduction","amino acids","serines","group of mutants","effect of mutations","study"],"language":"en"},

Different hosts or host tissues provide different cellular environments, especially different antiviral and RNA modification activities that can alter RNA modification signatures observed in the viral RNA genome. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds specifically to CpG dinucleotides and recruits other proteins to degrade a variety of viral RNA genomes. Many mammalian RNA viruses have evolved CpG deficiency. Increasing CpG dinucleotides in these low-CpG viral genomes in the presence of ZAP consistently leads to decreased viral replication and virulence. Because ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expression, viruses infecting different tissues are expected to have different CpG signatures, suggesting a means to identify viral tissue-switching events. I show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency in all known Betacoronavirus genomes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression. A survey of CpG deficiency in viral genomes identified a virulent canine coronavirus (Alphacoronavirus) as possessing the most extreme CpG deficiency, comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that the canine tissue infected by the canine coronavirus may provide a cellular environment strongly selecting against CpG. Thus, viral surveys focused on decreasing CpG in viral RNA genomes may provide important clues about the selective environments and viral defenses in the original hosts.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Xuhua","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d122d684fc5cd606b5bb53f8e5e09099c86749d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289821/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa094","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CpG","ZAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral tissue","low-CpG viral genomes","CpG dinucleotides","different CpG signatures","decreasing CpG","extreme CpG deficiency","evolved CpG deficiency","variety of viral RNA genomes","viral defenses","viral surveys","viral replication","survey of CpG deficiency","different tissues","different antiviral","Different hosts","canine tissue","RNA modification signatures","mammalian RNA viruses","deadly SARS-CoV","different cellular environments","RNA modification activities","new host tissue","known Betacoronavirus genomes","host tissues","presence of ZAP","ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expression","high ZAP expression","virulent canine coronavirus","selective environments","original hosts","natural reservoir of Betacoronavirus","Wild mammalian species","zinc finger antiviral protein","important clues","bats","means","Alphacoronavirus","MERS","proteins","virulence","events"],"language":"en"},

Expression of co-stimulatory molecules on immune cells is also affected in atopic asthmatics, suggesting an aberrant immune response to RV that may lead to suboptimal viral clearance and viral persistence. Some of the above effects can be reversed in vitro by corticosteroids, second-generation antihistamines or anti-oxidants; however, the optimal strategy for treating acute asthma exacerbations requires further research at both mechanistic and clinical levels.","publish_time":"2004-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Papi, Alberto; Psarras, Stelios; Johnston, Sebastian L","journal":"Paediatr Respir Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76a5e73868cce4841bfb43ff7c775bc2f02f6ee3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172503.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054204000284; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054204000284","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVs","immune cells","viral shedding","viral persistence","epithelial cells","experimental RV infection","interferon-\u03B3","interleukin","atopic asthmatics","majority of acute asthma exacerbations","suboptimal viral clearance","aberrant immune response","Atopic asthmatic individuals","common colds","upper respiratory tract infections","research","anti-oxidants","optimal strategy","corticosteroids","normal subjects","sensitive detection methodologies","Expression of co-stimulatory molecules","epidemiological studies","second-generation antihistamines","lower airways","clinical levels","pro-inflammatory mediators","Symptom severity","human rhinoviruses","circumstances","status","epithelium","effects"],"language":"en"},

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mei, Xueyan; Lee, Hao-Chih; Diao, Kai-Yue; Huang, Mingqian; Lin, Bin; Liu, Chenyu; Xie, Zongyu; Ma, Yixuan; Robson, Philip M; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Mani, Venkatesh; Calcagno, Claudia; Li, Kunwei; Li, Shaolin; Shan, Hong; Lv, Jian; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Long, Qihua; Steinberger, Sharon; Jacobi, Adam; Deyer, Timothy; Luksza, Marta; Liu, Fang; Little, Brent P; Fayad, Zahi A; Yang, Yang","journal":"Nature medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427924/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0931-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","evaluation of patients","detection of patients","accurate diagnosis of patients","PCR test kits","real-time RT-PCR assay","generation sequencing RT-PCR","chest CT findings","shortage of RT","normal CT scans","suspected SARS-CoV","proposed AI system","test set","clinical history","infection","normal radiological findings","diagnosis of coronavirus disease","negative predictive value","clinical symptoms","exposure history","laboratory testing","possibility of false negative results","serial testing","Chest computed tomography","virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","urgent need","alternative methods","algorithms","early stages","valuable component","curve","artificial intelligence","equal sensitivity","senior thoracic radiologist","area","study","total","radiologists"],"language":"en"},

In mammals, mutations in polyQ segments (and CAG repeats at the nucleotide level) have been linked to neural disorders and ataxias. PolyQ regions in normal human proteins have documented functional roles, in transcription factors and, more recently, in regulating autophagy. Despite the high frequency of polyQ repeats in eukaryotic genomes, little attention has been given to the presence or possible role of polyQ sequences in virus genomes. A survey described here revealed that polyQ repeats occur rarely in RNA viruses, suggesting that they have detrimental effects on virus replication at the nucleotide or protein level. However, there have been sporadic reports of polyQ segments in potyviruses and in reptilian nidoviruses (among the largest RNA viruses known). Conserved polyQ segments are found in the regulatory control proteins of many DNA viruses. Variable length polyQ tracts are found in proteins that contribute to transmissibility (cowpox A-type inclusion protein (ATI)) and control of latency (herpes viruses). New longer-read sequencing methods, using original biological samples, should reveal more details on the presence and functional role of polyQ in viruses, as well as the nucleotide regions that encode them. Given the known toxic effects of polyQ repeats, the role of these segments in neurovirulent and tumorigenic viruses should be further explored.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study. In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. INTERVENTION: Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 \u00B1 9.3 vs 12.2 \u00B1 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 \u00B1 8.3 vs 18.8 \u00B1 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment. One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding. Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations. PATIENT SUMMARY: Immunosuppressed transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia, but most of them still achieved a good prognosis after appropriate treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Lan; Gong, Nianqiao; Liu, Bin; Lu, Xia; Chen, Dong; Chen, Song; Shu, Hongge; Ma, Ke; Xu, Xizhen; Guo, Zhiliang; Lu, Enfeng; Chen, Dongrui; Ge, Qinggang; Cai, Junchao; Jiang, Jipin; Wei, Lai; Zhang, Weijie; Chen, Gang; Chen, Zhishui","journal":"Eur Urol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a51f54c6e1214edb093da6b796211a8da9f3447a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166037.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283820302141; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0302283820302141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe pneumonia","severe COVID","severity of pneumonia","treatment of COVID","renal transplant recipients","outcomes of COVID","severity of COVID","control group","Immunosuppressed transplant recipients","kidney transplant recipients","transplant patients","radiological characteristics of COVID","clinical outcomes","severe case","small group of cases","clinical features","longer time of virus shedding","immunosuppressed populations","prolonged clinical course","coronavirus disease","laboratory","acute renal graft failure","critical cases vs","STATISTICAL ANALYSIS","longer course of illness","immunocompromised populations","appropriate treatment","general population","transient renal allograft damage","PATIENT SUMMARY","length of illness","progressive respiratory failure","recovery rate","Immunosuppressant reduction","infection","lack data","important implications","low-dose methylprednisolone therapy","total","normal immunity","Previous studies","PARTICIPANTS","BACKGROUND","LIMITATIONS","OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS","family members","SETTING","INTERVENTION","good prognosis","RESULTS","Findings","CONCLUSIONS","DESIGN","addition","OBJECTIVE","retrospective study"],"language":"en"},

This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel and geographically agnostic framework (the 4Ps Framework) to guide multidisciplinary, scalable, resource-efficient, and achievable efforts towards enhanced testing capacity. The 4Ps (Prioritize, Propagate, Partition, and Provide) are described in terms of specific opportunities to enhance the volume, diversity, characterization, and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 testing to benefit public health. Coordinated deployment of the strategic and tactical recommendations described in this framework have the potential to rapidly expand available testing capacity, improve public health decision-making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or to be applied in future emergent disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pettit, S D; Jerome, K R; Rouquie, D; Mari, B; Barbry, P; Kanda, Y; Matsumoto, M; Hester, S; Wehmas, L; Botten, J W; Bruce, E A","journal":"EMBO molecular medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202012634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enhanced testing capacity","available testing capacity","Ps Framework","public health decision-making","labor capacity","SARS-CoV","agnostic framework","resource-efficient","material resource","implementation of SARS","spread of COVID","achievable efforts","response","tactical recommendations","clinical community","volume","diversity","characterization","potential","Coordinated deployment","future emergent disease outbreaks","terms of specific opportunities","ability","novel","pragmatic guidance","Current demand","globe","result","limitation","objective","pandemic","broad consensus","paper","Partition"],"language":"en"},

We found that a mutation at amino acid position 90 in the H5N1 HA, outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD), could simultaneously induce changes in the RBD conformation to escape from nAb binding and alter the receptor preference through long-range regulation. This mutation was deemed a \u201Ckey event\u201D for interspecies transmission. It is likely a result of positive selection caused by antibodies, allowing the original invasion by new species-specific variants. A mutation at amino acid position 160 in the RBD only induced a change in receptor preference. This mutation was deemed a \u201Cmaintaining adaptation\u201D, which ensured that influenza virus variants would be able to infect new organisms of a different species successfully.

Studies investigating the association between air pollution and academic attainment have been constrained by small sample sizes. METHODS: Cross sectional educational attainment data (2009\u20132015) from students aged 15\u201316 years in Cardiff, Wales were linked to primary health care data, modelled air pollution and measured pollen data, and analysed using multilevel linear regression models. Annual cohort, school and individual level confounders were adjusted for in single and multi-pollutant/pollen models. We stratified by treatment of asthma and/or Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR). RESULTS: A unit (10\u03BCg/m3) increase of short-term exposure to NO(2) was associated with 0.044 (95% CI: \u22120.079, \u22120.008) reduction of standardised Capped Point Score (CPS) after adjusting for individual and household risk factors for 18,241 students. This association remained statistically significant after controlling for other pollutants and pollen. There was no association of PM(2.5), O(3), or Pollen with standardised CPS remaining after adjustment. We found no evidence that treatment for asthma or SAR modified the observed NO(2) effect on educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that short-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution, specifically NO(2,) was associated with detrimental educational attainment for students aged 15\u201316. Longitudinal investigations in different settings are required to confirm this possible impact and further work may uncover the long-term economic implications, and degree to which impacts are cumulative and permanent.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizen, Amy; Lyons, Jane; Milojevic, Ai; Doherty, Ruth; Wilkinson, Paul; Carruthers, David; Akbari, Ashley; Lake, Iain; Davies, Gwyneth A.; Al Sallakh, Mohammad; Fry, Richard; Dearden, Lorraine; Rodgers, Sarah","journal":"Health Place","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7214342.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829220300368?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1353829220300368","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis","SAR","Capped Point Score","CPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["students","modelled air pollution","pollen models","measured pollen data","detrimental educational attainment","traffic-related air pollution","academic attainment","Cross sectional educational attainment data","short-term exposure","standardised CPS","SAR","evidence","treatment of asthma","association of PM","primary health care data","exam results","individual level confounders","multilevel linear regression models","reduction of standardised Capped Point Score","work","degree","Wales","school","METHODS","Annual cohort","long-term economic implications","Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis","impacts","\u03BCg","m3","study","household risk factors","multi-pollutant","different settings","Longitudinal investigations","Cardiff","unit","small sample sizes","years","effect","adjustment","Studies","possible impact","CONCLUSION","pollutants","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, plays important roles in the process of virus replication and cellular infection. Virus infection and transfection showed that N protein was predominately localized in the cytoplasm, but also found in the nucleolus in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, by utilizing fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP), deletion mutations or site-directed mutagenesis of PEDV N protein, coupled with live cell imaging and confocal microscopy, it was revealed that, a region spanning amino acids (aa), 71\u201390 in region 1 of the N protein was sufficient for nucleolar localization and R87 and R89 were critical for its function. We also identified two nuclear export signals (NES, aa221\u2013236, and 325\u2013364), however, only the nuclear export signal (aa325\u2013364) was found to be functional in the context of the full-length N protein. Finally, the activity of this nuclear export signal (NES) was inhibited by the antibiotic Lepomycin B, suggesting that N is exported by a chromosome region maintenance 1-related export pathway.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Da; Lv, Maojie; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Zhang, Sha; Zhang, Xin; Feng, Li","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/507796937879c600ac886d0aa7080e73bedb5044.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3970149.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v6031253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632575/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length N protein","mutagenesis of PEDV N protein","green fluorescent protein","nuclear export signals","Virus infection","related export pathway","nucleolus","process of virus replication","chromosome region maintenance","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","eukaryotic cell","cellular infection","live cell imaging","GFP","nucleolar localization","site","deletion mutations","important roles","coronavirus nucleocapsid","R89","R87","fusion proteins","dynamic subnuclear structure","normal operation","confocal microscopy","aa221","context","transfection","antibiotic Lepomycin B","Vero E6 cells","amino acids","aa325","activity","function","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. Research Question Whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms remains unknown. Study Design and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9th to March 5th, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. Results The outcome was recovery and hospital discharge in 86% of patients, while 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%), while 5.2% showed no obvious symptoms. High fever (\u003E39.0\u00B0C) was more common in severe cases than recovered cases (18.6% versus 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in severe patients (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P\u003C.0001).

A discussion of this concept is presented here by the members of a Task Force on Global Health Diplomacy of the American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel on Global Nursing and Health (AAN EPGNH). The purpose of this article is to present an integrative review of literature on the concept of global health diplomacy and to identify implications of this emerging field for nursing education, practice, and research. The steps proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) were adapted and applied to the integrative review of theoretical and descriptive articles about the concept of global health diplomacy. This review included an analysis of the historical background, definition, and challenges of global health diplomacy and suggestions about the preparation of global health diplomats. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for nursing practice, education, and research. The Task Force endorses the definition of global health diplomacy proposed by Adams, Novotny, and Leslie (2008) but recommends that further dialogue and research is necessary to identify opportunities and educational requirements for nurses to contribute to the emerging field of global health diplomacy.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunter, Anita; Wilson, Lynda; Stanhope, Marcia; Hatcher, Barbara; Hattar, Marianne; Hilfinger Messias, DeAnne K.; Powell, Dorothy","journal":"Nursing Outlook","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d95fb677837e1d2572cfdc7dd95a630d5f64930d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118513.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2012.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999856/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029655412002308; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0029655412002308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Adams","Leslie"],"organizations":["Task Force"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concept of global health diplomacy","definition of global health diplomacy","Global Nursing","challenges of global health diplomacy","evolving practice of global health diplomacy","emerging field of global health diplomacy","preparation of global health diplomats","nursing practice","nursing literature","nursing education","research","discussion of implications","integrative review of literature","Task Force","integrative review of theoretical","limited discussion","American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel","role of nurses","suggestions","descriptive articles","opportunities","foundation","Adams","historical background","educational requirements","analysis","world","factors","Novotny","members","AAN EPGNH","increasing interconnectedness","steps","Whittemore","Knafl","Leslie","initiatives","dialogue","purpose"],"language":"en"},

To better understand the molecular characteristics of isolated SVA genomes, we first reported genome-wide comprehensive analyses of codon usage and various factors that have contribute to the molecular evolution in SVA. The effective number of codons (ENC) ranged from 54.51 to 55.54 with an average of 54.87 \u00B1 0.285, which reveals a relatively stable nucleotide composition. We found that codon usage bias of the SVA was low. Mutational pressure acted as an increasingly dominant factor for the evolution of the virus compared with the natural selection. Notably, codon usage bias was also affected by the geographic distribution and isolated time. The first systemic analysis on the codon usage bias of the SVA provides important information for the understanding of the evolution of the SVA and has fundamental and theoretical benefits.","publish_time":"2017-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ye; Xu, Quanming; Tan, Chen; Li, Xinxin; Chi, Xiaojuan; Cai, Binxiang; Yu, Ziding; Ma, Yanmei; Chen, Ji-Long","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8d10b88b19b3c3868df62947e2a71aa6378aee0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172466.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.09.040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401017310483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28943149/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401017310483","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVA"],"locations":["Brazil","United States of America","Canada"],"keyphrases":["codon usage bias","molecular evolution","molecular characteristics of isolated SVA genomes","reported genome-wide comprehensive analyses of codon usage","isolated time","various factors","important information","understanding","United States of America","pigs","Brazil","dominant factor","systemic analysis","geographic distribution","effective number of codons","ENC","Canada","infection","theoretical benefits","Mutational pressure","stable nucleotide composition","Senecavirus","average"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Nineteen thousand nine hundred seven dogs from pet hospitals in the cities of Luoyang, Anyang, Jiaozuo, Sanmenxia, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou in Henan province between 2009 and 2014 were investigated. Over the 6-year period, 1169 CPV-positive cases were identified and the morbidity of CPV infection ranged from 4.16 to 8.06 %, although morbidity was not significant (P \u003E 0.05) between 2009 and 2014. Factors associated with morbidity included sampling season, dog age, breed, vaccination status, and sex. CPV co-infection with coccidium (10.00 %), canine distemper virus (4.79 %), hookworm (2.40 %), canine coronavirus (1.11 %), roundworm (1.03 %), tapeworm (0.17 %) and Babesia spp. (0.09 %) were observed.

Following viral infection, diverse cell signaling pathways are initiated by the cells, with the major goal of establishing an antiviral state. However, viruses have been shown to exploit cellular signaling pathways for their own effective replication. Genome-wide siRNA screens have also identified numerous host factors that either support (proviral) or inhibit (antiviral) virus replication. Some of the host factors might be dispensable for the host but may be critical for virus replication; therefore such cellular factors may serve as targets for development of antiviral therapeutics. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a major cell signaling pathway that is known to be activated by diverse group of viruses. MAPK interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) has been shown to regulate both cap-dependent and internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES)-mediated mRNA translation.

This dynamic process is regulated by many executors and regulators for efficient eradication of invading viruses and protection from harmful, excessive responses. An array of innate sensors recognizes virus-derived nucleic acids to activate their downstream signaling to evoke cytokine responses including interferons. In particular, a cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) is involved in the detection of multiple types of not only RNA viruses but also DNA viruses. Accumulating findings have revealed that activation of nucleic acid sensors and the related signaling mediators is regulated on the basis of post-translational modification such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation. In addition, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated as a new class of regulators in innate signaling. A comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of innate sensor activation and its signaling in host\u2013virus interaction will provide a better therapeutic strategy to efficiently control viral infection and maintain immune homeostasis.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takaoka, Akinori; Yamada, Taisho","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a12e2a81b85700aa8b88c27f9f6aa716380eb674.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110195.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxz034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30985869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","viral infection","activation of nucleic acid sensors","DNA viruses","array of innate sensors","interferons","regulatory mechanisms of innate sensor activation","efficient eradication of invading viruses","cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG","virus interaction","virus-derived nucleic acids","important anti-viral cytokines","excessive responses","cytokine responses","new class of regulators","retinoic acid-inducible gene","protection","ubiquitination","better therapeutic strategy","phosphorylation","executors","basis of post-translational modification","non-coding RNAs","mediators","host","comprehensive understanding","detection of multiple types","addition","lncRNAs","ADP-ribosylation","immune homeostasis","Accumulating findings","dynamic process"],"language":"en"},

RBC loading with drugs can be performed in several ways-either via encapsulation within the RBC or surface coupling, and either ex vivo or in vivo-depending on the intended application. In this review, we briefly summarize currently used technologies for RBC loading/coupling with an eye on how pharmacokinetics is impacted. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of key ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) changes that would be expected for RBC-associated drugs and address unique features of RBC pharmacokinetics. As thorough understanding of pharmacokinetics is critical in successful translation to the clinic, we expect that this review will provide a jumping off point for further investigations into this area.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glassman, Patrick M; Villa, Carlos H; Ukidve, Anvay; Zhao, Zongmin; Smith, Paige; Mitragotri, Samir; Russell, Alan J; Brenner, Jacob S; Muzykantov, Vladimir R","journal":"Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12050440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBC loading","RBC-associated drugs","unique features of RBC pharmacokinetics","RBC-mediated drug delivery","drug delivery systems","great potential","thorough understanding of pharmacokinetics","review","industrial drug development","unprecedented changes","surface coupling","absorption","distribution","metabolism","detailed description of key ADME","successful translation","used technologies","point","clinic","elimination","academic lab","pharmacodynamics","encapsulation","Red blood cells","eye","investigations","jumping","years of research","area","ways","ex","immunogenicity","intended application"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination has eradicated smallpox, nearly eradicated poliomyelitis and greatly reduced many other highly dangerous infections such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. New diseases such as HIV and new forms of influenza have taken both professional and popular opinion by surprise and have renewed the challenges before the world public health community. Emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of common organisms due to overuse of antibiotics and lack of vaccines for many dangerous microorganisms poses problems to humanity. This stresses the need for new vaccines, effective antibiotics and strengthened environmental control measures. New knowledge of the microbiological origins of cancers such as that of the cervix, stomach and liver have strengthened primary prevention and brought hope that new cures will be found for other chronic diseases of infectious origin. Tragically long delays in adopting \u201Cnew\u201D and cost effective vaccines cause hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year in developing and mid-level developed countries.

In this study, we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of TGEV infection on glucose uptake and SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression. Our data demonstrate that infection with TGEV resulted in increased glucose uptake and augmented expression of EGFR, SGLT1 and GLUT2. Moreover, inhibition studies showed that EGFR modulated glucose uptake in control and TGEV infected cells.

The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human.

Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti\u2013human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M(2) inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. This article provides an overview of clinically available antiviral drugs for the primary care physician, with a special focus on pharmacology, clinical uses, and adverse effects.","publish_time":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razonable, Raymund R.","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd93901764246aed67d92ff0786d6ca225e5c078.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1320a8a828a5da3f25000357252e14fb19547e2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3184032.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619611652439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964179/; https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2011.0309; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619611652439; http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025619611652439/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of chronic hepatitis C","treatment of chronic hepatitis B","clinical utility of antiviral drugs","replication of hepatitis B virus","backbone treatment","hepatitis C virus genotype","treatment of cytomegalovirus","antiherpes drugs","available antiviral drugs target","treatment of influenza infections","viral replication","DNA viruses","Widespread antiviral resistance","viral DNA polymerase gene","treatment outcome of patients","activation of certain drugs","viral kinases","specific antiviral therapy","viral diseases","influenza viruses","clinical uses","human immunodeficiency virus properties","Drug resistance","respiratory syncytial virus","ribavirin","competitive substrates","ide analogues","combination of nucleos","exception","Combination therapy","multiple potential clinical applications","main groups of viruses","Interferon-\u03B1","addition of serine protease inhibitors","mutations","special focus","primary care physician","cidofovir","genes","self-limited illnesses","emerging threat","antisense molecule fomivirsen","pharmacology","protein","acyclovir","major mechanisms","ion channel","prevention","overview","adverse effects","ganciclovir","enzyme neuraminidase","article"],"language":"en"},

This conserved mechanism by which cytoplasmic cargo is delivered to the endolysosomal system is now recognized as a central player in coordinating the host response to diverse intracellular pathogens, including viruses. As an endolysosomal delivery system, autophagy functions in the transfer of viruses from the cytoplasm to the lysosome where they are degraded, in the transfer of viral nucleic acids to endosomal sensors for the activation of innate immunity, and in the transfer of endogenous viral antigens to MHC class II compartments for the activation of adaptive immunity. Viruses have, in turn, evolved different strategies to antagonize, and potentially, to exploit the host autophagic machinery. Moreover, through mechanisms not yet well understood, autophagy may dampen host innate immune and inflammatory responses to viral infection. This review highlights the roles of autophagy in antiviral immunity, viral strategies to evade autophagy, and potential negative feedback functions of autophagy in the host antiviral response.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shoji-Kawata, Sanae; Levine, Beth","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d77078dcc719ace0848a3584d9e287fa5b8618c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/07742c18d104719c2b0cafbb594795cbced62c31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2739265.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264100/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.02.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488909000573; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2739265?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488909000573","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autophagy functions","roles of autophagy","autophagy pathway","viral strategies","host response","transfer of viruses","host antiviral response","viral infection","antiviral immunity","activation of innate immunity","transfer of endogenous viral antigens","transfer of viral nucleic acids","potential negative feedback functions of autophagy","activation of adaptive immunity","endolysosomal system","host autophagic machinery","endolysosomal delivery system","different strategies","compartments","endosomal sensors","MHC class","inflammatory responses","diverse intracellular pathogens","cytoplasmic cargo","cells","central player","tissue homeostasis","conserved mechanism","turn","microbial attack","lysosome","review","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Western Hemisphere shrimp farmers in 14 countries in 2004 produced more than 200,000 metric tons of shrimp, generated more than $2 billion in revenue, and employed more than 500,000 people. Disease has had a major impact on shrimp aquaculture in the Americas since it became a significant commercial entity in the 1970s. Diseases due to viruses, rickettsial-like bacteria, true bacteria, protozoa, and fungi have emerged as major diseases of farmed shrimp in the region. Many of the bacterial, fungal and protozoan caused diseases are managed using improved culture practices, routine sanitation, and the use of chemotherapeutics. However, the virus diseases have been far more problematic to manage and they have been responsible for the most costly epizootics. Examples include the Taura syndrome pandemic that began in 1991\u20131992 when the disease emerged in Ecuador, and the subsequent White Spot Disease pandemic that followed its introduction to Central America from Asia in 1999. Because of their socioeconomic significance to shrimp farming, seven of the nine crustacean diseases listed by the World Animal Organization (OIE) are virus diseases of shrimp. Of the seven virus diseases of penaeid shrimp, five are native to the Americas or have become enzootic following their introduction. The shrimp virus diseases in the Americas are increasingly being managed by exclusion using a combination of biosecurity and the practice of culturing domesticated specific pathogen-free (SPF) stocks or specific pathogen-resistant (SPR) stocks. Despite the significant challenges posed by disease, the shrimp farming industry of the Americas has responded to the challenges posed by disease and it has developed methods to manage its diseases and mature into a sustainable industry.","publish_time":"2011-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lightner, D.V.","journal":"J Invertebr Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b100dada59fc9de54b13dff9c34ec5e5a38ea366.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172539.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201110002168; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022201110002168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21215359/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2010.09.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pacific White Shrimp"],"locations":["Americas","Western Hemisphere","Central America","Asia"],"keyphrases":["virus diseases of shrimp","shrimp virus diseases","virus diseases of penaeid shrimp","major diseases of farmed shrimp","shrimp farming industry","crustacean diseases","Penaeid shrimp aquaculture","Americas","Pacific White Shrimp","metric tons of shrimp","protozoan caused diseases","Western Hemisphere shrimp farmers","important industry","sustainable industry","subsequent White Spot Disease pandemic","stocks","introduction","significant challenges","specific pathogen-free","specific pathogen-resistant","true bacteria","major impact","improved culture practices","Taura syndrome pandemic","significant commercial entity","SPF","OIE","routine sanitation","World Animal Organization","practice of culturing","rickettsial","fungi","countries","SPR","Ecuador","Litopenaeus vannamei","combination of biosecurity","Central America","Examples","Asia","exclusion","viruses","region","use of chemotherapeutics","costly epizootics","socioeconomic significance","methods","revenue","people"],"language":"en"},

Those cells were chemoattracted by chemokines inside the central nervous system (CNS) after blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. cRNAs from TMEV- and mock-infected astrocytes cells were hybridized to the Affymetrix murine genome U74v2 DNA microarray. Hybridization data analysis revealed the upregulation of six sequences potentially coding for Mig. We confirmed post infection Mig mRNA increase by quantitative (qPCR) and RT-PCR. The presence of Mig in the supernatants of infected astrocytes was quantified using a specific ELISA. Secreted Mig was biologically active, inducing chemoattraction of mouse activated CD4(\u002B) T lymphocytes.

In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of no statistical significance. Moreover, 11 mammalian viral genera in minks were possibly identified for the first time through this study.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Yuan; Chen, Ji-Ming; Wang, Tong; Hou, Guang-Yu; Zhuang, Qing-Ye; Wu, Run; Wang, Kai-Cheng","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e73e4d8b9133c3dad7eee60e7ddeb295b233e4c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111271.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217302150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28501627/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217302150; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.05.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","viral megagenomics","classified viral families","mammalian viral genera","methods","random hybridization","sequencing libraries","pooled mink feces sample","mock sample","pooled duck feces sample","amplicons of random RT-PCR","ligation","generation sequencing","sequencing primers","study","random reverse transcription","RNA-Seq kit","viromes of RNA viruses","Personal Genome Machine platform","detection","polymerase chain reaction","single primer","Abstract Virome","differences","virology","minks","statistical significance","samples","optimization","laboratory","results","time"],"language":"en"},

Unlike most CoVs that antagonize type I interferon (IFN) production, previous studies showed that TGEV infection induces IFN-I production both in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that TGEV infection significantly facilitated IFN-\u03B2 production as well as activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03BAB) in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Screening of TGEV-encoded proteins demonstrated that non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) was the most potent IFN-\u03B2 inducer and induced IFN-\u03B2 production mainly by activating NF-\u03BAB but not IRF3. Further analysis showed that nsp14 interacted with DDX1, a member of the DExD/H helicase family. Knockdown of DDX1 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased nsp14-induced IFN-\u03B2 production and NF-\u03BAB activation. Furthermore, TGEV-induced IFN-\u03B2 production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were decreased in cells transfected with DDX1-specific siRNA, indicating the vital role of DDX1 to TGEV-induced IFN-\u03B2 responses. In summary, our data revealed a potential coactivator role of host RNA helicase DDX1 to the induction of IFN-\u03B2 response initiated by TGEV and demonstrated that nsp14 is an important IFN inducer among the TGEV-encoded proteins.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yanrong; Wu, Wei; Xie, Lilan; Wang, Dang; Ke, Qiyun; Hou, Zhenzhen; Wu, Xiaoli; Fang, Ying; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo; Fang, Liurong","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba1a34ae67fb2dcd9ad6cdf6d5b5e1fc32202839.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5552718.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28848548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","DExD/H"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-induced IFN-\u03B2 production","nsp14-induced IFN-\u03B2 production","induction of IFN","TGEV-induced IFN-\u03B2 responses","potent IFN-\u03B2 inducer","important IFN inducer","TGEV infection","IFN-stimulated gene","Screening of TGEV","TGEV-encoded proteins","transcription factors IFN regulatory factor","DDX1-specific siRNA","Knockdown of DDX1","vital role of DDX1","NF-\u03BAB activation","potential coactivator role of host RNA helicase DDX1","IRF3","cells","specific small interfering RNA","severe dehydration","porcine kidney","severe economic losses","nuclear factor-kappaB","H helicase family","piglets","lethal watery diarrhea","previous studies","DExD","ISG","member","interferon","enteropathogenic coronavirus","non-structural protein","swine industry","expression","data","PK","type","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","underlying mechanism","CoVs","summary","study","analysis"],"language":"en"},

FINDINGS: We show that bat DPP4 genes have been subject to significant adaptive evolution, suggestive of a long-term arms-race between bats and MERS related CoVs. In particular, we identify three positively selected residues in DPP4 that directly interact with the viral surface glycoprotein.

Conjunctival specimens were collected from 167 neonates for multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect 16 respiratory viruses, from 163 for polymerase chain reaction to detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and from 160 for bacterial culture studies. The cases were followed up until the age of 18 months. RESULTS: Viral conjunctivitis was diagnosed in 8/167 (4.8%; 95% CI 2.1\u20139.2%), chlamydial or gonococcal conjunctivitis in 0/163 cases (0%; 95% CI 0\u20132.2%) and other bacterial conjunctivitis in 58/160 (36%; 95% CI 29\u201344%).

The genomic analysis of complete transcriptomes, so-called meta-transcriptomics, is providing a particularly rich source of data on the global diversity of RNA viruses and their evolutionary history. Herein we review some of the insights that meta-transcriptomics has provided on the fundamental patterns and processes of virus evolution, with a focus on the recent discovery of a multitude of novel invertebrate viruses. In particular, meta-transcriptomics shows that the RNA virus world is more fluid than previously realized, with relatively frequent changes in genome length and structure. As well as having a transformative impact on studies of virus evolution, meta-transcriptomics presents major new challenges for virus classification, with the greater sampling of host taxa now filling many of the gaps on virus phylogenies that were previously used to define taxonomic groups. Given that most viruses in the future will likely be characterized using metagenomics approaches, and that we have evidently only sampled a tiny fraction of the total virosphere, we suggest that proposals for virus classification pay careful attention to the wonders unearthed in this new age of virus discovery.","publish_time":"2018-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Mang; Zhang, Yong-Zhen; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01c47a7e53b4cf4783d55125936061e2ca0d9817.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127328.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111455/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217305452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217305452; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.10.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus classification","virus phylogenies","studies of virus evolution","processes of virus evolution","study of virus evolution","RNA virus world","assemblage of virus genomes","new age of virus discovery","so-called meta-transcriptomics","global diversity of RNA viruses","recent discovery","multitude of novel invertebrate viruses","host sample","Abstract Metagenomics","metagenomics approaches","major new challenges","greater sampling of host taxa","proposals","fundamental patterns","genomic analysis of complete transcriptomes","wonders","careful attention","rich source of data","frequent changes","genome length","structure","total virosphere","transformative impact","focus","evolutionary history","tiny fraction","gaps","fluid","future","insights","taxonomic groups"],"language":"en"},

While most mathematical models for the virulence of infectious diseases focus on the interplay between the dynamics of host populations and the optimal characteristics for the success of the pathogen, our model focuses on how pathogen characteristics may change at the start of an epidemic, before the density of susceptible hosts decline. We envisage animal husbandry situations where hosts are at very high density and epidemics are curtailed before host densities are much reduced. The use of three pathogen characteristics: lethality, transmissibility and mutability allows us to investigate the interplay of these in relation to host density. We provide some numerical illustrations and discuss the effects of the size of the enclosure containing the host population on the encounter rate in our model that plays the key role in determining what pathogen type will eventually prevail. We also present a multistage extension of the model to situations where there are several populations and parasites can be transmitted from one of them to another. We conclude that animal husbandry situations with high stock densities will lead to very rapid increases in virulence, where virulent strains are either more transmissible or favoured by mutation. Further the process is affected by the nature of the farm enclosures.","publish_time":"2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borovkov, K.; Day, R.; Rice, T.","journal":"J Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9bab971b7a0cf9d130f86dcb439981f280e2276.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22461126/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-012-0526-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host densities","pathogen characteristics","dynamics of host populations","common host population","high density","pathogen type","animal husbandry situations","optimal characteristics","interplay","density of susceptible hosts","use","high stock densities","multitype continuous time Markov branching process model","spread of parasites","virulence of infectious diseases","rapid increases","lethality","virulent strains","effects","mutability","transmissibility","key role","encounter rate","success","epidemics","mathematical models","nature","size","start","multistage extension","farm enclosures","numerical illustrations","types","relation","mutation"],"language":"en"},

Influenza A viruses circulate in reservoir of wild aquatic birds, occasionally cause human pandemics, undergo antigenic drift and antigentic shift, and have been used as model viruses to understand many fundamental processes including receptor binding, membrane fusion, protein structure, and adaptive immunity. Influenza A and B viruses contain a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein, the dominant surface antigen that promotes receptor binding and membrane fusion during viral entry, and a neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein, a secondary antigen that has receptor-destroying activity necessary for virus release from infected cells. Influenza C viruses contain a single antigen, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein, which possesses receptor binding, membrane fusion, and virus release functions. The HA and HEF proteins are prototypic, trimeric, structural class I viral fusion proteins with a membrane-distal, immunodominant (and highly variable) receptor-binding head domain and a more highly conserved membrane-proximal, metastable, stalk domain that catalyzes membrane fusion. The tetrameric NA protein has a membrane-distal globular head domain with an antiparallel \u03B2-propeller topology and a membrane-proximal coiled-coil stalk. For the influenza A and B viruses, the HA protein is the predominant target for naturally acquired and vaccine-induced adaptive immunity. Recent structural studies of broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies bound to the HA protein, along with complementary immunological experiments, suggest ways to generate \u201Cuniversal\u201D influenza vaccines that are effective after antigenic drift and shift.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, C.J.","journal":"Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173616.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383957210; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383957210","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane fusion","influenza viruses","receptor binding","HA protein","Influenza C viruses","B viruses","conserved membrane-proximal","receptor-binding head domain","model viruses","influenza vaccines","viral fusion proteins","membrane-distal globular head domain","protein structure","membrane-proximal coiled-coil stalk","tetrameric NA protein","stalk domain","dominant surface antigen","single antigen","surface glycoprotein","secondary antigen","HEF proteins","antigenic drift","adaptive immunity","virus release functions","structural class","viral entry","hemagglutinin-esterase","antigentic shift","Recent structural studies","antiparallel \u03B2-propeller topology","reactive monoclonal antibodies","fundamental processes","human pandemics","activity necessary","reservoir of wild aquatic birds","ways","complementary immunological experiments","infected cells","neuraminidase","predominant target","thogotoviruses","immunodominant","orthomyxoviruses","isaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of ED adult patients before, during and after the SARS epidemic in a SARS-dedicated hospital. Methods A retrospective, ED chart review was conducted, and demographic data were obtained from a computer database, for a total of 17,586 patients. Patient information, including age, gender, mode of arrival, triage category, time of visit, main diagnosis, use of ED services, and status after the ED visit, were collected and compared for pre-, early-, peak-, late-, and post-SARS epidemic stages. Results Demographic data demonstrated a significant decrease in patient attendances per day, with a mean reduction of 92.5 \u00B1 8.3 patients (43.7 \u00B1 3.9% reduction in rate; p \u003C 0.01) during peak-versus pre-epidemic stages, but revealed no differences in patient age and gender. The numbers of patients with ambulance transport, inter-hospital referral, and critical illnesses, including DOA, categorized as triage 1, or admitted to a ward or intensive care unit after the ED visit, were not influenced by the SARS epidemic. The number of patients with upper airway infections and suicide attempts from drug overdoses increased, but not statistically significantly. The number of patients with other diagnoses decreased progressively from early- to peak-epidemic stages, but returned to their earlier levels at the post-epidemic stage. Statistically significant decreases (p \u003C 0.05) were noted in mean attendance at peak-versus pre- and early-epidemic stages for patients with cardiovascular disease, inflammatory or functional bowel disease, endocrine disease, dizziness or vertigo, or trauma. Conclusion The SARS outbreak did not eliminate the need of critically ill patients for advanced medical support. However, besides an overall decrease in patient numbers, the SARS epidemic markedly altered demographic information, clinical characteristics, and the use of medical services by adult patients in the ED of a SARS-dedicated hospital.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Chien-Cheng; Yen, David Hung-Tsang; Huang, Hsien-Hao; Kao, Wei-Fong; Wang, Lee-Min; Huang, Chun-I; Lee, Chen-Hsen","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a9acb16dde5abb907f6465bace23ff4e85c86f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490109701467; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490109701467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["numbers of patients","number of patients","ill patients","post-SARS epidemic stages","ED visit","SARS outbreak","pre-epidemic stages","clinical characteristics of ED adult patients","ED services","SARS-dedicated hospital","medical needs of adult patients","peak","post-epidemic stage","ED chart review","demographic data","demographic information","patient age","patient numbers","Patient information","patient attendances","use of medical services","endocrine disease","cardiovascular disease","gender","time of visit","mean reduction","functional bowel disease","inter-hospital referral","advanced medical support","triage category","overall decrease","significant decreases","mean attendance","upper airway infections","suicide attempts","dizziness","ambulance transport","day","severe acute respiratory syndrome","mode of arrival","main diagnosis","critical illnesses","intensive care unit","emergency department","differences","drug overdoses","earlier levels","impact","vertigo","Methods","retrospective","status","computer database","ward","total","trauma","study","rate","Conclusion","diagnoses","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Effective diagnosis and control measures are essential for the management of HPAIV infections. To develop a rapid diagnostic test, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against influenza virus A subtype H5 was generated. Eleven mAbs were produced and characterised according to their reactivity by indirect and sandwich ELISA and western blotting against different H5 subtypes representing past and viruses currently circulating. Ten out of 11 mAbs reacted strongly with the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of H5 viruses, whereas one mAb reacted with the M1 protein. Targeted HA protein epitopes seemed to be conformational. One hybridoma clone binds to a linear epitope of the M1 protein. One specific mAb reacts with HPAIV H5 in the immunofluorescence test, and two antibodies neutralised H5 viruses. On the basis of the results, the set of seven mAbs is appropriate for developing diagnostic tests. With the generated mAbs, a sandwich ELISA was developed recognising all H5N1 strains tested but no other influenza viruses. With this ELISA, as little as 0.005 HA units or 0.1 ng/ml H5N1 was detected, surpassing other ELISA tests. The novel reagents have the potential to improve significantly available rapid antigen detection systems.","publish_time":"2011-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linke, Sonja; Neubauer, Katrin; Dorner, Martin B.; Dorner, Brigitte G.; Pauli, Georg; Schweiger, Brunhilde","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ea1ce24a43fd670f233b2e0d0bc4a84d2658736.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549148/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.04.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411001637; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411001637","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAIV"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["protein of H5 viruses","HPAIV H5","influenza viruses","generated mAbs","antibodies neutralised H5 viruses","sandwich ELISA","ELISA tests","M1 protein","subtype H5N1","different H5 subtypes","Targeted HA protein epitopes","rapid diagnostic test","poultry","HA units","H5N1 strains","diagnostic tests","pathogenic avian influenza","management of HPAIV infections","immunofluorescence test","specific mAb","panel of murine monoclonal antibodies","available rapid antigen detection systems","western blotting","control measures","potential","transmission","linear epitope","Effective diagnosis","humans","set","haemagglutinin","hybridoma clone","southeast Asia","large outbreaks","emergence","results","reactivity","novel reagents","basis","European countries"],"language":"en"},

However, DNA vaccines suffer from limited immunogenicity and thus strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency are needed. We have previously demonstrated that for DNA vaccines encoding HPV-16 E7 antigen (CRT/E7) linkage with calreticulin (CRT) linked enhances both the E7-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell immune responses and antitumor effects against E7-expressing tumors. In the current study, we aim to introduce an approach to elicit potent CD4(\u002B) T cell help for the enhancement of antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination by using co-administration of a DNA vector expressing papillomavirus major and minor capsid antigens, L1 and L2. RESULT: We showed that co-administration of vectors containing codon-optimized bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) L1 and L2 in combination with DNA vaccines could elicit enhanced antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) in both CRT/E7 and ovalbumin (OVA) antigenic systems. We also demonstrated that co-administration of vectors expressing BPV-1 L1 and/or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1/L2-specific CD4(\u002B) T cell immune responses and L1-specific neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we showed that co-administration with DNA encoding BPV1 L1 significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. In addition, the observed enhancement of CD8(\u002B) T cell immune responses by DNA encoding L1 and L2 was also found to extend to HPV-16 L1/L2 system. CONCLUSION: Our strategy elicits both potent neutralizing antibody and therapeutic responses and may potentially be extended to other antigenic systems beyond papillomavirus for the control of infection and/or cancer.","publish_time":"2015-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Benjamin; Yang, Andrew; Peng, Shiwen; Pang, Xiaowu; Roden, Richard B.S.; Wu, T.-C.; Hung, Chien-Fu","journal":"Cell Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44d9ad484dc917e82daa41c802c2157d3f20dda4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4480891.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-015-0025-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26113972/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRT","CRT/E7 DNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["L2 DNA","DNA vaccines","E7 DNA vaccination","DNA vector","CRT","E7-specific CD8","E7 antigen","T cell immune responses","DNA vaccine potency","BPV1 L1","generation of L1","L2-specific CD4","L1-specific neutralizing antibodies","T cell help","therapeutic responses","L2 system","co-administration of vectors","enhanced antigen-specific CD8","HPV","papillomavirus major","enhancement of antigen","control of human papillomavirus","observed enhancement of CD8","therapeutic antitumor effects","bovine papillomavirus type","potent CD4","antigenic systems","potent neutralizing antibody","control of infection","minor capsid antigens","codon","attractive candidates","strategies","ovalbumin","linkage","combination","limited immunogenicity","strategy","calreticulin","associated malignancies","addition","tumors","cancer","CONCLUSION","approach","RESULT","BACKGROUND","current study"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to summarize available data on severity differences in acute cardiac injury and acute cardiac injury with mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search across Pubmed, Embase and pre-print from December 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, to identify all observational studies that reported cardiac specific biomarkers (troponin, creatine kinase\u2013MB fraction, myoglobin, or NT-proBNP) during COVID-19 infection. We extracted data on patient demographics, infection severity, comorbidity history, and biomarkers during COVID-19 infection. Where possible, data were pooled for meta-analysis with standard (SMD) or weighted (WMD) mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 4189 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients from 28 studies. More severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher mean troponin (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.75, p \u003C 0.001), with a similar trend for creatine kinase\u2013MB, myoglobin, and NT-proBNP. Acute cardiac injury was more frequent in those with severe, compared to milder, disease (risk ratio 5.99, 3.04 to 11.80; p \u003C 0.001). Meta regression suggested that cardiac injury biomarker differences of severity are related to history of hypertension (p = 0.030). Also COVID19-related cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality (summary risk ratio 3.85, 2.13 to 6.96; p \u003C 0.001). hsTnI and NT-proBNP levels increased during the course of hospitalization only in non-survivors. CONCLUSION: The severity of COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury, and acute cardiac injury is associated with death. Cardiac injury biomarkers mainly increase in non-survivors. This highlights the need to effectively monitor heart health to prevent myocarditis in patients infected with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jing-Wei; Han, Tian-Wen; Woodward, Mark; Anderson, Craig S.; Zhou, Hao; Chen, Yun-Dai; Neal, Bruce","journal":"Prog Cardiovasc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dc4e491aacc2c606aed389e9c8382ac190ad3b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7160645.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2020.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305557/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062020300803?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033062020300803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute cardiac injury","Cardiac injury biomarkers","severity of COVID","COVID19-related cardiac injury","cardiac injury biomarker differences of severity","severe COVID","cardiac specific biomarkers","confirmed COVID","infection severity","severity differences","NT-proBNP levels","creatine kinase","higher mortality","myoglobin","SMD","higher mean troponin","available data","non-survivors","infected patients","summary risk ratio","MB fraction","comorbidity history","history of hypertension","observational studies","patient demographics","systematic literature search","Pubmed","Embase","meta-analysis","course of hospitalization","Meta regression","heart health","confidence intervals","WMD","standard","disease","similar trend","myocarditis","pre-print","hsTnI","Evidence","death","need","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","outbreak","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Recommendations Every effort should be made to deliver safe ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention. Integrating research programs that evaluate the utility of these approaches may provide important insights into how to develop more optimal approaches to secondary prevention beyond the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholls, Stephen J.; Nelson, Mark; Astley, Carolyn; Briffa, Tom; Brown, Alex; Clark, Robyn; Colquhoun, David; Gallagher, Robyn; Hare, David L.; Inglis, Sally; Jelinek, Michael; O\u2019Neil, Adrienne; Tirimacco, Rosy; Vale, Margarite; Redfern, Julie","journal":"Heart Lung Circ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e565f22defc22187c3e7eec110b87b4d8b5110c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950620301359; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950620301359?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.04.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Position Statement","CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","health care professionals","mental health","use of secondary prevention measures","patients","delivery of routine health care","COVID","standard health services","effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies","range of electronic health platforms","prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events","CVD","potential","impact","challenges","use of evidenced based therapies","established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease","coronavirus disease","optimal approaches","safe ongoing access","medications","imaging","implications","blood tests","individuals","treatment guidelines","major disruption","lifestyle habits","attendance","utility","limitations","Abstract Background","Position Statement","important insights","ability of practitioners","world","cardiac rehabilitation","aim","research programs","effort","increase","Recommendations","addition"],"language":"en"},

Using biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses we found that M consists of a short glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain, three transmembrane segments and a long, immunogenic C-terminal endodomain. Although the N-glycosylation site of M seems to be highly conserved between group 1 and 3 coronaviruses, studies using a recombinant SARS-CoV expressing a glycosylation-deficient M revealed that N-glycosylation of M neither influence the shape of the virions nor their infectivity in cell culture.

For JEV and some other flaviviruses, oronasal transmission is described, but the mode of infection is unknown. Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells (NEC) at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs. Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines, indicating infection and replication in macrophages. Moreover, macrophages stimulated by alarmins, including interleukin-25, interleukin-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, were more permissive to the JEV infection. Altogether, our data are important to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs. IMPORTANCE JEV, a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans, has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito-waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs, which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes, leading to increased human cases. JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors. Moreover, virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium. Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three-dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus. Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages, which is favored by epithelial-cell-derived cytokines.

There is currently no specific medication for EV71 infection. Quercetin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in plants, has been demonstrated to inhibit various viral infections. However, investigation of the anti-EV71 mechanism has not been reported to date. METHODS: The anti-EV71 activity of quercetin was evaluated by phenotype screening, determining the cytopathic effect (CPE) and EV71-induced cells apoptosis. The effects on EV71 replication were evaluated further by determining virus yield, viral RNA synthesis and protein expression, respectively. The mechanism of action against EV71 was determined from the effective stage and time-of-addition assays. The possible inhibitory functions of quercetin via viral 2Apro, 3C(pro) or 3D(pol) were tested. The interaction between EV71 3C(pro) and quercetin was predicted and calculated by molecular docking. RESULTS: Quercetin inhibited EV71-mediated cytopathogenic effects, reduced EV71 progeny yields, and prevented EV71-induced apoptosis with low cytotoxicity. Investigation of the underlying mechanism of action revealed that quercetin exhibited a preventive effect against EV71 infection and inhibited viral adsorption. Moreover, quercetin mediated its powerful therapeutic effects primarily by blocking the early post-attachment stage of viral infection. Further experiments demonstrated that quercetin potently inhibited the activity of the EV71 protease, 3C(pro), blocking viral replication, but not the activity of the protease, 2A(pro), or the RNA polymerase, 3D(pol). Modeling of the molecular binding of the 3C(pro)-quercetin complex revealed that quercetin was predicted to insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3C(pro), blocking substrate recognition and thereby inhibiting EV71 3C(pro) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin can effectively prevent EV71-induced cell injury with low toxicity to host cells. Quercetin may act in more than one way to deter viral infection, exhibiting some preventive and a powerful therapeutic effect against EV71. Further, quercetin potently inhibits EV71 3C(pro) activity, thereby blocking EV71 replication.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Chenguang; Xi, Caili; Hu, Kanghong; Gao, Wa; Cai, Xiaofeng; Qin, Jinlan; Lv, Shiyun; Du, Canghao; Wei, Yanhong","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/412aab9232d9b674c8ba7519a3c85ae72c2f0b9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6069798.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1023-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Quercetin inhibited EV71","EV71 infection","EV71 replication","EV71 protease","anti-EV71 activity of quercetin","EV71-induced apoptosis","anti-EV71 mechanism","quercetin complex","EV71-induced cells apoptosis","EV71-induced cell injury","substrate-binding pocket of EV71","reduced EV71 progeny yields","viral replication","viral adsorption","possible inhibitory functions of quercetin","viral RNA synthesis","various viral infections","early post-attachment stage of viral infection","preventive effect","powerful therapeutic effects","cytopathogenic effects","cytopathic effect","underlying mechanism of action","molecular binding","investigation","low toxicity","RNA polymerase","low cytotoxicity","mouth disease","effective stage","substrate recognition","molecular docking","severe central nervous system disease","foot","children","virus yield","major causative agents of hand","CPE","Apro","protein expression","phenotype screening","time","HFMD","specific medication","METHODS","RESULTS","interaction","addition assays","distributed flavonoids","plants","Modeling","BACKGROUND","Enterovirus","way","CONCLUSIONS","date","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and \u201Cwhirlpool-like\u201D formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points.

These studies were designed to examine the changes in the function of the bladder that may underlie neurogenic bladder dysfunction using a mouse model of demyelination in the CNS. METHODS: Bladders from 12 week old male C57BL/6J mice with coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE, a chronic, progressive demyelinating disease model of human MS), and age-matched controls, were cut into 5\u20137 strips and suspended in physiological muscle baths for tension measurement in response to agonists and electric field stimulation (EFS). Experiments were performed on intact and denuded (with mucosa removed) bladder strips. RESULTS: The maximum effect of EFS was not significantly different between CIE and control bladders. Nerve-evoked EFS contractions (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) were blocked by a combination of atropine (cholinergic antagonist) and \u03B1,\u03B2-methylene ATP (an ATP analog that desensitizes purinergic receptors). In response to EFS, the \u03B1,\u03B2-methylene ATP-resistant (cholinergic) component of contraction was significantly reduced, while the atropine-resistant (purinergic) component was significantly increased in CIE bladders. Removal of the mucosa in CIE bladders restored the cholinergic component. Bethanechol (muscarinic receptor agonist) potency was significantly increased in CIE bladders. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a deficit in the nerve-evoked cholinergic component of contraction that is not due to the ability of the smooth muscle to respond to acetylcholine. We conclude that neurodegenerative bladder dysfunction in this model of multiple sclerosis may be due, in part, to pathologic changes in the mucosa that causes suppression of muscarinic receptor-mediated contractile response and augmentation of purinergic response of the underlying muscle. Further studies utilizing CIE mice should help elucidate the pathological changes in the mucosa resulting from demyelination in the CNS.","publish_time":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamarre, Neil S.; Braverman, Alan S.; Malykhina, Anna P.; Barbe, Mary F.; Ruggieri, Michael R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4195612.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","EFS","CIE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CIE bladders","mucosa","CIE mice","bladder strips","control bladders","nerve-evoked cholinergic component of contraction","augmentation of purinergic response","neurodegenerative bladder dysfunction","contractile response","cholinergic antagonist","model of multiple sclerosis","neurogenic bladder dysfunction","\u03B2-methylene ATP-resistant","Nerve-evoked EFS contractions","ATP analog","mouse model of demyelination","maximum effect of EFS","underlying muscle","atropine-resistant","smooth muscle","purinergic receptors","pathological changes","pathologic changes","CNS","studies","suppression of muscarinic receptor","physiological muscle baths","muscarinic receptor agonist","urinary frequency","J mice","neurodegenerative diseases","combination of atropine","progressive demyelinating disease model of human MS","lower urinary tract symptoms","LUTS","Alzheimer\u2019s","agonists","week old male C57BL","tension measurement","coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis","potency","electric field stimulation","damage","nocturia","urgency","Parkinson\u2019s","tetrodotoxin-sensitive","deficit","retention","Patients","Bethanechol","central nervous systems","age-matched controls","data","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","Removal","Experiments","CONCLUSIONS","ability","acetylcholine"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment.

This review focuses on the innate interferon-mediated host response to respiratory viruses and discusses and summarizes the available evidence that this response is impaired or suboptimal. In addition, the ability of respiratory viruses to act in a synergistic or additive manner with TH2 pathways will be discussed. In this review we argue that these 2 outcomes are likely linked and discuss the available evidence that shows reciprocal negative regulation between innate interferons and TH2 mediators.

METHODS: A 2-year prospective study was conducted on infants with a first episode of bronchiolitis admitted to Respiratory Department of Suzhou Children\u0027s Hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics and meteorological conditions were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 59.6% of 998 cases analyzed. The most frequent pathogen identified was respiratory syncytial virus (28.7%), followed by human bocavirus (11.6%), MP (9.0%), human parainfluenza virus-3 (7.8%), human metapneumovirus (6.6%), influenza A (3.5%), adenovirus (1.0%), and human parainfluenza virus-1 (0.3%). The clinical scores in children with MP or human metapneumovirus single infections, based on the assessment of severity of acute bronchiolitis, were significantly lower than in children with respiratory syncytial virus single infections. Respiratory syncytial virus had the strongest inverse correlation with mean temperature, followed by influenza A and human metapneumovirus. In addition, MP and human parainfluenza virus-3 showed positive correlations with mean temperature. CONCLUSION: Although respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequent pathogen in patients in whom bronchiolitis was diagnosed, other pathogens, including newly identified viruses and MP, also play important roles in infants with bronchiolitis. Different respiratory pathogens have different traits in response to certain meteorological conditions.","publish_time":"2013-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zheng-Rong; Ji, Wei; Wang, Yu-Qing; Yan, Yong-Dong; Shao, Xue-Jun; Zhang, Xue-Lan; Xu, Jun","journal":"J Formos Med Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cd18202a1ae525d8bf2feecfe790f34c16fe1d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961189/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2012.12.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664613000260; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664613000260","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human parainfluenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus single infections","acute bronchiolitis","human bocavirus","Different respiratory pathogens","episode of bronchiolitis","human metapneumovirus single infections","identified viruses","certain meteorological conditions","Respiratory Department of Suzhou Children\u0027s Hospital","hospitalized infants","frequent pathogen","mean temperature","different traits","clinical characteristics","clinical scores","prevalence of common viruses","year prospective study","response","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","strongest inverse correlation","positive correlations","relationship","important roles","assessment of severity","addition","patients","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","cases","adenovirus"],"language":"en"},

Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) have been re-occurring every year since the first onset in 2013 with substantial losses across the hog production supply chain. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in PEDv incidence is visible. We assert that changes in human behaviors may underlie this trend. Disease prevention using biosecurity practices is used to minimize risk of infection but its efficacy is conditional on human behavior and risk attitude. Standard epidemiological models bring important insights into disease dynamics but have limited predictive ability. Since research shows that human behavior plays a driving role in the disease spread process, the explicit inclusion of human behavior into models adds an important dimension to understanding disease spread. Here we analyze PEDv incidence emerging from an agent-based model (ABM) that uses both epidemiological dynamics and algorithms that incorporate heterogeneous human decisions. We investigate the effects of shifting fractions of hog producers between risk tolerant and risk averse positions. These shifts affect the dynamics describing willingness to increase biosecurity as a response to disease threats and, indirectly, change infection probabilities and the resultant intensity and impact of the disease outbreak. Our ABM generates empirically verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission. Scenario results show that relatively small shifts (10% of the producer agents) toward a risk averse position can lead to a significant decrease in total incidence. For significantly steeper decreases in disease incidence, the model\u0027s hog producer population needed at least 37.5% of risk averse. Our study provides insight into the link between risk attitude, decisions related to biosecurity, and consequent spread of disease within a livestock production system. We suggest that it is possible to create positive, lasting changes in animal health by nudging the population of livestock producers toward more risk averse behaviors. We make a case for integrating social and epidemiological aspects in disease spread models to test intervention strategies intended to improve biosecurity and animal health at the system scale.","publish_time":"2019-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bucini, Gabriela; Merrill, Scott C.; Clark, Eric; Moegenburg, Susan M.; Zia, Asim; Koliba, Christopher J.; Wiltshire, Serge; Trinity, Luke; Smith, Julia M.","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b76a747ec773a8604c95aa082bbb51fd95af353.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1582cbf653a14f9033c7a33567909f54e736ba6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6604760.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease incidence","disease spread","disease dynamics","disease threats","disease outbreak","Disease prevention","risk attitude","risk of infection","risk averse behaviors","consequent spread of disease","risk tolerant","risk averse positions","PEDv incidence","human behaviors","epidemiological dynamics","heterogeneous human decisions","explicit inclusion of human behavior","biosecurity practices","total incidence","Standard epidemiological models","model\u0027s hog producer population","Hog producers\u0027 operational decisions","population of livestock producers","animal health","hog production supply chain","epidemiological aspects","livestock production system","ABM","effects of shifting fractions of hog producers","verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission","important insights","important dimension","producer agents","lasting changes","infection probabilities","system scale","decreasing trend","small shifts","process","substantial losses","resultant intensity","Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","impact","link","driving role","algorithms","efficacy","significant decrease","intervention strategies","agent-based model","willingness","response","awareness of risks","steeper decreases","endemic diseases","onset","Scenario results","case","predictive ability","year","study","research"],"language":"en"},

However, the clinical relevance of picornavirus detection by PCR is unclear. Immunofluorescence (IF), widely used to detect other respiratory viruses, has recently been introduced as a promising detection method for respiratory picornaviruses. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical manifestations of respiratory picornavirus infections detected by IF with those of respiratory picornavirus infections detected by xTAG multiplex PCR in hospitalized children. STUDY DESIGN: During a 1-year period, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from all children hospitalized due to an acute respiratory infection were prospectively analyzed by IF. All respiratory picornavirus positive IF samples and 100 IF negative samples were further tested with xTAG multiplex PCR. After exclusion of children with co-morbidities and viral co-infections, monoinfections with respiratory picornaviruses were detected in 108 NPA of 108 otherwise healthy children by IF and/or PCR. We compared group 1 children (IF and PCR positive, n = 84) with group 2 children (IF negative and PCR positive, n = 24) with regard to clinical manifestations of the infection. RESULTS: Wheezy bronchitis was diagnosed more often in group 1 than in group 2 (71% vs. 46%, p = 0.028). In contrast, group 2 patients were diagnosed more frequently with pneumonia (17% vs. 6%, p = 0.014) accompanied by higher levels of C-reactive protein (46 mg/l vs. 11 mg/l, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Picornavirus detection by IF in children with acute respiratory infection is associated with the clinical presentation of wheezy bronchitis. The finding of a more frequent diagnosis of pneumonia in picornavirus PCR positive but IF negative children warrants further investigation.","publish_time":"2010-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schindera, Christina; Kraemer, Ann Lea; Regamey, Nicolas; Aebi, Christoph; Gorgievski-Hrisoho, Meri; Barbani, Maria Teresa","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3870957af6801f7328dbb8dbfcccc045f4fd1e42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172693.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210001733; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.04.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210001733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory picornavirus positive","picornavirus PCR positive","negative children","detection of respiratory picornaviruses","hospitalized children","respiratory viruses","group","clinical manifestations of respiratory picornavirus infections","acute respiratory infection","exclusion of children","healthy children","xTAG multiplex PCR","clinical relevance of picornavirus detection","negative samples","clinical presentation of wheezy bronchitis","viral co-infections","NPA","promising detection method","co-morbidities","frequent diagnosis of pneumonia","monoinfections","sensitive tool","year period","nasopharyngeal aspirates","higher levels of C","Polymerase chain reaction","reactive protein","BACKGROUND","regard","patients","finding","RESULTS","contrast","OBJECTIVES","investigation","CONCLUSIONS","STUDY DESIGN","Immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

Although they share common structural features with the other Tombusviridae viruses in their virions and the terminal structure of the genomic RNAs, the bipartite nature of the dianthovirus genome offers an ideal experimental system with which to study basic issues of virology. The two genomic RNAs seem to use distinct strategies to regulate their translation, transcription, genome replication, genome packaging, and cell-to-cell movement during infection. This review summarizes the current state of our knowledge of the dianthoviruses, with its main emphasis on the molecular biology of the virus, including the viral and host factors required for its infection of host plants.

The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era. However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs. In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage. The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms.","publish_time":"2018-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ubah, Obinna; Palliyil, Soumya","journal":"Recombinant Antibodies for Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120432.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549637/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-72077-7_6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phage display libraries","unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases","numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases","high affinity","isolation of high","diagnostic biologics","affinity antibodies","diagnostic tools","antigenic targets of infectious organisms","animal immunisation","surface of filamentous phage","knowledge of antibody engineering","protein libraries","biologic drugs","preventive drugs","therapeutic applications","powerful combinatorial technology","molecular diversity technology","selection of binding fragments","routine isolation of invaluable peptides","efficacy","limited off-site toxicity","association","severe acute respiratory syndrome","presentation of large peptide","SARS","AIDS","toxic treatment","platforms","domains","preferred route","poorer countries","HIV","crucial role","rise","modern era","great precision","global threat","advances","diagnostics","therapeutics","vaccines","aging population","Morbidity","mortality","benefits","recent H1N1 influenza","time consuming","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Based on previous studies of neuroinvasive human respiratory coronaviruses, it is proposed that after physical contact with the nasal mucosa, laryngopharynx, trachea, lower respiratory tract, alveoli epithelium, or gastrointestinal mucosa, SARS-CoV-2 can induce intrinsic and innate immune responses in the host involving increased cytokine release, tissue damage, and high neurosusceptibility to COVID-19, especially in the hypoxic conditions caused by lung injury. In some immune-compromised individuals, the virus may invade the brain through multiple routes, such as the vasculature and peripheral nerves.

The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia, the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle, prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012\u20132016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015\u20132016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R(0)) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1\u2264R(0)\u22642,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible. These results indicate public health agencies should be aware that measures for strict containment are urgently needed before new epidemics take off in the region.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sardar, Tridip; Ghosh, Indrajit; Rod\u00F3, Xavier; Chattopadhyay, Joydev","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7046297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32059047/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008065","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV cases","number of cases","total number of MERS","highest number of MERS","CoV clinical cases","future MERS-CoV peak week","epidemic cycle","epidemic form","strain models","basic reproduction number","containment measures","peak of seasonal incidence","epidemiological cycle","Macca","mathematical models of disease epidemiology","high epidemic risk","Riyadh","different disease incidence functions","best model combination","strict containment","key epidemiological information","severe acute respiratory illness","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","social behavior","case fatality rate","response","Saudi-Arabia","overall shape","Non-monotone","infection","Madina","feature","prevention","public health agencies","major worldwide hotspot","incomplete understanding","alleged co-circulation","past outbreaks","new epidemics","Accurate predictions","effective treatment","vaccine","results","interval","CFR","variability","evolution","absence","region"],"language":"en"},

Controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies. Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators, referred to as eicosanoids, play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a cell death (\u201Cdebris\u201D)-induced \u201Ceicosanoid storm\u201D, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response. A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins. Resolvins and other SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris and counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a process called inflammation resolution. SPMs and their lipid precursors exhibit anti-viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive. SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm. Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection. Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation. While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on \u201Canti-viral\u201D and \u201Canti-inflammatory\u201D strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression. Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panigrahy, Dipak; Gilligan, Molly M.; Huang, Sui; Gartung, Allison; Cort\u00E9s-Puch, Irene; Sime, Patricia J.; Phipps, Richard P.; Serhan, Charles N.; Hammock, Bruce D.","journal":"Cancer Metastasis Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eac1fb5c5fb0a27c858d7fa25fcfbb000b29d079.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385712/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10555-020-09889-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Resolvins"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resolution of inflammation","inflammation resolution","SPMs","production of pro-resolution mediators","induction of inflammation","robust viral-induced inflammation","treatment of COVID","management of COVID","anti-viral activity","counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production","anti-viral therapies","inflammatory cytokine suppression","current anti-viral strategies","inflammatory diseases","pulmonary hyper-inflammation","robust inflammatory response","key pathology of COVID","anti-viral B cell antibodies","sEH inhibitors","cytokine storms","systemic inflammatory response","resolvins","Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators","debris clearance","discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators","lipid precursors","clinical trials","EETs","macrophage-mediated clearance of debris","lymphocyte activity","potential complement","potential use","anti-inflammatory processes","life-threatening complications","cell death","eicosanoid storm","active biochemical process","novel host-centric therapeutic avenue","nanogram doses","arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids","ARDS","pathological thrombosis","turn","setting of influenza","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Soluble epoxide hydrolase","prostaglandins","critical role","eicosanoids","understanding","clot removal","leukotrienes","Severe coronavirus disease","infection","paradigm shift","SARS-CoV"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: Patients hospitalized between 3 months and 16 years of age were included in a 1\u2010year prospective, observational, cross\u2010sectional study. Respiratory secretions were collected and the presence of different viruses and atypical bacteria analyzed by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Two hundred nine patients (118 females) aged (mean \u00B1 SD) 4.4 \u00B1 4 years were included. A potential causative agent was detected in 78% of the patients. The most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (n = 85; 40%) and rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 52; 24.5%); M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were detected in 4.5% and 2% of the cases, respectively. Patients with HRSV (vs. HRV) were hospitalized for a longer time (6.7 vs. 5.2 days, P = 0.012), required more days of oxygen supply (5.1 vs. 3.4, P = 0.005), had a longer duration of the exacerbation before hospitalization (3.6 vs. 1.9 days, P = 0.001) and were younger (3.7 vs. 5.1 years, P = 0.012). Three peaks of admissions were observed. A first peak (early autumn) caused by HRV, a second peak (winter) caused mainly by HRSV and a third one (spring), caused by HRSV, an increase in HMPV together with a second outbreak of HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an acute asthma exacerbation presented a high prevalence of respiratory viruses. Most hospitalizations corresponded to seasonal increases in prevalence of HRV and HRSV.

We discuss the potential impact of timing of anti-cytokine therapy on viral clearance and the impact of such therapy on intra-pulmonary macrophage activation and emergent pulmonary vascular disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGonagle, Dennis; Sharif, Kassem; O\u0027Regan, Anthony; Bridgewood, Charlie","journal":"Autoimmun Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f802cf53d6a85e950807093d4eeb11510d92762f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195002.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32251717/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH","MAS","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classification of MAS","anti-cytokine therapy","Severe COVID","intra-pulmonary macrophage activation","different therapy strategies","associated pneumonia patients","complexities of discerning ARDS","umbrella term of macrophage activation syndrome","cytokine storm","primary HLH","sustained IL","potential impact of timing","emergent pulmonary vascular disease","adult respiratory distress syndrome","subjects","viral clearance","features of systemic hyper-inflammation","immunodeficiency states","secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis","non-survival","sHLH","situations","infection","presentation","model","elevation"],"language":"en"},

Although considerable research has been conducted on source localization in steady-state indoor environments, very few studies have dealt with the more challenging source localization problems in dynamic indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive particle swarm optimization (CPSO) method to locate a contaminant source in dynamic indoor environments with mechanical ventilation and develops a multi-robot source localization system to experimentally validate the method. Three robots were used to test the presented method in a typical dynamic indoor environment with periodic swinging of the air supply louvers of a cabinet air conditioner. The presented method was validated with two typical source locations, DS (in the downwind zone) and RS (in the recirculation zone). For DS and RS, 15 and 14 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 100% and 93.3%, and each robot moved an average of 24.4 and 23.6 steps, respectively. The presented method was also compared with the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO) and wind utilization II (WUII) methods for locating the source at DS. For the SPSO and WUII methods, only 3 and 6 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 20% and 40% and averages of 33.0 and 38.0 steps, respectively. The experimental results show that the presented method not only has a much higher success rate than the SPSO and WUII methods but also has higher source localization efficiency.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Qilin; Cai, Hao; Chen, Zhilong; Yang, Yibin; Lu, Jingyu; Li, Fei; Xu, Jiheng; Li, Xianting","journal":"Energy and Buildings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a080640d17fb8db7f8bf5b0eebb8cf24c8396aae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288120/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.03.032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778819303263; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778819303263","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPSO","WUII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presented method","Abstract Source localization","contaminant source","higher source localization efficiency","experiments","challenging source localization problems","dynamic indoor environments","typical source locations","multi-robot source localization system","indoor air quality","SPSO","WUII methods","typical dynamic indoor environment","steady-state indoor environments","success rates","higher success rate","steps","comprehensive particle swarm optimization","standard particle swarm optimization","air supply louvers","cabinet air conditioner","downwind zone","recirculation zone","periodic swinging","mechanical ventilation","CPSO","wind utilization","paper","environmental safety","studies","experimental results","considerable research","averages","robots"],"language":"en"},

In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur \u2018in person\u2019, \u2018by other appropriate means\u2019, or even, \u2018due to the exigencies of the public health emergency\u2019, not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that \u2018the exigencies of the public health emergency\u2019 might hamper the independent psychiatrist\u0027s work and requires a written report from the patient\u0027s treating psychiatrist \u2018no earlier than the day before\u2019 the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals \u2018consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor\u2019. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise \u2018necessary in the interest of the patient\u2019. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days \u2018of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary\u2019. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide \u2018a written statement\u2019 rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice.

Specific vaccination guidelines recommend reimmunisation after HSCT but data regarding vaccine efficacy in this unique population are scarce. New immune functional assays could enable prediction of vaccine response in the setting of HSCT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective, longitudinal single-centre cohort study of autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients was designed in order to determine the vaccine response to five vaccine targets (pneumococcus, hepatitis B virus, Haemophilus Influenzae type b, tetanus and diphtheria) and to correlate it to immune function parameters. A workflow was set up to study serological response to vaccines and to describe the functional immune status of 100 HSCT recipients (50 autologous and 50 allogeneic) before and 3, 12 and 24 months after primary immunisation. At each time point, \u2018basic\u2019 immune status recording (serology, immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry) will be assessed. The immune response will furthermore be evaluated before and 3 months after primary vaccination by two ex vivo immune functional assays assessing: (1) tumour necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma production and host messenger RNA expression on whole-blood stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B and (2) T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to a standard mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin) or to selected recall antigens. Reference intervals will be determined from a cohort of 30 healthy volunteers. This translational study will provide data describing vaccine response, immune functionality of HSCT recipients over time and will allow mapping HSCT recipients with regard to their immune function. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the institutional review board (no 69HCL17_0769). Results will be communicated at scientific meetings and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

This process can be triggered by nutrient deprivation, microbial infections or other challenges to promote cell survival under these stressed conditions. However, basal levels of autophagy are also crucial for the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis by ensuring the selective removal of protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles. A tight regulation of this process is essential for cellular survival and organismal health. Indeed, deregulation of autophagy is associated with a broad range of pathologies such as neuronal degeneration, inflammatory diseases, and cancer progression. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of autophagy substrates, as well as components of the autophagic machinery, are critical regulatory mechanisms of autophagy. Here, we review the main evidence implicating deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in the regulation of autophagy. We also discuss how they may constitute new therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of pathologies such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases or infections.","publish_time":"2018-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacomin, Anne-Claire; Taillebourg, Emmanuel; Fauvarque, Marie-Odile","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6116007.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells7080112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deregulation of autophagy","deubiquitination of autophagy substrates","basal levels of autophagy","critical regulatory mechanisms of autophagy","cellular survival","treatment of pathologies","inflammatory diseases","cell survival","neurodegenerative diseases","evolutionary conserved catabolic process","microbial infections","tight regulation","broad range of pathologies","degradation of intracellular components","maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis","selective removal of protein aggregates","neuronal degeneration","DUBs","autophagic machinery","challenges","cancers","dysfunctional organelles","deubiquitinating enzymes","nutrient deprivation","main evidence","organismal health","new therapeutic opportunities","cancer progression","lysosomes","stressed conditions"],"language":"en"},

However, its use is hindered by definitional ambiguity, and the conceptual bases underpinning its application remain weak. This is exemplified by two different but equally valid interpretations of UES: \u201Curban ecosystem services\u201D, referring to ecosystem services from analogs of natural and semi-natural ecosystems within urban boundaries, and \u201Curban ecosystem services\u201D, a much broader term that includes the former group as well as urban services in a city. While we recognize that a single definition of UES is not possible nor necessary as its application is context-dependent, it is nevertheless useful to clarify the relationships between these interpretations to promote consistent use, and importantly, explore how a broader interpretation of UES might advance its applications in areas that have been neglected. We developed a conceptual framework that links UES to natural and human-derived capital to explain the relationships between the dual meanings of UES and proposed three normative propositions to guide its application: (1) integrate holistically multiple components of natural capital to provide UES, (2) reduce dependence on non-renewable abiotic resources and human-derived capital, and (3) enhance UES through technology. The framework we developed helps to resolve the current ambiguity in the meanings of UES, highlights the need to recognise neglected aspects of natural capital important for UES, and can be used to clarify relationships with related concepts conveying dependence of human well-being on nature.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yok tan, Puay; Zhang, Jingyuan; Masoudi, Mahyar; Berhane Alemu, Jahson; Edwards, Peter J.; Gr\u00EAt-Regamey, Adrienne; Richards, Daniel R.; Saunders, Justine; Ping Song, Xiao; Wei Wong, Lynn","journal":"Landsc Urban Plan","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3353f6e12359de087dd6fed629cee39c56d3c38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183943.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920461931254X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103837; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016920461931254X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urban services","urban ecosystem services","valid interpretations of UES","dual meanings of UES","broader interpretation of UES","urban boundaries","urban sustainability","single definition of UES","Abstract Urban ecosystem service","analogs of natural","management of urban landscapes","human-derived capital","relationships","multiple components of natural capital","neglected aspects of natural capital important","semi-natural ecosystems","dependence of human well-being","conceptual framework","conceptual bases","definitional ambiguity","current ambiguity","broader term","consistent use","non-renewable abiotic resources","design","related concepts","need","planning","group","influential concept","normative propositions","context-dependent","nature","applications","areas","city","technology"],"language":"en"},

After binding to an RNA template and selecting 5\u2032-triphosphate ribonucleosides, viral RdRps synthesize an RNA copy according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The copy process sometimes deviates from both the base-pairing rules specified by the template and the natural ribose selectivity and, thus, the process is error-prone due to the intrinsic (in)fidelity of viral RdRps. These enzymes share a number of conserved amino-acid sequence strings, called motifs A\u2013G, which can be defined from a structural and functional point-of-view. A co-relation is gradually emerging between mutations in these motifs and viral genome evolution or observed mutation rates. Here, we review our current knowledge on these motifs and their role on the structural and mechanistic basis of the fidelity of nucleotide selection and RNA synthesis by Flavivirus RdRps.","publish_time":"2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selisko, Barbara; Papageorgiou, Nicolas; Ferron, Fran\u00E7ois; Canard, Bruno","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbcb78719cba8e781ca99c3069823e9270053ac3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5850366.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385764/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10020059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Flavivirus RdRps"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fidelity of viral RdRps","Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","RNA template","viral replication","RNA synthesis","viral genome evolution","motifs","Flavivirus RdRps","genetic evolution of viral RNAs","rules","copy process","central role","fidelity of nucleotide selection","Watson-Crick base","number of conserved amino-acid sequence strings","mechanistic basis","mutations","mutation rates","triphosphate ribonucleosides","natural ribose selectivity","enzymes","functional point","error-prone","current knowledge","view","co-relation","binding"],"language":"en"},

Though various fast Smith-Waterman implementations are developed, they are either designed as monolithic protein database searching tools, which do not return detailed alignment, or are embedded into other tools. These issues make reusing these efficient Smith-Waterman implementations impractical. RESULTS: To facilitate easy integration of the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we wrote a C/C\u002B\u002B library, which extends Farrar\u2019s Striped Smith-Waterman (SSW) to return alignment information in addition to the optimal Smith-Waterman score. In this library we developed a new method to generate the full optimal alignment results and a suboptimal score in linear space at little cost of efficiency. This improvement makes the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman become really useful in genomic applications. SSW is available both as a C/C\u002B\u002B software library, as well as a stand-alone alignment tool at: https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library. CONCLUSIONS: The SSW library has been used in the primary read mapping tool MOSAIK, the split-read mapping program SCISSORS, the MEI detector TANGRAM, and the read-overlap graph generation program RZMBLR. The speeds of the mentioned software are improved significantly by replacing their ordinary Smith-Waterman or banded Smith-Waterman module with the SSW Library.","publish_time":"2013-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Mengyao; Lee, Wan-Ping; Garrison, Erik P.; Marth, Gabor T.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/974ebdc4cd7ef424ed158a3d5dc349fefef5d35f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fb0191a305e3289b1be275259659e20b096247b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3852983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324759/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082138; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.6350v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSW","MEI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ordinary Smith-Waterman","optimal Smith-Waterman score","Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman algorithm","Farrar\u2019s Striped Smith-Waterman","banded Smith-Waterman module","various fast Smith-Waterman implementations","SSW library","efficient Smith-Waterman implementations impractical","optimal alignment","C\u002B\u002B library","C\u002B\u002B software library","alignment information","detailed alignment","fast Single-Instruction","stand-alone alignment tool","primary read mapping tool MOSAIK","mapping program SCISSORS","generation sequencing data","third-party software","mentioned software","RESULTS","key component of fast heuristic","variation detection tools","suboptimal score","graph generation program RZMBLR","split","linear space","MEI detector TANGRAM","little cost of efficiency","CONCLUSIONS","addition","easy integration","new method","monolithic protein database","genomic applications","improvement","BACKGROUND","speeds","issues","sequences"],"language":"en"},

One of these is the 3b protein, which is encoded by the second open reading frame in subgenomic RNA 3 and contains 154 amino acids. Here, a detailed time-course study was performed to compare the apoptosis and necrosis profiles induced by full-length 3b, a 3b mutant that was deleted by 30 amino acids from the C terminus (3b\u0394124-154) and the classical apoptosis inducer, Bax. Our results showed that Vero E6 cells transfected with a construct for expressing 3b underwent necrosis as early as 6h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time-points. At all the time-points analysed, the apoptosis induced by the expression of 3b was less than the level induced by Bax but the level of necrosis was comparable. The 3b\u0394124-154 mutant behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of the 3b protein does not seems to be important for the cell-death pathways since full-length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus, while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the induction of necrosis by a SARS-CoV protein.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Sehaam; Fielding, Burtram C.; Tan, Timothy H.P.; Chou, Chih-Fong; Shen, Shuo; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57bd23b3e3470ad1a6389bb584b5e16f1d907dfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114230.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170206001912; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170206001912","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["b mutant","b protein","level of necrosis","simultaneous necrosis","necrosis profiles","induction of necrosis","classical apoptosis inducer","later time-points","amino acids","Bax","3b\u0394124","SARS-CoV protein","detailed time-course study","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","accessory viral proteins","subgenomic RNA","known homologues","construct","cell-death pathways","Vero E6 cells","open reading frame","genome","C terminus","localization","transfection","results","similar manner","report","peri-nuclear regions","coronaviruses","nucleolus","expression","knowledge"],"language":"en"}]}

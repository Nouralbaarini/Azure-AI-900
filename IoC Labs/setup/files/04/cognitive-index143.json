Among these overlapping cellular functions are components of intracellular membrane trafficking pathways. Here, we review recent discoveries focused on how viruses exploit intracellular membrane trafficking pathways to promote various stages of their life cycle, with an emphasis on cellular factors that are usurped by a broad range of viruses. We describe broadly required components of the endocytic and secretory pathways, the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport pathway, and the autophagy pathway.

Molecular detection of these viruses in Brazil can transform to a big threat for poultry production due to risk for intestinal integrity. This disease is characterized by severely delayed growth, low uniformity, lethargy, watery diarrhea, delayed feed consumption, and a decreased conversion rate. Chicken astrovirus (CAstV), rotavirus, reovirus, chicken parvovirus (ChPV), fowl adenovirus of subgroup I (FAdV-1), and avian nephritis virus (ANV) were investigated using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which may play a role in enteric disease, was included. The viruses most frequently detected, either alone or in concomitance with other viruses, were IBV, ANV, rotavirus, and CAstV followed by parvovirus, reovirus, and adenovirus.

In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea. METHODS: All of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the 28th patient nationwide. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness. RESULTS: The median age was 40 years (range, 20\u201373 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%). Diarrhea was not common (10.7%). Two patients had no symptoms. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients. Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation. Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases. Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score was observed during the 5\u20137 day period after symptom onset. Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the upper respiratory tract (URT). CONCLUSION: The prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity. Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase. Radiological pneumonia was common from the early days of illness, but it was frequently not evident in simple CXR. These findings could be plausible explanations for the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Eu Suk; Chin, Bum Sik; Kang, Chang Kyung; Kim, Nam Joong; Kang, Yu Min; Choi, Jae-Phil; Oh, Dong Hyun; Kim, Jeong-Han; Koh, Boram; Kim, Seong Eun; Yun, Na Ra; Lee, Jae-Hoon; Kim, Jin Yong; Kim, Yeonjae; Bang, Ji Hwan; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Kim, Hong Bin; Chung, Ki-hyun; Oh, Myoung-don","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ad5a1ef0e00bd793a408c7915c6e207f360138f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131901.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lymphopenia"],"organizations":["URT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","common symptoms","early cases","severe cases","Radiological pneumonia","prodromal symptoms of COVID","SARS-CoV","clinical course","URT","clinical severity","early days of illness","infected pneumonia","Clinical data","progression of illness","Viral shedding","years","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","day period","prodromal phase","simple CXR","rapid spread of SARS","upper respiratory tract","chest radiographic score","Initial chest X-ray","outcomes of novel coronavirus disease","reactive protein","laboratory","virologic dynamics","BACKGROUND","real time polymerase chain reaction","plausible explanations","Higher level of C","median age","changes","range","computed tomography scan","infiltration","supplemental oxygen therapy","symptom onset","retrospective multicenter study","Wuhan","China","Republic of Korea","cough","CONCLUSION","Lymphopenia","limitations of daily activity","mechanical ventilation","RESULTS","findings","sore throat","community","METHODS","Diarrhea","male","fever"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of the present study was to explore the modulation of gene expression of some immune-inflammatory markers in buffaloes suffered from various digestive disorders. For this reason, 50 native breed water buffaloes were studied. Forty of these buffaloes showed various symptoms of digestive disorders and were allocated into 4 groups of equal sizes (group 1: uncategorized stomatitis; group 2: acute traumatic reticuloperitonitis [TRR]; group 3: acute rumen impaction; and group 4: undifferentiated enteritis). Ten apparently healthy buffaloes were randomly selected and considered as a control group. RNA was firstly extracted from the whole blood then a reverse transcription kits was used to convert the RNA to cDNA. Real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mRNAs of interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, IgG, and IgA, while glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used as an internal reference. The results of real-time PCR revealed a significant (P \u2264 0.05) upregulation of the gene expression of IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03B1 in blood of diseased buffaloes compared with those of controls. Animals showing acute TRP had peak values of both IL-6 and IL-10; while those exhibiting enteritis and rumen impaction had the highest values of IL-1\u03B2 and TNF-\u03B1, respectively. The results of qPCR also revealed a significant (P \u2264 0.05) downregulation of both IgG and IgA gene expression in blood of all diseased buffaloes compared with controls. The lowest values of both genes were recorded in buffaloes showing acute TRP. The results herein suggest that the tested genes could have a pivotal role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of the underlying diseases.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Youssef, Mohamed A.; El-Ashker, Maged R.; Ouda, Mohamed F.","journal":"Comp Clin Path","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9787532327b1e5359931979e879b9eb1ee58ad0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088432.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214977/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00580-017-2496-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","TRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene expression of IL","healthy buffaloes","blood of diseased buffaloes","highest values of IL","IgA gene expression","modulation of gene expression","gene expression of inflammatory cytokines","expression of mRNAs","control group","TNF-\u03B1","native breed water buffaloes","acute rumen impaction","acute TRP","various digestive disorders","results of real-time PCR","acute traumatic reticuloperitonitis","IgG","peak values","various symptoms of digestive disorders","digestive troubles","lowest values","results of qPCR","controls","tested genes","exhibiting enteritis","undifferentiated enteritis","immune-inflammatory markers","uncategorized stomatitis","pathophysiologic mechanism","pivotal role","downregulation","TRR","upregulation","status of immunoglobulins","groups of equal sizes","tumor necrosis factor","GAPDH","glyceraldehyde","reason","Animals","interleukin","reverse transcription kits","present study","phosphate dehydrogenase","scarce information","underlying diseases","internal reference","purpose","cDNA"],"language":"en"},

From the perspective of the dairy industry, they are the basis for the manufacture of butter and essential ingredients in the production of cheese, yogurt, and specialty dairy produce. To provide mechanistic insight into the assembly and secretion of lipid droplets during lactation, we developed novel intravital imaging techniques using transgenic mice, which express fluorescently tagged marker proteins. The number 4 mammary glands were surgically prepared under a deep plane of anesthesia and the exposed glands positioned as a skin flap with intact vascular supply on the stage of a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Lipid droplets were stained by prior exposure of the glands to hydrophobic fluorescent BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) dyes and their formation and secretion monitored by time-lapse subcellular microscopy over periods of 1 to 2 h. Droplets were transported to the cell apex by directed (superdiffusive) motion at relatively slow and intermittent rates (0\u20132 \u00B5m/min). Regardless of size, droplets grew by numerous fusion events during transport and as they were budding from the cell enveloped by apical membranes. Surprisingly, droplet secretion was not constitutive but required an injection of oxytocin to induce contraction of the myoepithelium with subsequent release of droplets into luminal spaces. These novel results are discussed in the context of the current paradigm for milk fat synthesis and secretion and as a template for future innovations in the dairy industry.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mather, Ian H.; Masedunskas, Andrius; Chen, Yun; Weigert, Roberto","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2406311fdb93aeb0257bff62ed5800ca5e2bd8ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094374.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30471915/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218310877; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030218310877","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["secretion of lipid droplets","subsequent release of droplets","droplet secretion","dairy industry","membrane-coated droplets of neutral lipid","exposed glands","mammary glands","milk fat synthesis","ABSTRACT Milk fat","specialty dairy produce","novel results","cell apex","novel intravital imaging techniques","hydrophobic fluorescent BODIPY","boron-dipyrromethene","skin flap","lactation","production of cheese","transgenic mice","current paradigm","intact vascular supply","prior exposure","survival","motion","stage","essential ingredients","contraction","yogurt","formation","dyes","context","myoepithelium","template","assembly","predominant source of lipids","time-lapse subcellular microscopy","numerous fusion events","manufacture of butter","future innovations","intermittent rates","laser","superdiffusive","deep plane of anesthesia","periods","luminal spaces","basis","injection of oxytocin","suckling neonate","transport","mechanistic insight","size","confocal microscope","\u00B5m","apical membranes","number"],"language":"en"},

Our experience confirms that neurological complications might be a likely event in COVID-19.

Endemic diseases are controlled by mass vaccination and preventive feed medication. Improvements in genetics, housing, equipment, and disease surveillance has allowed continued improvements in disease prevention. Attention to detail and management of risk is crucial to industry success. With fast industry growth and market maturity of the broiler industry, new challenges have risen.

Thereafter, 186 Korean people were infected with the MERS-CoV in a short time through human-to-human transmission. All these cases were linked to healthcare settings, and 25 (13.5 %) infected patients were healthcare workers. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the MERS-CoV isolate found in the Korean patient was closely related to the Qatar strain, and did not harbor transmission efficiency-improving mutations. Nevertheless, with the same infecting virus strain, Korea experienced the largest MERS-CoV outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula, primarily due to the different characteristics of population density and the healthcare system.

Virus discovery cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA) is a virus discovery method based on recognition of restriction enzyme cleavage sites, ligation of adaptors and subsequent amplification by PCR. However, direct discovery of unknown pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs is difficult due to the high concentration of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that acts as competitor. In the current study we optimized VIDISCA by adjusting the reverse transcription enzymes and decreasing rRNA amplification in the reverse transcription, using hexamer oligonucleotides that do not anneal to rRNA. Residual cDNA synthesis on rRNA templates was further reduced with oligonucleotides that anneal to rRNA but can not be extended due to 3\u2032-dideoxy-C6-modification. With these modifications \u003E90% reduction of rRNA amplification was established. Further improvement of the VIDISCA sensitivity was obtained by high throughput sequencing (VIDISCA-454). Eighteen nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed, all containing known respiratory viruses. We could identify the proper virus in the majority of samples tested (11/18). The median load in the VIDISCA-454 positive samples was 7.2 E5 viral genome copies/ml (ranging from 1.4 E3\u20137.7 E6). Our results show that optimization of VIDISCA and subsequent high-throughput-sequencing enhances sensitivity drastically and provides the opportunity to perform virus discovery directly in patient material.","publish_time":"2011-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vries, Michel; Deijs, Martin; Canuti, Marta; van Schaik, Barbera D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), influenza type A, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). Molecular prevalence of NDV, IBV, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2, MG, and MS was carried out on swab, and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of NDV, IBV, Influenza type A virus, MG, and MS in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4%, 50.9%, 12.7%, 14.5%, and 3.6%, respectively. Specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks, indicating concurrent viral infections. The molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2) while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected. The molecular prevalence rate of NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2 was 46.97%, 56.1%, and 19.7% in backyard flocks, respectively. Combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections, resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks, respectively. Mixed infection of IBV, LPAIV H9N2, and/or Escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks, inducing severe clinical outcomes. Avian pathogenic E. coli was, respectively, isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality. Mixed infection of E. coli and MG reported in 9.1% of broiler flock. MG was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while MS was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with E. coli, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection. Bidirectional synergistic interaction between these concurrently interacted respiratory pathogens explains the severe clinical impact and high mortality rate. The high prevalence of IBV (either as a single or combined infection) with LPAIV H9N2 and/or E. coli, in spite of intensive use of commercial vaccines, increases the need for revising vaccination programs and the application of standard biosecurity measures. Backyard chickens impose a great risk and threaten commercial flocks due to the high prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdelaziz, Adel M.; Mohamed, Mahmoud H.

Optimal conditions for performing this solid phase immune electron microscopy technique were a concentration 250 \u00B5g ml\u22121 of protein A; 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-tge virus hyperimmune serum for coating the grids and overnight incubation with virus samples. The possibility of detecting coronavirus in crude faeces was highly improved with solid phase immune electron microscopy, compared with conventional negative staining electron microscopy, by specific trapping of virus and prevention of adsorption of contaminants. The sensitivity of the method was evaluated by coded investigation of a dilution series of stock virus mixed with different pools of faeces. The improvement of virus detection in faeces by solid phase immune electron microscopy, compared with standard electron microscopy was at least 100-fold. Faecal shedding of coronavirus by pigs infected with virulent and attenuated strains of tge virus was studied. Virus detection in faeces by a standard electron microscopy technique was not practical, since the virus was obscured by a large quantity of debris in the faeces. By using solid phase immune electron microscopy, however, the aspect of the specimens on the grids improved so much that, in addition to more common immunofluorescence, the technique might be useful as a diagnostic test for tge. Virus was detected in daily faecal samples from one or two days after experimental infection with virulent tge virus, until death in five out of eight animals. Unlike immunofluorescence, solid phase immune electron microscopy may be used for diagnosis in living animals.","publish_time":"1988-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"VAN NIEUWSTADT, A.

Extensive studies suggest that the UPR can also be activated during virus infection. In the present studies, we first evaluated if porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection activated the UPR pathways. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated the morphology changes of ER post-PEDV infection. Western blot and real-time PCR identified the differences of UPR genes in response to PEDV infection. The results suggested that PEDV infection induced UPR in Vero cells. Meanwhile, we silenced the expression of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) by shRNA, we found that the knockdown of PERK increased virus loads in the cells, which was consistent with the result on 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) treatment. We next determined whether 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), an ER stress inducer, possessed antiviral activity against PEDV infection. Plaque formation assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis suggested that 2-DG might inhibit virus infection by affecting viral protein translation during the early stage of virus infection. Interestingly, we also found that 2-DG treatment could affect virus assembly, which is similar to previous studies on influenza virus. All these results support the therapeutic potential of using 2-DG or glucose/mannose analogs to induce the UPR to block virus replication.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yue; Li, Jia-rong; Sun, Ming-xia; Ni, Bo; Huan, Changchao; Huang, Li; Li, Chen; Fan, Hong-jie; Ren, Xiao-feng; Mao, Xiang","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99aeb8b55ac9d8282748592dbc88304d1edcfebc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113873.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.03.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214000813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681123/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214000813","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early stage of virus infection","virus assembly","influenza virus","virus replication","UPR pathways","morphology changes of ER post-PEDV infection","knockdown of PERK increased virus","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","differences of UPR genes","ER kinase","protein synthesis","ER stress inducer","unfolded protein response","Western blot analysis","previous studies","Extensive studies","results","present studies","glucose","treatment","viral protein translation","RT-PCR","real-time PCR","Vero cells","Electron microscopy analysis","antiviral activity","cyto-protective machinery","influx of large","Plaque formation assay","shRNA","endoplasmic reticulum","expression of PKR","phenylbutyrate","mannose analogs","Deoxy-d","PBA","therapeutic potential"],"language":"en"},

The study examined external reporting documents of 60 Hong Kong public companies, and found reading ease to be difficult and variability to be pervasive.

Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. METHODS: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8\u201312% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bansal, Manish","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37424b0e12f3627782b64ab6af0f4a6d063ba870.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102662.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300539; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300539; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","CV involvement","development of acute cardiac injury","cardiac abnormality","presence of pre-existing CV disease","outcomes of various CV manifestations","dominant clinical manifestation of COVID","significant elevation of cardiac troponins","significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement","coronavirus disease","Direct myocardial injury","Respiratory illness","viral involvement of cardiomyocytes","clinical presentation","literature search","Google search engines","common mechanisms responsible","PubMed","narrative review","effect of systemic inflammation","incidence","research","AIMS","interplay","optimum management","course","worse outcome","RESULTS","current reports","Adequate understanding","information","CONCLUSIONS","topic","METHODS","enormous burden","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We used self-completed and interviewer-completed contact diaries to quantify patterns of these contacts for 965 individuals in 2017/2018 in a high-income densely-populated area of China, Shanghai City. Interviewer-completed diaries recorded more social contacts (19.3 vs. 18.0) and longer social contact duration (35.0 vs. 29.1 hours) than self-reporting. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups especially among young participants (aged 7\u201320) and middle aged participants (25\u201355 years). 17.7% of participants reported touching animals (15.3% (pets), 0.0% (poultry) and 0.1% (livestock)). Human-human contact was very frequent but contact with animals (especially poultry) was rare although associated with frequent human-human contact. Hence, this densely populated area is more likely to act as an accelerator for human-human spread but less likely to be at the source of a zoonosis outbreak.

Here, we show that Protollin, a nasal adjuvant composed of Neisseria meningitides outer membrane proteins non-covalently linked to Shigella flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide, is a potent nasal adjuvant for an inactivated split virion H5N1 clade 1 A/Viet Nam1203/2004 (A/VN/1203/04) vaccine in a mouse model. Protollin-adjuvanted vaccines elicited enhanced serum protective hemagglutination inhibition titers, mucosal IgA responses, and H5N1-specific cell-mediated immunity that resulted in complete protection against a lethal challenge with a homologous virus as well as a heterologous clade 2 virus A/Indonesia/05/2005 (A/IN/05/05). Detailed analysis of adaptive immunity revealed that Protollin increased the frequency of lymphoid- as well as local tissue-resident antibody-secreting cells, local germinal center reaction of B cells, broad-spectrum of CD4 T cell response.

Therefore combating this disease is becoming increasingly difficult and this calls for finding alternate ways to control malaria. One of the feasible ways could be to find out inhibitors/drugs specific for the indispensable enzymes of malaria parasite such as helicases. These helicases, which contain intrinsic nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity, are capable of enzymatically unwinding energetically stable duplex nucleic acids into single-stranded templates and are required for all the nucleic acid transactions. Most of the helicases contain a set of nine extremely conserved amino acid sequences, which are called \u2018helicase motifs\u2019. Due to the presence of the DEAD (Asp\u2013Glu\u2013Ala\u2013Asp) in one of the conserved motifs, this family is also known as the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 family. In this review, using bioinformatic approach, we describe the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 helicases of malaria parasite P. falciparum. An in depth analysis shows that the parasite contains 22 full-length genes, some of which are homologues of well-characterized helicases of this family from other organisms. Recently we have cloned and characterized the first member of this family, which is a homologue of p68 and is expressed during the schizont stage of the development of the parasite [Pradhan, A., Chauhan, V.S., Tuteja, R., 2005a.

Plasmodium falciparum DNA helicase 60 is a schizont stage specific, bipolar and dual helicase stimulated by PKC phosphorylation. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 144, 133\u2013141.]. It will be really interesting to clone and characterize other members of the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 family and understand their role in the replication and transmission of the parasite. These detailed studies may help to identify a parasite-specific enzyme, which could be a potential drug target to treat malaria.

Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures. Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections. Therefore, understanding how hCoV\u2013host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans. Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoV\u2013host interactions that govern pathogenesis. Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus\u2013host interaction networks in disease. In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs. Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, an overarching directive of the World Health Organization. Although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates, we focus this review on the current state of hCoV mouse models, their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hCoV\u2013host interactions, and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions.","publish_time":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cockrell, Adam S.; Leist, Sarah R.; Douglas, Madeline G.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Mamm Genome","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83b302c75378ce58e35ef93b6214a6ec330998c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6132729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043100/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-018-9760-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis models","host interactions","complex hCoV","host genetics","robust mouse models","current state of hCoV mouse models","human populations","human spread","elucidating hCoV","pathogenic human coronaviruses","effective mammalian models","pathogenesis of hCoVs","tractable mouse genetics","non-human primates","host interaction networks","potential disease phenotypes","acute etiology of hCoV infections","pathogenic outcomes","global economies","Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential","development of virus","therapeutic strategies","preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions","tractable complex genetic organisms","high mortality rates","global pathogen preparedness","concomitant manipulation of virus","etiologies of known hCoVs","high morbidity","genetic systems","Global pandemic concerns stem","complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures","desirable preclinical platform","overarching directive","tools","driving force underpinning mice","predictive value","respiratory transmission","review","capacity","pre-emergent CoVs","species barrier","World Health Organization","addition","emergence","results","Pragmatism","decades","humans"],"language":"en"},

The virus caused several outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region during the past two decades and has been considered a significant public health problem in the post-poliovirus eradication era. Unlike poliovirus, there is no effective vaccine or approved antivirals against EV71. To explore anti-EV71 agents therefore is of vital importance. Several strategies have been employed to develop antivirals based on the molecular characteristics of the virus. Among these, some small molecules that were developed against human rhinoviruses and poliovirus are under evaluation. In this review, we discuss the recent development of such small molecules against EV71, known drug resistance and possible solutions to it, and animal models for evaluating the efficacy of these antivirals. Although further investigation is required for clinical applications of the existing candidates, the molecular mechanisms revealed for the inhibition of EV71 replication can be used for designing new molecules against this virus in the future.","publish_time":"2013-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuo, Rei-Lin; Shih, Shin-Ru","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cb55c99b99ef1944a0b43b342a8bc9eda6ae227.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3614426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23339605/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-28","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["small molecules","anti-EV71 agents","inhibition of EV71 replication","new molecules","approved antivirals","human rhinoviruses","post-poliovirus eradication era","molecular mechanisms","molecular characteristics","important human pathogen","severe neurological complications","significant public health problem","drug resistance","Asia-Pacific region","existing candidates","possible solutions","effective vaccine","recent development","clinical applications","decades","death","children","outbreaks","animal models","vital importance","efficacy","evaluation","investigation","review","future","strategies","Enterovirus"],"language":"en"},

Methods Suspected cases were the children with an influenza-like illness during June 20 to 26, 2018. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and screened to determine the presence of respiratory pathogens by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The HN and F gene sequences of HPIV-positive samples were further amplified and sequenced to confirm the HPIV genotype and identify genetic characteristics. A phylogenetic tree, based on the HN and F genes, was reconstructed by maximum likelihood method. Results Fourteen children in the outbreak were diagnosed as upper respiratory tract infection. The most common symptom was cough (10/14), followed by rhinorrhea (5/14), sore throat (4/14), headache (1/14), and abdominal pain (1/14). Eight patients were positive for HPIV1 and negative for other pathogens. Phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the eight strains from the year 2018 in our study located in the clade 2.3. Two specific substitutions (N333S and I509M) in the amino acids of the F protein and two substitutions (V19A and L436I) in the HN protein were different from other strains in the clade 2.

The primary purpose of this study is to review and present current evidence and recommendations for personal protective equipment and safety recommendations for orthopaedic surgeons and trauma surgeons. METHODS: A systematic review of the available literature was performed using the keyword terms \u201CCOVID-19\u201D, \u201CCoronavirus\u201D, \u201Csurgeon\u201D, \u201Chealth-care workers\u201D, \u201Cprotection\u201D, \u201Cmasks\u201D, \u201Cgloves\u201D, \u201Cgowns\u201D, \u201Chelmets\u201D, and \u201Caerosol\u201D in several combinations. The following databases were assessed: Pubmed, Cochrane Reviews, Google Scholar. Due to the paucity of available data, it was decided to present it in a narrative manner. In addition, participating doctors were asked to provide their guidelines for PPE in their countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, UK) for consideration in the presented practice recommendations. RESULTS: World Health Organization guidance for respiratory aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as intubation in a COVID19 environment was clear and included the use of an FFP3 (filtering face piece level 3) mask and face protection. However, the recommendation for surgical AGPs, such as the use of high-speed power tools in the operating theatre, was not clear until the UK Public Health England (PHE) guidance of 27 March 2020. This guidance included FFP3 masks and face protection, which UK surgeons quickly adopted. The recommended PPE for orthopaedic surgeons, working in a COVID19 environment, should consist of level 4 surgical gowns, face shields or goggles, double gloves, FFP2-3 or N95-99 respirator masks. An alternative to the mask, face shield and goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure. However, there is a high cost and limited availabilty of these devices at present. Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake. During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles. Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery. In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.

They are natural hosts for viruses as they carry their own indigenous viruses. Both yeasts have been used for studies of plant, animal and human viruses. Many positive sense (\u002B) RNA viruses and some DNA viruses replicate with various levels in yeasts, thus allowing study of those viral activities during viral life cycle. Yeasts are single cell eukaryotic organisms. Hence, many of the fundamental cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation or programed cell death are highly conserved from yeasts to higher eukaryotes. Therefore, they are particularly suited to study the impact of those viral activities on related cellular activities during virus-host interactions. Yeasts present many unique advantages in virus research over high eukaryotes. Yeast cells are easy to maintain in the laboratory with relative short doubling time. They are non-biohazardous, genetically amendable with small genomes that permit genome-wide analysis of virologic and cellular functions. In this review, similarities and differences of these two yeasts are described. Studies of virologic activities such as viral translation, viral replication and genome-wide study of virus-cell interactions in yeasts are highlighted. Impacts of viral proteins on basic cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation and programed cell death are discussed.

Three new epitopes, 56QIRWRMRRGERI67, 318GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVA VRE342 and 398HEEAIYDDV406, were firstly identified in the viral N-protein, by using McAbs 3F10, 6A11, and 1C9. The epitope 398HEEAIYDDV406 was deleted in SH strain (isolated by our lab) and different between CV777 and YZ strain (isolated by our lab). To study the characters of this epitope, four peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of SH and CV777 and used in the study. The result showed that the 398th amino acid maybe an important amino acid of the epitope. Biological information analysis showed that the three B cell linear epitopes are highly conserved among different PEDV isolates. In addition, McAb 1C9, which attached to the epitope 398HEEAIYDDV406, showed variant reactivity with PEDV CV777, SH, YZ and MS strains. McAb 1C9 reacted with PEDV strains CV777 and YZ, but not with SH which had a deletion from 399 to 410 amino acids in N-protein (No. MK841494).

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of the first 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after thoracic surgery in early January 2020. Postoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records and the time line of clinical course were summarized. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated. RESULTS In the 11 confirmed cases (3 female, 8 male), median days from symptom onset to case detection was 8. Insidious symptom onset and misinterpreted postoperative changes on chest computed tomography (CT) resulted in delay in diagnosis. There were 3 fatalities due to respiratory failure, whereas 4 severe and 4 mild cases recovered and were discharged. All patients had once experienced leukocytosis and eosinopenia. Remittent fever and resected lung segments \u22655 were associated with fatality. CONCLUSIONS The case fatality rate of postsurgical patients subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 was 27.3%.

During 2008, two distinct cases of parvoviral infection were diagnosed in our laboratories. A CPV-2a variant was identified in a 3-month-old Persian kitten displaying clinical sign of feline panleukopenia (FPL) (acute gastroenteritis and marked leukopenia) and oral ulcerations, that died eight days after the onset of the disease. Two pups living in the same pet shop as the cat were found to shed a CPV-2a strain genetically identical to the feline virus and were likely the source of infection. Also, non-fatal infection by a CPV-2c strain occurred in a 2.5-month-old European shorthair kitten displaying non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea and normal white blood cell counts. By sequence analysis of the major capsid protein (VP2) gene, the feline CPV-2c strain showed 100% identity to a recent canine type-2c isolate. Both kittens had been administered multivalent vaccines against common feline pathogens including FPL virus. Whether and to which extent the FPL vaccines can protect cats adequately from the antigenic variants of CPV-2 should be assessed.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Decaro, Nicola; Buonavoglia, Domenico; Desario, Costantina; Amorisco, Francesca; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Parisi, Antonio; Terio, Valentina; Elia, Gabriella; Lucente, Maria Stella; Cavalli, Alessandra; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37549cfc99a4dedfc3a395b7a8a3ea2ad37ec3d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118797.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528810000755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20334885/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528810000755; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.03.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feline CPV","antigenic variants of CPV","feline virus","feline host","c strain","FPL vaccines","FPL virus","common feline pathogens","clinical sign of feline panleukopenia","cats","non-fatal infection","c isolate","source of infection","month-old Persian kitten","recent canine type","month-old European shorthair kitten","original canine parvovirus type","multivalent vaccines","disease patterns","distinct cases of parvoviral infection","non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea","normal white blood cell counts","major capsid protein","acute gastroenteritis","VP2","gene","marked leukopenia","identity","oral ulcerations","sequence analysis","days","limited information","Abstract","pet shop","extent","pups","onset","kittens","laboratories","ability"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of ICU admission and morality risk in diabetic COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESING: A database search was conducted to identify studies comparing diabetic COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) and those reporting the overall mortality of these patients published up to March 25, 2020 within MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The main outcome was the risk of ICU admission in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection while the second was the mortality risk in overall diabetic COVID-19 patients. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure with the related 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Among 1382 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 798 males), DM resulted to be the second more frequent comorbidities. Diabetic patients resulted to have a significant increased risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.79, 95 % CI 1.85\u20134.22, p \u003C 0.0001, I(2) = 46 %). In 471 patients (mean age 56.6 years, 294 males) analysed for the secondary outcome diabetic subjects resulted to be at higher mortality risk (OR 3.21, 95 % CI 1.82\u20135.64, p \u003C 0.0001, I(2) = 16 %).

Abstract The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes 50% to 90% of all bronchiolitis cases in infants. The occurrence and severity of bronchiolitis are dependent on patient-related factors (preterm birth, comorbidities, individual susceptibility), virus-related factors (RSV A), and environmental factors (pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, and others). Mortality rates in infants with bronchiolitis range from 0.005% to 0.2% according to patient-related factors. The pathophysiology of RSV bronchiolitis is unknown but clearly involves direct effects of the virus on the airway epithelium, airway immaturity, and recently identified effects of the inflammatory response. Immunopathologic mechanisms (e.g., IgE antibodies and CD4\u002B Th2 cells) play a role in some infants or in severe forms. Complete immunity to the virus is never achieved, and repeat infections are common in the young and the elderly, in whom the RSV causes about 5% of all lower respiratory tract infections. VPI3 infections usually cause bronchiolitis, whereas VPI1 and VPI2 infections manifest chiefly as laryngotracheitis. Little is known about the clinical expression of VPI4 infection. Bronchiolitis due to hMPV is indistinguishable from RSV bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2004-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, F","journal":"EMC - P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7019b3dbc17f7e99ce433317c32bc97b64f60ae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1762601303000119; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1762601303000119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRS","RSV","VPI3"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the elderly","The pathophysiology","The occurrence","VRS","common in the young","the airway epithelium","Abstract The respiratory syncytial virus","in whom the RSV causes about","the inflammatory response","bronchiolitis cases in infants","Complete immunity to the virus is never achieved","to hMPV is indistinguishable from RSV bronchiolitis","repeat infections","related factors","bronchiolites du nourrisson","virus respiratoire syncytial","VPI3 infections usually cause bronchiolitis","Mortality rates in infants with bronchiolitis","Little is known about the clinical expression","environmental factors","expression clinique des infections","gravit\u00E9 des bronchiolites","role in some infants","RSV bronchiolitis is unknown but clearly involves direct effects","in severe forms","according to patient","lower respiratory tract infections","r\u00F4le direct","pollution","responsable","terrain","VPI2 infections manifest chiefly as laryngotracheitis","airway immaturity","Th2 cells","IgE antibodies","anticorps IgE","r\u00E9ponse CD4","jeunes enfants","VPI4 infection","facteurs li\u00E9s","facteurs importants","physiopathologie de la bronchiolite","immaturit\u00E9 du nourrisson","recently identified effects","environmental tobacco smoke","mortalit\u00E9 de la bronchiolite va","whereas VPI1","preterm birth","play","comorbidities","individual susceptibility","pr\u00E9maturit\u00E9","dependent","pathologie associ\u00E9e","personnes \u00E2g\u00E9es","pr\u00E9disposition","points comparables","severity","m\u00E9canismes immunopathologiques","r\u00E9action inflammatoire","r\u00E9infections","\u00E9pith\u00E9lium","celles","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","tabagisme","Immunopathologic mechanisms","others","gen\u00E8se","atteintes respiratoires basses","formes graves","laryngotrach\u00E9ites","immunit\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

We investigated whether IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection. We conducted quantification of infectious virus or viral RNA, immunofluorescent (IF) staining for the detection of PDCoV antigens, and TUNEL assay in IPEC-J2 cells inoculated with the strain OH-FD22-P8 grown in LLC-PK cells, and supplemented with 10 \u03BCg/ml of trypsin in the cell culture medium. Cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified by the 3rd viral passage in the IPEC-J2 cells. PDCoV antigen was detected in the cells showing CPE. By double IF and TUNEL staining, most PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals, indicating that PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not undergo apoptosis, but rather necrosis, similar to necrotic cell death of infected enterocytes in vivo. There was increased interleukin-6 in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cell culture supernatants at post-inoculation hour (PIH) 48\u201396, as evaluated by ELISA, concurrent with increased titers of PDCoV at PIH 24\u201372. The susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection supports their usefulness to characterize the interactions of enterocytes with PDCoV. We also demonstrated that IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) was enteropathogenic in 10-day-old gnotobiotic pigs, and induced systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during the acute PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Miyazaki, Ayako; Hu, Hui; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d894d456e2457014fd72331b48c42be3f6d263c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981708/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.05.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351830422X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351830422X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells","PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells","IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV","PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cell culture supernatants","acute PDCoV infection","susceptibility of IPEC","rounded cells","increased titers of PDCoV","detection of PDCoV antigens","LLC-PK cells","cell shrinkage","cell culture medium","necrotic cell death of infected enterocytes","TUNEL staining","interactions of enterocytes","porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line","TUNEL assay","P8","TUNEL-positive signals","PIH","CPE","strain OH-FD22","porcine deltacoronavirus","viral RNA","viral passage","increased interleukin","pro-inflammatory cytokine responses","post-inoculation hour","necrosis","day-old gnotobiotic pigs","quantification of infectious virus","usefulness","enteropathogenic","trypsin","apoptosis","ELISA","P4","enteric viruses","detachment","Cytopathic effects","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

From 1960, six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes SARS-CoV and the recent infection by deadly MERS-CoV which is now going to cause another outbreak. Prevention of these viruses is urgent and a universal vaccine for all strain could be a promising solution in this circumstance. In this study we aimed to design an epitope based vaccine against all strain of human coronavirus. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) approach was employed among spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab to identify which one is highly conserve in all coronaviruses strains. Next, we use various in silico tools to predict consensus immunogenic and conserved peptide. We found that conserved region is present only in the RNA directed RNA polymerase protein. In this protein we identified one epitope WDYPKCDRA is highly immunogenic and 100% conserved among all available human coronavirus strains.

The HAdVs were detected using a respiratory virus panel fast assay (xTAG RVP FAST v2) and with a HAdV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction; their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Among 307 nasopharyngeal samples, 61 (19.9%) tested positive for HAdV. HAdV was the only virus detected in 31/61 (50.8%) cases, whereas it was found in association with one other virus in 25 (41.0%) cases and with two or more viruses in 5 (8.2%) cases. Human Enterovirus/human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common co-infecting viral agents and were found in 12 (19.7%) and 7 (11.5%) samples, respectively. Overall, the HAdV strain sequences analyzed were highly conserved. In comparison to HAdV-negative children, those infected with HAdV had a reduced frequency of lower respiratory tract involvement (36.1% vs 55.2%; p = 0.007), wheezing (0.0% vs 12.5%; p = 0.004), and hospitalization (27.9% vs 56.1%; p\u003C0.001). Antibiotic therapy and white blood cell counts were more frequently prescribed (91.9% vs 57.1%; p = 0.04) and higher (17,244 \u00B1 7,737 vs 9,565 \u00B1 3,211 cells/\u03BCL; p = 0.04), respectively, in children infected by HAdV-C than among those infected by HAdV-B. On the contrary, those infected by HAdV-B had more frequently lower respiratory tract involvement (57.1% vs 29.7%) but difference did not reach statistical significant (p = 0.21). Children with high viral load were absent from child care attendance for a longer period of time (14.5 \u00B1 7.5 vs 5.5 \u00B1 3.2 days; p = 0.002) and had higher C reactive protein levels (41.3 \u00B1 78.5 vs 5.4 \u00B1 9.6 \u03BCg/dL; p = 0.03). This study has shown that HAdV infections are diagnosed more commonly than usually thought and that HAdVs are stable infectious agents that do not frequently cause severe diseases. A trend toward more complex disease in cases due to HAdV species C and in those with higher viral load was demonstrated. However, further studies are needed to clarify factors contributing to disease severity to understand how to develop adequate preventive and therapeutic measures.","publish_time":"2016-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Zampiero, Alberto; Bianchini, Sonia; Mori, Alessandro; Scala, Alessia; Tagliabue, Claudia; Sciarrabba, Calogero Sathya; Fossali, Emilio; Piralla, Antonio; Principi, Nicola","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddc5f3a230c72bfbbbd1b0235b21ae8d8ad4221e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4821614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045588/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Milan"],"keyphrases":["HAdV-C","HAdV infections","HAdV-B","HAdV species C","HAdV-negative children","HAdV strain sequences","cases","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory tract infection","pediatric respiratory infections","respiratory virus panel fast assay","HAdV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction","higher viral load","reduced frequency of lower respiratory tract involvement","healthy children","human rhinovirus","Human Enterovirus","high viral load","HAdVs","nasopharyngeal samples","higher C reactive protein levels","predominant human adenovirus","common co-infecting viral agents","nasopharyngeal swabs","complex disease","disease severity","positive selection","stable infectious agents","xTAG RVP FAST v2","child care attendance","white blood cell counts","types","Antibiotic therapy","emergency room","Italy","longer period of time","nucleotides","Milan","adequate preventive","therapeutic measures","factors","difference","trend","comparison","cells","\u03BCL","study","hospitalization","days","\u03BCg","severe diseases","subsequent years","studies","viruses","association"],"language":"en"},

In 2009, it translated its contingency plan to respond to the unfolding influenza pandemic. However, little is known of how Malawi translated its national influenza plan into response actions, or the success of these responses. Objective: To investigate how Malawi translated its preparedness plan and so broaden our understanding of the outcomes of the responses. Methods: We draw on data from 22 in-depth interviews with government policymakers and people working at a policy level in various non-governmental organisations, conducted to assess the level of preparedness and the challenges of translating this. Results: Through a number of public health initiatives, authorities developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance activities and updated overall goals in pandemic training and education. However, without influenza drills, exercises and simulations to test the plan, activating the pandemic plan, including coordinating and deploying generic infection control measures, was problematic. Responses during the pandemic were at times \u2018weak and clumsy\u2019 and failed to mirror the activities and processes highlighted in the preparedness plan. Conclusions: Participants stressed that in order to achieve a coordinated and successful response to mitigate and prevent the further transmission of pandemic influenza, good preparation was critical. The key elements which they identified as relevant for a rapid response included effective communications, robust evidence-based decision-making, strong and reliable surveillance systems and flexible public health responses. To effectively articulate a viable trajectory of pandemic responses, the potential value of simulation exercises could be given more consideration as a mean of sustaining good levels of preparedness and responses against future pandemics. These all demand a well-structured planning for and response to pandemic influenza strategy developed by a functioning scientific and policy advisory committee.","publish_time":"2017-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sambala, Evanson Z.; Manderson, Lenore","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9b2738ea98d39ed9c2080bc308e1f57dcc512d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5645665.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753109/; https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2017.1341225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["pandemic plan","preparedness plan","national influenza plan","pandemic influenza strategy","transmission of pandemic influenza","unfolding influenza pandemic","influenza drills","pandemic training","contingency plan","viable trajectory of pandemic responses","influenza surveillance activities","level of preparedness","Malawi","flexible public health responses","rapid response","response actions","successful response","good levels of preparedness","policy level","number of public health initiatives","good preparation","burden of infection","reliable surveillance systems","policy advisory committee","potential value of simulation exercises","generic infection control measures","robust evidence-based decision-making","communication strategies","effective communications","authorities","overall goals","people","coordinating","various non-governmental organisations","in-depth interviews","government policymakers","order","data","consideration","education","mean","times","simulations","understanding","future pandemics","well-structured planning","processes","Conclusions","Participants","key elements","outbreak","Results","outcomes","challenges","Methods","Background","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Across the interview sample there was a shared consensus that most people associated MRSA not with the history of antibiotic use, but with dirty and poorly managed hospitals.

Budding of typical coronavirus particles, through intracytoplasmic membranes and accumulation of complete virus within cytoplasmic vesicles or the lumen of rough endoplasmic reticulum, were the main features of the viral morphogenesis. Late in infection, numerous progeny viral particles were shown at the outer surface of infected cells, but budding could not be demonstrated at this level. Two different types of surface projections were observed on the extracellular particles of this avian coronavirus.

This study assessed the economic impact of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) on families with children attending childcare using a societal perspective. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in 90 childcare centres and one general practitioner clinics in Sydney, Australia, during 2010. Healthy children aged \u22656 months to \u003C3 years were enrolled. Economic impacts of ILI (temperature \u226537\u00B78\u00B0C or parental report of fever, plus \u22651 respiratory symptoms) were collected at 2 and 4 weeks after ILI onset by telephone interview. Parent\u2010collected respiratory specimens were tested for respiratory viruses using real\u2010time PCR (RT\u2010PCR). Costs associated with healthcare visits, medication usage, carer time lost (work or recreation) and home care and/or additional childcare were collected. Influenza\u2010like illness costs were described and further analysed using a Tobit model. Zero\u2010inflated Poisson regression was employed to compare the numbers of healthcare visits for each ILI. RESULTS: Of 381 children enrolled and analysed, 105 developed 124 ILIs. Specimens were available for 117 ILIs: five were positive by RT\u2010PCR for A(H1N1)pdm09, 39 for adenovirus, 39 for rhinovirus, 15 for a coronavirus and 27 for a polyomavirus. The mean cost of all ILIs was AU$626 (95% confidence interval: AU$484\u2013768) per ILI with no significant differences observed between viruses. Carers lost on average 13 hours of work and 3 hours of leisure time per ILI. Independent drivers of ILI costs were having both parents in employed work and longer duration of ILI. In multivariate analyses, four variables were significantly associated with an increased number of healthcare visits per ILI: non\u2010Caucasian child, living in a detached house, both parents in employed work and having an ILI with one or more viruses identified. CONCLUSIONS: For families with a child attending childcare, ILIs cause a substantial economic burden. An ILI in a child with working parents and/or with longer duration appears to cost more in monetary terms. Healthcare visits were increased if the child was non\u2010Caucasian, lived in a detached house, had working parents or had a virus\u2010positive ILI.

We have identified here the main venom proteins of two braconid wasps, Psyttalia lounsburyi (two strains from South Africa and Kenya) and P. concolor, olive fruit fly parasitoids that differ in host range. Among the shared abundant proteins, we found a GH1 \u03B2-glucosidase and a family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Olive is extremely rich in glycoside compounds that are hydrolyzed by \u03B2-glucosidases into defensive toxic products in response to phytophagous insect attacks. Assuming that Psyttalia host larvae sequester ingested glycosides, the injected venom GH1 \u03B2-glucosidase could induce the release of toxic compounds, thus participating in parasitism success by weakening the host. Venom LRR proteins are similar to truncated Toll-like receptors and may possibly scavenge the host immunity. The abundance of one of these LRR proteins in the venom of only one of the two P. lounsburyi strains evidences intraspecific variation in venom composition. Altogether, venom intra- and inter-specific variation in Psyttalia spp. were much lower than previously reported in the Leptopilina genus (Figitidae), suggesting it might depend upon the parasitoid taxa.","publish_time":"2016-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Math\u00E9-Hubert, Hugo; Colinet, Dominique; Deleury, Emeline; Belghazi, Maya; Ravallec, Marc; Poulain, Julie; Dossat, Carole; Poiri\u00E9, Maryl\u00E8ne; Gatti, Jean-Luc","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23659bd7c1db907c08518313703d6ce64bc8ce63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5078806.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep35873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27779241/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Psyttalia","LRR"],"locations":["South Africa","Kenya"],"keyphrases":["Venom LRR proteins","main venom proteins","Venom composition of parasitoid wasps","injected venom GH1 \u03B2-glucosidase","Psyttalia host larvae","Psyttalia lounsburyi","host range","host immunity","shared abundant proteins","\u03B2-glucosidases","parasitism success","parasitoid taxa","lounsburyi strains evidences intraspecific variation","release of toxic compounds","inter-specific variation","braconid wasps","rich repeat","glycoside compounds","defensive toxic products","olive fruit fly parasitoids","ingested glycosides","response","concolor","molecules","family of leucine","truncated Toll","phytophagous insect attacks","Kenya","South Africa","arthropod pests","receptors","Leptopilina genus","Figitidae","abundance"],"language":"en"},

Since China is still in the process of urbanisation, the greatest challenge it faces is finding a balance between economic growth and keeping carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emission rates at a manageable level. Cities in China play a key role in the implementation of the central policies and make concrete actions in response to climate change. With reference to a series of recent policy papers and action plans as the background, this paper attempts to provide a critical overview of China\u0027s climate change action plans from the national to the city and urban level. It seeks to understand whether the proposed responses to climate change and strategies for actions on greening and air corridors for cities and urban areas are appropriate. It is found that for China to advance its urban climatic adaptation strategy there is a need for (1) urban data, (2) a cross-disciplinary impact assessment, and (3) the development of a market and policy transformation mechanism.","publish_time":"2017-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Edward; Ren, Chao","journal":"Urban Clim","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6b63c5313ee999b9309accf52057fd1703de8df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185547.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212095517300627; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2017.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363139/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095517300627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York","China"],"keyphrases":["climate change mitigation","Climate Summit","urban level","urban areas","urban data","critical overview of China\u0027s climate change action plans","national policies","Cities","urban climatic adaptation strategy","concrete actions","central policies","manageable level","policy transformation mechanism","series of recent policy papers","carbon dioxide","greenhouse gas emission rates","strategies","air corridors","greening","terms of economics","need","unpredictable extreme weather events","economic growth","key role","Conference","balance","market","implementation","COP21","New York","background","proposed responses","city","greatest challenge","heavy cost","public health","process of urbanisation","cross-disciplinary impact assessment","Parties","development","reference","Paris","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The CDC\u0027s influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) criteria (fever \u2265100\u00B0F with cough and/or sore throat) are a screening tool for influenza with unknown applicability to the transplant population. METHODS: We reviewed all respiratory virus PCR tests performed on adult patients with a history of solid organ (SOT) or stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during the 2012\u20132013 influenza season. The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of ILI criteria were calculated. RESULTS: Of 126 transplant patients (66 HSCT, 60 SOT), 54 (42.8%) tested positive for an RVI by PCR: 24 influenza and 30 non\u2010influenza. Of 30 patients who met ILI criteria, 12 (40%) were positive for influenza. The PPV and NPV of ILI for influenza were 50% and 82.4%, respectively. Mortality was low (3.7%), but morbidity was high (14.8% required ICU stay) among transplant patients diagnosed with RVI. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza and non\u2010influenza RVIs are associated with significant morbidity among transplant patients. CDC ILI criteria correlate poorly with PCR\u2010positive cases of influenza in transplant patients, but may be useful in excluding the diagnosis. Routine RVI PCR testing is recommended for better diagnosis and improved antiviral use in transplant patients with suspected RVI.","publish_time":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Claus, Jonathan A.; Hodowanec, Aimee C.; Singh, Kamaljit","journal":"Clin Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a048f31002dc5d2c5e690f8afa5ef076c6e05a2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162202.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.12600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26338182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","ILI","PPV","RVI","CDC ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transplant patients","CDC\u0027s influenza","influenza season","positive cases of influenza","non\u2010influenza RVIs","adult patients","transplant population","NPV of ILI","CDC ILI criteria","significant morbidity","Routine RVI PCR testing","suspected RVI","respiratory virus PCR tests","significant cause of morbidity","SOT","PPV","HSCT","mortality","better diagnosis","Respiratory viral infections","improved antiviral use","screening tool","unknown applicability","history of solid organ","negative predictive values","stem cell transplantation","fever","illness","sore throat","cough","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","ICU","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Surprisingly, field data are scant concerning the prevalence of respiratory pathogens involved in BRD in preweaned dairy calves, especially in small herds. OBJECTIVES: To identify the main respiratory pathogens isolated from calves in Qu\u00E9bec dairy herds with a high incidence of BRD, and to determine if there is an association between the presence of these pathogens and clinical signs of pneumonia, lung consolidation, or average daily gain. ANIMALS: Cross\u2010sectional study using a convenience sample of 95 preweaned dairy calves from 11 dairy herds. METHODS: At enrollment, calves were weighed, clinically examined, swabbed (nasal and nasopharyngeal), and lung ultrasonography was performed. One month later, all calves were reweighed. RESULTS: Twenty\u2010two calves had clinical BRD and 49 had ultrasonographic evidence of lung consolidation. Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni were isolated in 54, 17, and 12 calves, respectively. Mycoplasma bovis was identified by PCR testing or culture in 19 calves, and 78 calves were found to be positive for Mycoplasma spp. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 38 calves and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in 1. Only the presence of M. bovis was associated with higher odds of clinical signs, lung consolidation, and lower average daily gain.

In 2015, ZIKV triggered a large epidemic in Brazil and spread across Latin America. In November of that year, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV was isolated from the brain tissue of a fetus diagnosed with microcephaly, and recent studies in mice models revealed that ZIKV infection may cause brain defects by influencing brain cell developments. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which ZIKV alters neurophysiological development remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by translational repression. In order to gain insight into the possible role of ZIKV-mediated miRNA signaling dysfunction in brain-tissue development, we computationally predicted new miRNAs encoded by the ZIKV genome and their effective hybridization with transcripts from human genes previously shown to be involved in microcephalia. The results of these studies suggest a possible role of these miRNAs on the expression of human genes associated with this disease. Besides, a new ZIKV miRNA was predicted in the 3\u2019stem loop (3\u2019 SL) of the 3\u2019untranslated region (3\u2019UTR) of the ZIKV genome, suggesting the role of the 3\u2019UTR of flaviviruses as a source of miRNAs.","publish_time":"2016-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cristina, Juan; Echeverr\u00EDa, Natalia; Gambaro, Fabiana; Fajardo, Alvaro; Moreno, Pilar","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44a440cc1c135c938d2216ea672f8ef4f9c01296.json; document_parses/pdf_json/df54dd28a467d17de305e8c41a3a5b58ab702952.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/070656","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["Latin America","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV genome","ZIKV infection","ZIKV outbreak","possible role of ZIKV","new ZIKV miRNA","brain tissue","new miRNAs","brain-tissue development","brain defects","source of miRNAs","expression of human genes","brain cell developments","mediated miRNA","recent studies","neurophysiological development","UTR of flaviviruses","cases of neonatal microcephaly","post-transcriptional gene expression","small noncoding RNAs","effective hybridization","dysfunction","mice models","fold increase","translational repression","transcripts","member","fetus","insight","Brazilian Ministry of Health","large epidemic","year","MicroRNAs","mechanisms","Latin America","untranslated region","Zika virus","stem loop","family Flaviviridae","order","disease","results","microcephalia"],"language":"en"},

The PEDV spike (S) protein contains two intracellular sorting motifs, Yxx\u03A6 (tyrosine-based motif YEVF or YEAF) and KVHVQ at the cytoplasmic tail, yet their functions have not been fully elucidated. Some Vero cell-adapted and/or attenuated PEDV variants contain ablations in these two motifs. We hypothesized that these motifs contribute to viral pathogenicity. By transiently expressing PEDV S proteins with mutations in the motifs, we confirmed that the motif KVHVQ is involved in retention of the S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In addition, we showed that the Yxx\u03A6 motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins. These two motifs synergistically regulate the level of S expressed on the cell surface. To investigate their role in viral pathogenicity, we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing deletions or a mutation in the two motifs of the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A): (i) ic\u039410aa (\u0394Yxx\u03A6EKVHVQ), (ii) ic\u03945aa (\u0394KVHVQ), and (iii) icYA (Y1378A, to an inactivated motif, AEVF). Infection of Vero cells with ic\u039410aa resulted in larger syncytia and more virions, with reduced numbers of S protein projections on the surface compared with icPC22A. Furthermore, we orally inoculated five groups of 5-day-old gnotobiotic piglets with the three mutants, icPC22A, or a mock treatment. Mutant ic\u039410aa caused less severe diarrhea rate and significantly milder intestinal lesions than icPC22A, ic\u03945aa, and icYA. These data suggest that the deletion of both motifs can reduce the virulence of PEDV in piglets. IMPORTANCE Many coronaviruses (CoVs) possess conserved motifs Yxx\u03A6 and/or KxHxx/KKxx in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. The KxHxx/KKxx motif has been identified as the ER retrieval signal, but the function of the Yxx\u03A6 motif in the intracellular sorting of CoV S proteins remains controversial. In this study, we showed that the Yxx\u03A6 of PEDV S protein is an endocytosis signal. Furthermore, using reverse genetics technology, we evaluated its role in PEDV pathogenicity in neonatal piglets. Our results explain one attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants lacking functional Yxx\u03A6 and KVHVQ motifs. Knowledge from this study may aid in the design of efficacious live attenuated vaccines against PEDV, as well as other CoVs bearing the same motif in their S protein.","publish_time":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Yixuan; Meulia, Tea; Gao, Xiang; Saif, Linda J.; Wang, Qiuhong","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/315a9d31f89f90623cc8e059c2d47fc2447c7fbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6321913.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404797/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/2/e01758-18.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01758-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV S","KVHVQ","AEVF","ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV S proteins","Yxx\u03A6 of PEDV S protein","PEDV pathogenicity","KVHVQ motifs","virulence of PEDV","PEDV spike","level of S","conserved motifs Yxx\u03A6","Yxx\u03A6 motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins","motif KVHVQ","attenuated PEDV variants","KKxx motif","intracellular sorting motifs","icPC22A","inactivated motif","intracellular sorting of CoV S proteins","reduced numbers of S protein projections","functional Yxx\u03A6","attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants","neonatal piglets","infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain","tyrosine-based motif YEVF","cell surface","viral pathogenicity","cytoplasmic tail","role","KxHxx","Mutant ic\u039410aa","endocytosis signal","day-old gnotobiotic piglets","ic\u03945aa","CoVs","icYA","study","Infection of Vero cells","ER retrieval signal","severe diarrhea rate","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","design of efficacious live attenuated vaccines","milder intestinal lesions","YEAF","endoplasmic reticulum","high mortality","Golgi intermediate compartment","larger syncytia","virions","mutants","recombinant PEDVs","coronaviruses","ablations","retention","mutations","deletions","ERGIC","results","groups","functions","Y1378A","reverse genetics technology","mock treatment","IMPORTANCE","AEVF","\u0394Yxx\u03A6EKVHVQ","data","Knowledge","\u0394KVHVQ","addition"],"language":"en"},

A PEDV strain was isolated from the piglet intestinal tract in Vero cells in Jiangsu Province, designated as the JS-A strain. PEDV was identified as the isolated virus by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assay, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. The full-length genome of the JS-A isolate and the S gene were systematically analyzed, indicating that PEDV JS-A belongs to the G2a subtype, which is closely related to the prevalent PEDV in many countries and different from many current vaccines. Animal regression tests showed that piglets that are orally infected with the virus continue to develop diarrhea with yellowish and unpleasant odors. Further, piglets showed reduced food consumption and weight loss in the challenged group, while there were no abnormalities in the control group. In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I, and the downstream medium gene in the intestinal mucosa of newborn pigs infected with PEDV JS-A strain were studied. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was the only IgG transport receptor and protected IgG from degradation. Therefore, PEDV JS-A infection might inhibit FcRn expression by down-regulating TLRs and downstream signaling molecules. Taken together, isolation of the JS-A variant contributes to evolutionary analysis of the diarrhea virus. Further, the experimental infection model lays a foundation for further research related to vaccine development and the antiviral natural immune response of infected piglets, which helps us to better understand PEDV pathogenesis and immune mechanism.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Shaoju; Zhang, Weida; Jia, Xiangchao; Sun, Zhijian; Zhang, Yang; Xiao, Yuncai; Li, Zili","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cd6f7eef808b5362ce36f7b92a50cb28238136c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6788300.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV JS","PEDV strain","prevalent PEDV","PEDV pathogenesis","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","isolated virus","TLRs","antiviral natural immune response of infected piglets","piglet intestinal tract","infectious intestinal disease","IgG transport receptor","downstream medium gene","intestinal mucosa of newborn pigs","protected IgG","immune mechanism","evolutionary analysis","sequence analysis","FcRn expression","challenged group","S gene","control group","neonatal Fc receptor","experimental infection model","immunofluorescence assay","western blotting","transmission electron microscopy","weight loss","vaccine development","Vero cells","cytopathology","Jiangsu Province","reduced food consumption","foundation","countries","research","receptors","degradation","variant","current vaccines","Toll","Animal regression tests","unpleasant odors","abnormalities","RIG","full-length genome","addition","isolation","G2a subtype","molecules"],"language":"en"},

Anxiety, is the most common psychological disorder in societies and occupations like nursing, anesthesia technicians and operation room technicians. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence of anxiety, and its severity in Iranian nurses working in operation room. Also, we determined the most important associated factors with anxiety. METHODS: In this cross sectional study, 152 nurses working in operating room participated. The tool to gather the data was a questionnaire, that included three parts; demographic information, obvious anxiety questions and hidden anxiety questions of Spielburger. Obtained data was analysed with SPSS 16 software. RESULTS: The majority of participants were females (94.7%) with experience at work less than 10 years (84.9%). The average scores of participants in obvious and hidden anxiety were 41.9\u00B139.4 (range 20 to 75) and 39.4\u00B18.2 (range 20 to 70), respectively. Anxiety level was significantly higher in females than males (P=0.04). The most prevalent cause of anxiety, was contact with infected biological factors (23% of nurses). The less important cause was concern about retirement (42.8% of nurses). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, anxiety disorders is prevalent in Iranian nurses working in public city hospitals, which warrants immediate programs for intervention to improve working situations in work place.","publish_time":"2013-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kayalha, Hamid; Yazdi, Zohreh; Rastak, Shahram; Dizaniha, Mojtaba","journal":"Glob J Health Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4776884.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5539/gjhs.v5n6p202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24171889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anxiety disorders","Anxiety level","prevalence of anxiety","obvious anxiety questions","prevalent cause of anxiety","hidden anxiety questions of Spielburger","Iranian nurses","working situations","operation room technicians","females","operating room","RESULTS","important cause","data","society","range","important associated factors","anesthesia technicians","majority of participants","work place","cross sectional study","average scores of participants","infected biological factors","occupations","nursing","societies","immediate programs","public city hospitals","demographic information","common psychological disorder","intervention","parts","severity","security of manpower","Health promotion","BACKGROUND","METHODS","experience","retirement","SPSS","software","years","questionnaire","pillars","tool","CONCLUSION","aim"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, seabirds can be long-lived and cross multiple continents within a single annual cycle, thus their exposure to parasites may be greater than other taxa. With changing climatic conditions expected to influence parasite distribution and abundance, understanding current level of infection, transmission pathways and population-level impacts are integral aspects for predicting ecosystem changes, and how climate change will affect seabird species. In particular, a range of micro- and macro-parasites can affect seabird species, including ticks, mites, helminths, viruses and bacteria in gulls, terns, skimmers, skuas, auks and selected phalaropes (Charadriiformes), tropicbirds (Phaethontiformes), penguins (Sphenisciformes), tubenoses (Procellariiformes), cormorants, frigatebirds, boobies, gannets (Suliformes), and pelicans (Pelecaniformes) and marine seaducks and loons (Anseriformes and Gaviiformes). We found that the seabird orders of Charadriiformes and Procellariiformes were most represented in the parasite-seabird literature. While negative effects were reported in seabirds associated with all the parasite groups, most effects have been studied in adults with less information known about how parasites may affect chicks and fledglings. We found studies most often reported on negative effects in seabird hosts during the breeding season, although this is also the time when most seabird research occurs. Many studies report that external factors such as condition of the host, pollution, and environmental conditions can influence the effects of parasites, thus cumulative effects likely play a large role in how parasites influence seabirds at both the individual and population level. With an increased understanding of parasite-host dynamics it is clear that major environmental changes, often those associated with human activities, can directly or indirectly affect the distribution, abundance, or virulence of parasites and pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Junaid S.; Provencher, Jennifer F.; Forbes, Mark R.; Mallory, Mark L.; Lebarbenchon, Camille; McCoy, Karen D.","journal":"Advances in Marine Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0af7c9fd334b408648e2208e5bebd16d3bf02f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172769.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S006528811930001X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S006528811930001X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229148/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.amb.2019.02.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of parasites","negative effects","seabird species","parasites influence seabirds","macro-parasites","virulence of parasites","Abstract Parasites","parasite-seabird literature","cumulative effects","seabird hosts","seabird research","parasite distribution","host species","seabird orders of Charadriiformes","population level","parasite groups","increased understanding of parasite","population-level impacts","host dynamics","Procellariiformes","environmental conditions","abundance","studies","current level of infection","major environmental changes","ecosystem changes","changing climatic conditions","transmission pathways","cross multiple continents","gulls","skuas","bacteria","viruses","terns","skimmers","single annual cycle","auks","integral aspects","mites","large role","marine seaducks","selected phalaropes","loons","Suliformes","gannets","Pelecaniformes","pelicans","helminths","cormorants","frigatebirds","tropicbirds","exposure","ticks","climate change","individual","range of micro-","penguins","Anseriformes","boobies","Sphenisciformes","Phaethontiformes","tubenoses","pollution","external factors","breeding season","Gaviiformes","time","adults"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The three following categories emerged from the interview data: concerns about health, comments on the administration, and attitudes of professionalism. Nurses viewed the human swine influenza as a threat to their personal and families\u2019 health. However, nurses perceived that the severity of the disease was exaggerated by the public. Improvements in planning the circulation of information, allocation of manpower, and utilization of personal protective equipment were indicated. The emergency nurses demonstrated a sense of commitment and professional morale in promoting a high quality of nursing care. DISCUSSION: Various factors affecting the perceptions of emergency nurses toward their professional duties during the influenza pandemic were identified. By understanding these perceptions, appropriate planning, policies, and guidelines can be formulated to meet the healthcare needs of patients during future pandemic outbreaks.","publish_time":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Kam Ki; Hung, Shuk Yu Maria","journal":"Int Emerg Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f37f466c9415ec3548b6b8529ebeaaae71abd819.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118452.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755599X12001000; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ienj.2012.08.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755599X12001000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142054/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["perceptions of emergency nurses","perception of Hong Kong emergency nurses","human swine influenza pandemic outbreak","qualitative study","future pandemic outbreaks","professional morale","professional duties","families\u2019 health","appropriate planning","Qualitative content analysis","utilization of personal protective equipment","work","threat","interview data","allocation of manpower","comments","sense of commitment","regional hospital","healthcare needs of patients","Various factors","face-to-face individual interviews","circulation of information","following categories","high quality of nursing care","administration","concerns","policies","primary aim","guidelines","DISCUSSION","purposive sampling","attitudes of professionalism","disease","INTRODUCTION","Improvements","RESULTS","METHODS","severity","public","transcripts"],"language":"en"},

Their secondary structures are crucial for the RNA functionality, and the prediction of the secondary structures is widely studied. Our previous research shows that cutting long sequences into shorter chunks, predicting secondary structures of the chunks independently using thermodynamic methods, and reconstructing the entire secondary structure from the predicted chunk structures can yield better accuracy than predicting the secondary structure using the RNA sequence as a whole. The chunking, prediction, and reconstruction processes can use different methods and parameters, some of which produce more accurate predictions than others. In this paper, we study the prediction accuracy and efficiency of three different chunking methods using seven popular secondary structure prediction programs that apply to two datasets of RNA with known secondary structures, which include both pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted sequences, as well as a family of viral genome RNAs whose structures have not been predicted before. Our modularized MapReduce framework based on Hadoop allows us to study the problem in a parallel and robust environment. RESULTS: On average, the maximum accuracy retention values are larger than one for our chunking methods and the seven prediction programs over 50 non-pseudoknotted sequences, meaning that the secondary structure predicted using chunking is more similar to the real structure than the secondary structure predicted by using the whole sequence. We observe similar results for the 23 pseudoknotted sequences, except for the NUPACK program using the centered chunking method. The performance analysis for 14 long RNA sequences from the Nodaviridae virus family outlines how the coarse-grained mapping of chunking and predictions in the MapReduce framework exhibits shorter turnaround times for short RNA sequences. However, as the lengths of the RNA sequences increase, the fine-grained mapping can surpass the coarse-grained mapping in performance. CONCLUSIONS: By using our MapReduce framework together with statistical analysis on the accuracy retention results, we observe how the inversion-based chunking methods can outperform predictions using the whole sequence. Our chunk-based approach also enables us to predict secondary structures for very long RNA sequences, which is not feasible with traditional methods alone.","publish_time":"2013-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Boyu; Yehdego, Daniel T; Johnson, Kyle L; Leung, Ming-Ying; Taufer, Michela","journal":"BMC Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be45cd588caaa0d8e5cdcd0cb7a1a59ccfc85d51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3952952.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564983/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6807-13-s1-s3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ribonucleic"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["long RNA sequences","known secondary structures","short RNA sequences","entire secondary structure","long sequences","different chunking methods","popular secondary structure prediction programs","non-pseudoknotted sequences","datasets of RNA","RNA functionality","prediction accuracy","predicted chunk structures","coarse-grained mapping of chunking","different methods","real structure","thermodynamic methods","traditional methods","centered chunking method","accuracy retention results","better accuracy","similar results","modularized MapReduce framework","shorter chunks","maximum accuracy retention values","fine-grained mapping","performance analysis","accurate predictions","chunk-based approach","biological processes","reconstruction processes","statistical analysis","shorter turnaround times","Nodaviridae virus family outlines","family of viral genome RNAs","molecules","important roles","NUPACK program","average","efficiency","gene expression","Ribonucleic acid","problem","regulation","Hadoop","robust environment","BACKGROUND","previous research","parameters","inversion","CONCLUSIONS","paper","lengths"],"language":"en"},

Study design During a 4-month period in the winter season 2006/2007 we collected nasopharyngeal aspirations from children who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics. All samples were examined for 17 agents with real-time PCR. Results HBoV was detected in 45 of 376 samples (12%). The occurrence of HBoV was stable during the study period. Multiple viral infections were present in 78% of the samples (42% double, 20% triple and 16% quadruple infections). RS-virus, enterovirus and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently codetected agents. In samples with a high load for HBoV, significantly fewer multiple infections were found than in the other samples.

In lung, the virus was replicated with the titer lower than that of the trachea, but it rose up more at 5 dpi. The kidneys were the tissues with the least viral genome copy number, although the duration of the virus presence was considerable. The virus replicated in testes sooner than ovaries also disappeared sooner but the maximum viral yield in the ovaries was more. The virus titer in the studied tissues had an interesting fluctuation especially in caecal tonsils. Testes and ovaries were the organs that the virus could reactivate without using any chemical. The most severe lesions were observed in tracheae but they appeared in the lungs later. Lymphocyte infiltration in the kidneys was noted from 5 dpi even sooner than the lungs. There were no lesions in the caecal tonsils, testes and ovaries in spite of the virus replication in a high titer.","publish_time":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammadi, Ali; Asasi, Keramat; Boroomand, Zahra; Namazi, Fatemeh; Hosseinian, Seyedeh Alemeh","journal":"VirusDisease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40d7bf2f2f57aa74f36b081535d501b8c4a90231.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4663706.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13337-015-0286-4.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645044/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13337-015-0286-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus titer","virus replication","virus presence","ovaries","testes","maximum titer","titer lower","high titer","Iranian isolate of avian infectious bronchitis virus IRFIBV32","studied tissues","different tissues","caecal tonsils","kidneys","lungs","maximum viral yield","infected broilers","viral genome","severe lesions","week-old commercial broilers","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","histopathological changes","duration","interesting fluctuation","spite","various days post inoculation","highest IBV RNA level","number","tracheae","organs","Lymphocyte infiltration","ELD50","chemical"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic features of HKU1 infections. Study design Longitudinal, prospective study from November 2005 through May 2006 in a hospitalised patient population. Results Overall, 48/426 (11.3%) patients were found to be infected by hCoV acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). Of these, 10 (19.2%) were caused by HKU1 (6 single infections and 4 coinfections) during the period January\u2013May 2006. Diagnosis was made by using RT-PCR for all four hCoVs, and in parallel, in-house developed group-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for HKU1 and 229E. HKU1-specific MAb was able to retrospectively identify 8 of 10 HKU1 strains detected by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four HKU1 strains were genotype A and six genotype B. In HKU1-infected patients, the predominant clinical symptom was rhinorrhea (nine patients). Within group II hCoV, HKU1-infected patients had a significantly lower rate of lower ARTI compared to OC43-infected patients. Conclusion HKU1 hCoV strains circulated in northern Italy during the winter\u2013spring season 2005\u20132006. Both HKU1 genotypes were detected. HKU1-specific MAb may contribute to the rapid diagnosis of HKU1 infections currently performed by RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2007-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerna, Giuseppe; Percivalle, Elena; Sarasini, Antonella; Campanini, Giulia; Piralla, Antonio; Rovida, Francesca; Genini, Emilia; Marchi, Antonietta; Baldanti, Fausto","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48f372569e276faae0513c70415a25b36be282fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108341.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653206004562; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653206004562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["HKU1 strains","HKU1-infected patients","HKU1 genotypes","HKU1-specific MAb","Conclusion HKU1 hCoV strains","rapid diagnosis of HKU1 infections","diagnostic features of HKU1 infections","OC43-infected patients","single infections","RT-PCR","hCoV acute respiratory tract infections","lower rate of lower ARTI","in-house developed group-specific monoclonal antibodies","prospective study","predominant clinical symptom","Study design Longitudinal","Abstract Background Human respiratory coronavirus","northern Italy","MAbs","winter","hCoVs","rhinorrhea","spring season","time","coinfections","Phylogenetic analysis","hospitalised patient population","Hong Kong","Objective","period","Results"],"language":"en"},

After DNA extraction from stool samples, nested PCR was performed to amplify partial 18S-rDNA and 60 kDa glycoprotein genes of Cryptosporidium. The parasite was detected on all farms. One hundred out of 142 calves (70.4%) were found to be parasitized by Cryptosporidium.

One animal was infected with Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. The prevalence of these species was related to the age of the animal. C. parvum caused 86.7% of Cryptosporidium infections in 5-week-old calves but only 1.7% in 15-week-old animals. The analysis of the results showed that animals could be infected successively by C. parvum, C. ryanae, and C. bovis for the study period.

Two hundred and thirty children (114 male; 187 White, 25 Black; aged 1\u20139.3 years, average = 3.6 \u00B1 1.6 years) were prospectively followed over the typical cold season for cold-like illness and OM. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples collected during cold-like illness and OM were assayed for upper respiratory viruses and buccal samples were assayed for TNF\u03B1 (\u2212308), IL-10(\u22121082, \u2212819, \u2212592), IL-6 (\u2212174) and IFN-\u03B3 (\u002B874) polymorphisms. Logistic regression was used to identify genotypes that predict OM coincident with RSV and rhinovirus (RV) infection. Of the 157 children with RV detection (79 male; 132 White, 13 Black, 12 Other; aged 3.6 \u00B1 1.5 years), simple logistic regression identified age (B = \u22120.34, Z = \u22122.8, P \u003C 0.01, OR = 0.71), IL-6 (B = \u22120.76, Z = \u22123.3, P \u003C 0.01, OR = 0.47) and IL-10 (B = 0.49, Z = 2.0, P = 0.05, OR = 1.6) as significant predictors of OM coincidence. A more complex logistic regression model for RV detection that included selected OM risk factors identified these factors as well as the TNF\u03B1 genotype, OM history, breastfeeding history and daily environment as significant predictors of OM coincidence. Of the 43 children with RSV detection (21 male; 35 White, 5 Black, 3 Other, aged 3.9 \u00B1 1.7 years), logistic regression identified IL-10 (B = 1.05, Z = 2.0, P = 0.05, OR = 2.9) as a significant predictor of OM coincidence. New OM episodes coincident with evidence of RSV and RV infection were significantly more frequent in children with high production IL-10 phenotypes. The low production IL-6 and high production TNF\u03B1 phenotypes also contributed to OM risk during RV detection. Cytokine polymorphisms may be one of an expectedly large number of genetic factors contributing to the known heritability of OM.","publish_time":"2008-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alper, Cuneyt M.; Winther, Birgit; Owen Hendley, J.; Doyle, William J.","journal":"Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aff6763d7348f79c574227b5a8e00611a8d20164.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18560870/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-008-0729-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OM","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OM history","OM coincident","RV detection","significant predictors of OM coincidence","high production IL","significant predictor of OM coincidence","selected OM risk factors","RV infection","children","low production IL","years","New OM episodes coincident","RSV detection","male","simple logistic regression","cytokine production","Black","high production TNF\u03B1 phenotypes","complex logistic regression model","evidence of RSV","illness","TNF\u03B1 genotype","Cytokine polymorphisms","complication rate of viral upper respiratory infection","upper respiratory viruses","typical cold season","breastfeeding history","buccal samples","large number of genetic factors","Nasopharyngeal secretion samples","daily environment","otitis media","vURI","rhinovirus","genotypes","Previous studies","known heritability of","genes","average","IFN-\u03B3"],"language":"en"},

The mortality and morbidity associated with these outbreaks are significant and frequently severe. While aspects of epidemiology, basic virology, etc., may be known, the pathology and pathogenesis are often less so, partly due to a lack of interest among pathologists or because many of these infections are considered \u201Cthird world\u201D diseases. In the study of epidemic viral encephalitis, the pathologist\u2019s role in unravelling the pathology and pathogenesis is critical. The novel henipavirus infection is a good example. The newly created genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae consists of two viruses, viz., Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These two viruses emerged in Australia and Asia, respectively, to cause severe encephalitides in humans and animals. Studies show that the pathological features of the acute encephalitis caused by henipaviruses are similar and a unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and parenchymal cell infection in the CNS (mainly neurons) and other organs causes severe tissue damage. Both viruses can cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection due to a true recurrent infection as evidenced by the presence of virus in infected cells. Future emerging viral encephalitides will no doubt continue to pose considerable challenges to the neuropathologist, and as the West Nile virus outbreak demonstrates, even economically advanced nations are not spared.","publish_time":"2010-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Kum Thong","journal":"Acta Neuropathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed883041a0d3e747865c7854f961ac149cd31690.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20652579/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-010-0720-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["West Nile","CNS"],"locations":["Australia","Asia"],"keyphrases":["acute encephalitis","acute infection","presence of virus","Hendra virus","Nipah virus","study of epidemic viral encephalitis","West Nile virus outbreak","re-emergence of viruses","severe encephalitides","novel henipavirus infection","parenchymal cell infection","henipaviruses","relapsing encephalitis months","true recurrent infection","CNS","pathology","pathogenesis","Future emerging viral encephalitides","severe tissue damage","created genus Henipavirus","induced microinfarction","unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis","central nervous system","doubt","pathologist\u2019s role","family Paramyxoviridae","years","Enterovirus","manifestations","outbreaks","organs","increasing emergence","neuropathologist","good example","pathological features","neurons","aspects of epidemiology","basic virology","morbidity","considerable challenges","infected cells","humans","animals","Asia","advanced nations","pathologists","world","infections","mortality","decades","Studies","Australia","lack","diseases"],"language":"en"},

We determined the interactions between nasopharyngeal microbial pathogens and commensals during viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and acute otitis media (AOM) in infants. METHODS: We analyzed 971 specimens collected monthly and during URI and AOM episodes from 139 infants. The 16S rRNA V4 gene regions were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. RESULTS: Among the high abundant genus-level nasopharyngeal microbiota were Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus (3 otopathogen genera), Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium. Bacterial diversity was lower in culture-positive samples for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, compared to cultured-negative samples. URI frequencies were positively associated with increasing trend in otopathogen colonization. AOM frequencies were associated with decreasing trend in Micrococcus colonization. During URI and AOM, there were increases in abundance of otopathogen genera and decreases in Pseudomonas, Myroides, Yersinia, and Sphingomonas. Otopathogen abundance was increased during symptomatic viral infection, but not during asymptomatic infection. The risk for AOM complicating URI was reduced by increased abundance of Staphylococcus and Sphingobium. CONCLUSION: Otopathogen genera played the key roles in URI and AOM occurrences. Staphylococcus counteracts otopathogens thus Staphylococcal colonization may be beneficial, rather than harmful. While Sphingobium may play a role in preventing AOM complicating URI, the commonly used probiotic Bifidobacterium did not play a significant role during URI or AOM. The role of less common commensals in counteracting the deleterious effects of otopathogens requires further studies.","publish_time":"2017-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Jennings, Kristofer; Golovko, Georgiy; Khanipov, Kamil; Pimenova, Maria; Patel, Janak A.; McCormick, David P.; Loeffelholz, Michael J.; Fofanov, Yuriy","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11d016e4272c8a89fe7986afde61e6fb91908304.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5510840.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28708872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URI","AOM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["URI frequencies","AOM frequencies","AOM occurrences","AOM episodes","Otopathogen abundance","otopathogen colonization","abundance of otopathogen genera","increased abundance of Staphylococcus","symptomatic viral infection","specific commensals","common commensals","asymptomatic infection","Pseudomonas","significant role","Micrococcus colonization","Staphylococcal colonization","infants","Sphingobium","viral upper respiratory tract infection","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","decreasing trend","increasing trend","probiotic Bifidobacterium","nasopharyngeal microbial pathogens","culture-positive samples","cultured-negative samples","high abundant genus-level nasopharyngeal microbiota","key roles","Moraxella","Dolosigranulum","acute otitis media","Interferences","pathogenic bacteria","Acinetobacter","Corynebacterium","S rRNA V4 gene regions","deleterious effects","Myroides","interactions","Bacterial diversity","Illumina MiSeq platform","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Yersinia","specimens","CONCLUSION","Sphingomonas","studies","risk","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

While CoVs are poor inducers of type I IFNs in tissue culture, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the type I IFN response in controlling MHV infection in animals. The protective effectors against MHV infection are, however, still unknown. RESULTS: In order to get more insight into the antiviral gene expression induced in the brains of MHV-infected mice, we performed whole-genome expression profiling. Three different mouse strains, differing in their susceptibility to infection with MHV, were used. In BALB/c mice, which display high viral loads but are able to control the infection, 57 and 121 genes were significantly differentially expressed (\u2265 1.5 fold change) upon infection at 2 and 5 days post infection, respectively. Functional association network analyses demonstrated a strong type I IFN response, with Irf1 and Irf7 as the central players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. Both the type I and II IFN response, which were more pronounced in mice with a higher viral load, were not observed in 129SvEv mice, which are much less susceptible to infection with MHV. 129SvEv mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-), however, were not able to control the infection. Gene expression profiling of these mice identified type I IFN-independent responses to infection, with IFN-\u03B3 as the central player. As the BALB/c and the IFNAR-/- 129SvEv mice demonstrated very similar viral loads in their brains, we also compared their gene expression profiles upon infection with MHV in order to identify type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses. Many known IFN-inducible genes were detected, several of which have previously been shown to play an important protective role against virus infections. We speculate that the additional type I IFN-dependent genes that we discovered may also be important for protection against MHV infection. CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of mice infected with MHV demonstrated the induction of a robust IFN response, which correlated with the viral load. Profiling of IFNAR-/- mice allowed us to identify type I IFN-independent and -dependent responses. Overall, this study broadens our present knowledge of the type I and II IFN-mediated effector responses during CoV infection in vivo.","publish_time":"2009-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raaben, Matthijs; Groot Koerkamp, Marian JA; Rottier, Peter JM; de Haan, Cornelis AM","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0953fa36903063f60627e07f7b4e07f0aec3c4d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2728740.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19650917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","BALB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV infection","CoV infection","role of type","strong type","additional type","IFN-\u03B3","IFN-independent responses","robust IFN response","IFN-dependent genes","SvEv mice","days post infection","c mice","infected mice","IFN-dependent transcriptional responses","brains of MHV","Transcriptional profiling of mice","poor inducers of type","IFN-mediated effector responses","known IFN-inducible genes","Gene expression profiling","Profiling of IFNAR","genome expression profiling","gene expression profiles","antiviral gene expression","high viral loads","similar viral loads","higher viral load","IFNs","important protective role","order","BALB","virus infections","protective effectors","central players","Irf1","Functional association network analyses","Irf7","induction","tissue culture","interferon receptor","studies","insight","susceptibility","coronavirus","importance","present knowledge","CoVs","CONCLUSION","protection","different mouse strains","animals","study","fold change","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It is assumed that antibiotics are efficacious for all bronchiectasis exacerbations, but not all practitioners agree. Inadequately treated exacerbations may risk lung function deterioration. Our study tests the hypothesis that both oral azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are superior to placebo at improving resolution rates of respiratory exacerbations by day 14 in children with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We are conducting a bronchiectasis exacerbation study (BEST), which is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, in five centres (Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Melbourne, Auckland). In the component of BEST presented here, 189 children fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation-concealed) to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (22.5 mg/kg twice daily) with placebo-azithromycin; azithromycin (5 mg/kg daily) with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; or placebo-azithromycin with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 14 days. Clinical data and a paediatric cough-specific quality of life score are obtained at baseline, at the start and resolution of exacerbations, and at day 14. In most children, blood and deep nasal swabs are also collected at the same time points. The primary outcome is the proportion of children whose exacerbations have resolved at day 14. The main secondary outcome is the paediatric cough-specific quality of life score. Other outcomes are time to next exacerbation; requirement for hospitalisation; duration of exacerbation; and spirometry data. Descriptive viral and bacteriological data from nasal samples and blood markers will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Effective, evidence-based management of exacerbations in people with bronchiectasis is clinically important. Yet, there are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the neglected area of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Indeed, no published RCTs addressing the treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbations in children exist. Our multicentre, double-blind RCT is designed to determine if azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, compared with placebo, improve symptom resolution on day 14 in children with acute respiratory exacerbations. Our planned assessment of the predictors of antibiotic response, the role of antibiotic-resistant respiratory pathogens, and whether early treatment with antibiotics affects duration and time to the next exacerbation, are also all novel.

The source and persistence of the infection in humans remains unknown. The aim of this paper was to apply a risk analysis approach to the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and to understand the source of ongoing infections. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV was reviewed and compared to SARS. Each observed feature of MERS-CoV epidemiology was summarized and fitted to either an epidemic or one of two sporadic scenarios (either animal or deliberate release). As of May 2014, MERS-CoV has infected over 681 people and killed a further 204 over 2 years. In contrast, there were 8,273 cases and 775 deaths from SARS within 8 months. MERS-CoV has a more sporadic pattern unlike the clear epidemic pattern seen with SARS, and an unusual concentration of cases in the Middle East, without epidemics in other countries to which it has spread. SARS, with a higher reproductive number (R0), was eliminated from humans within 8 months of emerging, yet MERS-CoV, with a low R0 has persisted in humans over a far more prolonged period. This is at odds with the expected behavior of a virus with a low R0, which theoretically should not persist unless there are ongoing introductions of infection into humans, and poses the question \u201Cwhat is the source of continuing infections in humans?\u201D A hospital outbreak in Al Ahsa, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), had a classic epidemic pattern with some human-to-human transmission. However, 3 different strains were identified in that outbreak, an unexpected and unexplained finding for what appears to be a single source outbreak. Since this outbreak in April 2013, there has been a large increase in new cases, mainly in KSA in April and May 2014, with no corresponding epidemics in other countries. Yet MERS-CoV was present in KSA over several mass gatherings (which predispose to epidemics), including the Hajj pilgrimage, without an epidemic arising. Furthermore, although the virus has been identified in bats and camels, the mode of ongoing transmission to humans remains uncertain. Although some cases appear to be transmitted from human to human, and a few have animal or camel exposure, many cases have no history of contact with either animals or human cases. A high proportion of asymptomatic or otherwise undetected cases have been postulated as an explanation for the unusual epidemiology, yet active surveillance does not support this. When the observed data were fitted to different disease patterns, the features of MERS-CoV fit better with a sporadic pattern, with evidence for either deliberate release or an animal source. There are many discrepancies in the observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV, which better fits a sporadic than an epidemic pattern. Possible explanations of the unusual features of the epidemiology include human-to-human transmission with a large proportion of undetected cases; or sporadic ongoing infections from a non-human source; or a combination of both. Possible sources of ongoing sporadic infection in humans include animals (camels appear the most likely source), or deliberate release. The latter could explain 3 strains being present in a single hospital outbreak. Genetic testing should be conducted to determine whether the virus is evolving to be more transmissible.

Serotherapy reduces GvHD but potentially increases the risk of viral infection by delaying immune reconstitution. Because many PID patients have pre-existing viral infections, the optimal dose of serotherapy is unclear. We performed a retrospective analysis in 34 consecutive PID patients undergoing CBT and compared immune reconstitution, viral infection, GvHD, mortality, and long-term immune function between high-dose (n = 11) and low-dose (n = 9) serotherapy. Serotherapy dose had no effect on neutrophil engraftment. Median CD3\u002B engraftment occurred at 92.5 and 97 days for high- and low-dose serotherapy, respectively. The low-dose serotherapy group had higher CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, and early thymic emigrant counts at 4 months compared with the high-dose group. GvHD severity and number of viral infections did not differ between serotherapy doses. Survival from the transplantation process was 90.9% for high-dose and 100% for low-dose groups.

The turnaround time was about 30 min from sample collection to provision of results. The accuracy was evaluated by assessing the polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) Glu504Lys, which are better known for their critical role in folate and ethanol metabolism, respectively.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-\u03BAB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV induced IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-\u03B2, and TNF-\u03B1 production. TGF-\u03B2-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128\u2013252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF-\u03B2 up-regulated FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Shaoju; Gao, Zitong; Cao, Rui; Yang, Kang; Cui, Yijie; Li, Shaowen; Meng, Xianrong; He, Qigai; Li, Zili","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be5a6b0a0bff9b130578c5ad71a6be32d16525d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6990134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32038538/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulated FcRn expression","TGEV induced FcRn expression","regulation of FcRn expression","role of FcRn","FcRn activation","TGEV N protein","TGEV nucleocapsid","TGEV induced IL","N protein-mediated FcRn","FcRn promoter activity","TGF-\u03B2","intestinal mucosal immunity","NF-\u03BAB","porcine intestinal coronavirus","mucosal surfaces","stimulated IPEC-J2 cells","IgG transport receptor","viral invasion","viral stimulation","IgG transcytosis","small interfering RNAs","neonatal Fc receptor","fatal severe watery diarrhea","treatment","pathway","RIG-","TLR3","TLR9","piglets","central region","JNK-specific inhibitor","molecular mechanism","model pathogen","TNF-\u03B1 production","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","underlying mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

The Lassa and Lujo viruses in the OW complex and the Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Chapare viruses in the NW complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, leading to serious public health concerns. These viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically in order to minimize the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks. However, these arenaviruses are classified as BSL-4 pathogens, thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without BSL-4 facilities. To overcome these difficulties, antibody detection systems in the form of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins (rNPs) derived from these viruses. Furthermore, several antigen-detection assays were developed. For example, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rNPs of Lassa and Junin viruses were generated. Sandwich antigen-capture (Ag-capture) ELISAs using these mAbs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus NPs. These rNP-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of VHFs, but also for seroepidemiological studies on VHFs. We recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins. The goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of VHFs and epidemiological studies on the VHFs caused by arenaviruses.","publish_time":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukushi, Shuetsu; Tani, Hideki; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Saijo, Masayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1d308db379b3c293bcfc8fe251c043fe8842358.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3497043.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202455/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4102097","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sandwich"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed arenavirus neutralization assays","Junin viruses","arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins","genus Arenavirus","Chapare viruses","Lujo viruses","antigen-detection assays","rNP-based assays","capture antibodies","respective arenavirus NPs","scale of arenavirus outbreaks","etiological diagnosis of VHFs","recombinant viral proteins","developing laboratory diagnostic assays","NW complex","recombinant nucleoproteins","mAbs","Ag-capture","based pseudotypes","Sandwich antigen-capture","rNPs of Lassa","BSL","pathogens","arenaviruses","virus infections","diagnostic techniques","New World","Old World","seroepidemiological studies","vesicular stomatitis virus","viral hemorrhagic fever","indirect immunofluorescence assay","novel monoclonal antibodies","antibody detection systems","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","VSV","humans","form","recent advances","ELISAs","institutes","Machupo","Sabia","example","Guanarito","risk","serious public health concerns","independent groups","article","order","difficulties","complexes","potential bioterrorism agents","family Arenaviridae","great importance","facilities","goal"],"language":"en"},

Mitigating such disease threats is challenging, partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches. Serious impacts on susceptible populations most frequently occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant (often domestic) \u201Creservoir\u201D hosts, and spill over into less abundant host species. If this is the case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate. However, pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important, and may not be controllable by managing another host species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated interspecific and intraspecific transmission routes, by comparing African wild dogs\u0027 exposure to six canine pathogens with behavioural measures of their opportunities for contact with domestic dogs and with other wild dogs. Domestic dog contact was associated with exposure to canine parvovirus, Ehrlichia canis, Neospora caninum and perhaps rabies virus, but not with exposure to canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus. Contact with other wild dogs appeared not to increase the risk of exposure to any of the pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings, combined with other data, suggest that management directed at domestic dogs might help to protect wild dog populations from rabies virus, but not from canine distemper virus. However, further analyses are needed to determine the management approaches \u2013 including no intervention \u2013 which are most appropriate for each pathogen.","publish_time":"2012-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woodroffe, Rosie; Prager, Katherine C.; Munson, Linda; Conrad, Patricia A.; Dubovi, Edward J.; Mazet, Jonna A.

Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security. Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed. Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials. Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides. Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the catalytic degradation of complementary mRNAs. As RNA virus infection is predicated on the delivery, replication, and translation of viral RNA, these pathogens present an obvious target for the rapidly advancing field of sequence-specific therapeutics. Antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs can be designed to target the viral RNA genome or viral transcripts. This article reviews current knowledge on therapeutic applications of antisense and RNA interference for highly pathogenic RNA viral infections.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spurgers, Kevin B.; Sharkey, C.

However, studies exploring the ecological interaction between lyssaviruses and their natural hosts are scarce. This study completes our active surveillance work on Spanish bat colonies that began in 1992. Herein, we analyzed ecological factors that might affect the infection dynamics observed in those colonies. Between 2001 and 2011, we collected and tested 2,393 blood samples and 45 dead bats from 25 localities and 20 bat species. The results for dead confirmed the presence of EBLV-1 RNA in six species analyzed (for the first time in Myotis capaccinii). Samples positive for European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1)\u2013neutralizing antibodies were detected in 68% of the localities sampled and in 13 bat species, seven of which were found for the first time (even in Myotis daubentonii, a species to date always linked to EBLV-2). EBLV-1 seroprevalence (20.7%) ranged between 11.1 and 40.2% among bat species and seasonal variation was observed, with significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer (July). EBLV-1 seroprevalence was significantly associated with colony size and species richness. Higher seroprevalence percentages were found in large multispecific colonies, suggesting that intra- and interspecific contacts are major risk factors for EBLV-1 transmission in bat colonies. Although bat-roosting behavior strongly determines EBLV-1 variability, we also found some evidence that bat phylogeny might be involved in bat-species seroprevalence. The results of this study highlight the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding EBLV-1\u2013prevalence patterns in bat colonies and also provide useful information for public health officials.","publish_time":"2013-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Serra-Cobo, Jordi; L\u00F3pez-Roig, Marc; Segu\u00ED, Magdalena; S\u00E1nchez, Luisa Pilar; Nadal, Jacint; Borr\u00E1s, Miquel; Lavenir, Rachel; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b58b4809e706401c8f5851d5b0d2be93b8f431cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3659107.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23700480/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["bat species","bat-species seroprevalence","bat phylogeny","Spanish bat colonies","understanding EBLV","presence of EBLV","European bat lyssavirus","bat-roosting behavior","species richness","large multispecific colonies","Higher seroprevalence percentages","ecological factors","study","dead bats","localities","time","results","major risk factors","higher antibody prevalence","major reservoirs","prevalence patterns","ecological interaction","Samples positive","blood samples","Myotis daubentonii","Myotis capaccinii","diverse emerging infectious viral diseases","importance of life history","rabies","lyssaviruses","roost ecology","interspecific contacts","useful information","active surveillance work","transmission","natural hosts","public health officials","colony size","date","infection dynamics","seasonal variation","best","studies","summer","variability","evidence","RNA","neutralizing antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Similar levels of the anti-S protein IgG response and neutralizing activity were induced by both the S protein and IV vaccines. In addition, immune responses against three other structural proteins, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were also detected in sera of mice that received IV. No antigen-specific T-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-\u03B3 ELISpot assay. Mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with MERS-CoV (1 \u00D7 10(5) plaque-forming units). Compared with the control group (adjuvant alone), mice immunized with the S protein or IV showed slightly lower pathological damage in the lung, as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus titers. Mice that received IV formulations also showed increased protective immunity (almost no live virus was isolated from the lung). In conclusion, our data indicate that immunization with our IV formulation induced enhanced protection in mice compared to immunization with the S protein against MERS-CoV, which should be further tested in camels and clinical trials.","publish_time":"2018-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Yao; Lan, Jiaming; Bao, Linlin; Huang, Baoying; Ye, Fei; Chen, Yingzhu; Yao, Yanfeng; Wang, Wenling; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab8c1e32b66b02cd703799df3d2ee37a1cb369b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5884803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0056-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["IV formulation","vaccinated mice","sera of mice","safe MERS-CoV vaccine","anti-S protein IgG response","final immunization","lung virus titers","vaccine formulation","live virus","structural proteins","combined adjuvant","antigen-specific T-cell immunity","reduced antigen expression","increased protective immunity","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","persistent public health threat of infection","neutralizing activity","enhanced protection","CpG","lower pathological damage","need","Spike","Similar levels","immune responses","envelope","vaccination","alum","formulations","Ad5-hDPP4","interferon-\u03B3 ELISpot assay","membrane","nucleocapsid","data","control group","camels","clinical trials","addition","conclusion","study","vaccines","plaque","units"],"language":"en"},

Recently, a C5a receptor antagonist was shown to suppress neuropathology in two murine models of AD, Tg2576 and 3xTg. Previously, a genetic deficiency of C1q in the Tg2576 mouse model showed an accumulation of fibrillar plaques similar to the complement sufficient Tg2576, but reactive glia were significantly decreased and neuronal integrity was improved suggesting detrimental consequences for complement activation in AD. The goal of this study was to define the role of the classical complement activation pathway in the progression of pathology in the 3xTg mouse that develops tangles in addition to fibrillar plaques (more closely reflecting human AD pathology) and to assess the influence of complement in a model of AD with a higher level of complement hemolytic activity. METHODS: 3xTg mice deficient in C1q (3xTgQ-/-) were generated, and both 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- were backcrossed to the BUB mouse strain which has higher in vitro hemolytic complement activity. Mice were aged and perfused, and brain sections stained for pathological markers or analyzed for proinflammatory marker expression. RESULTS: 3xTgQ-/- mice showed similar amounts of fibrillar amyloid, reactive glia and hyperphosphorylated tau as the C1q-sufficient 3xTg at the ages analyzed. However, 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- on the BUB background developed pathology earlier than on the original 3xTg background, although the presence of C1q had no effect on neuropathological and pro-inflammatory markers. In contrast to that seen in other transgenic models of AD, C1q, C4 and C3 immunoreactivity was undetectable on the plaques of 3xTg in any background, although C3 was associated with reactive astrocytes surrounding the plaques. Importantly, properdin a component of the alternative complement pathway was associated with plaques in all models. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previously investigated transgenic models of AD, development of neuropathology in 3xTg mice, which progresses much slower than other murine models, may not be influenced by fibrillar amyloid mediated activation of the classical complement pathway, suggesting that the alternative complement pathway activation or a C3-independent cleavage of C5 could account for the detrimental effects in these mice that are prevented by the C5a receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the paucity of complement activation may be a factor in the slower kinetics of progression of pathology in the 3xTg model of this disease.","publish_time":"2011-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fonseca, Maria I; Chu, Shu-Hui; Berci, Alisia M; Benoit, Marie E; Peters, Douglas G; Kimura, Yuko; Tenner, Andrea J","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf85ce2e8400011f5119b0eb1a87ffb7933b84a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3033336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21235806/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["xTg background","xTg model","xTg mouse","paucity of complement activation","influence of complement","classical complement activation pathway","alternative complement pathway activation","classical complement pathway","complement sufficient Tg2576","xTg mice deficient","hemolytic complement activity","model of AD","transgenic models of AD","murine models of AD","xTgQ","human AD pathology","C1q-sufficient","activation products","fibrillar amyloid mediated activation","accumulation of fibrillar plaques similar","Tg2576 mouse model","presence of C1q","progression of pathology","BUB background","reactive glia","genetic deficiency of C1q","similar amounts of fibrillar amyloid","C3 immunoreactivity","development of neuropathology","reactive astrocytes","BUB mouse strain","hemolytic activity","C5a receptor antagonist","contrast","slower kinetics of progression","pathological markers","C3-independent cleavage of C5","detrimental consequences","detrimental effects","higher level","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","pro-inflammatory markers","hyperphosphorylated tau","C4","factor","role","tangles","addition","neuronal integrity","brain sections","component","proinflammatory marker expression","properdin","proteins","METHODS","study","goal","ages","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Inflammasomes contribute to both the clearance of the pathogen as well as its pathogenesis \u2013 depending on the amount of inflammation triggered. How respiratory viruses trigger inflammasome activation remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that ion flux is responsible for triggering inflammasome activation in the lung, causing lung pathology and disease exacerbations. Viroporins, encoded by all common respiratory viruses, are responsible for the changes in intracellular ion homeostasis that modulate inflammasome activation.

Symptoms can be unspecific, and an etiologic diagnosis is rarely established because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tools. Improper use of antibiotics is common in this setting, which is detrimental in light of the development of bacterial resistance. It has been suggested that the use of diagnostic tests could reduce antibiotic prescription rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether access to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay panel for etiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) would have an impact on antibiotic prescription rate in primary care clinical settings. METHODS: Adult patients with symptoms of ARTI were prospectively included. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analysed by using a multiplex real-time PCR method targeting thirteen viruses and two bacteria. Patients were recruited at 12 outpatient units from October 2006 through April 2009, and samples were collected on the day of inclusion (initial visit) and after 10 days (follow-up visit). Patients were randomised in an open-label treatment protocol to receive a rapid or delayed result (on the following day or after eight to twelve days). The primary outcome measure was the antibiotic prescription rate at the initial visit, and the secondary outcome was the total antibiotic prescription rate during the study period. RESULTS: A total sample of 447 patients was randomised. Forty-one were excluded, leaving 406 patients for analysis. In the group of patients randomised for a rapid result, 4.5% (9 of 202) of patients received antibiotics at the initial visit, compared to 12.3% (25 of 204) (P = 0.005) of patients in the delayed result group. At follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups: 13.9% (28 of 202) in the rapid result group and 17.2% (35 of 204) in the delayed result group (P = 0.359), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Access to a rapid method for etiologic diagnosis of ARTIs may reduce antibiotic prescription rates at the initial visit in an outpatient setting. To sustain this effect, however, it seems necessary to better define how to follow and manage the patient according to the result of the test, which warrants further investigation.

The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer\u0027s, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer\u0027s, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer\u0027s solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dor\u00E9, V.; Foster, D.

Main Outcome Measures: Willingness to work through difficult scenarios created by an influenza epidemic. RESULTS: The corrected response rate was 22%. The most physicians who responded were willing to continue working through some scenarios caused by a pandemic, but in other circumstances less than 50% would continue. Men were more willing to continue working than women. In some situations South African and British trained physicians were more willing to continue working than other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although many physicians intend to maintain their practices in the event of a pandemic, in some circumstances fewer are willing to work. Pandemic preparation requires ensuring a workforce is available. Healthcare systems must provide frontline healthcare workers with the support and resources they need to enable them to continue providing care.","publish_time":"2013-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dickinson, James A; Bani-Adam, Gisoo; Williamson, Tyler; Berzins, Sandy; Pearce, Craig; Ricketson, Leah; Medd, Emily","journal":"Asia Pac Fam Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70945e1b77b2dd46582a7d73d30746432f209f0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3702417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800113/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1447-056x-12-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["Alberta"],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","Alberta family physicians willingness","Pandemic preparation","frontline healthcare workers","British trained physicians","Effective pandemic responses","Healthcare systems","influenza epidemic","OBJECTIVE","Participants","difficult scenarios","H1N1 epidemic","circumstances fewer","random sample","situations South African","fall wave","support","Main Outcome Measures","RESULTS","corrected response rate","Setting","workforce","resources","practices","region","increased risk","Design","Cross-sectional survey","event","women","groups","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Political leaders and public health officials, desperate for guidance on this once-theoretical scenario, turned to experts including Tom Inglesby, then deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, a bioterrorism research and analysis think tank in Baltimore. In the years that followed, Inglesby and his colleagues ran exercises to simulate bioterror incidents, established a peer-reviewed journal on biodefense and advised government agencies on how to reduce the public health impact of biological threats. Today, he continues his work with the think tank, which moved to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in 2003 (although it stayed headquartered in Baltimore) and which was recently renamed the UPMC Center for Health Security. As director and chief executive officer for the past four years, Inglesby has expanded the center\u0027s focus toward preventing public health crises arising from infectious diseases, pandemics and major natural disasters, in addition to biological, chemical and nuclear accidents or threats. Inglesby spoke with Kevin Jiang about how responses to bioterrorism, pandemics and natural disasters aren\u0027t all that different.","publish_time":"2013-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Nat Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0613-657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23744137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tom Inglesby","Inglesby","Kevin Jiang"],"organizations":["Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies","UPMC Center for Health Security","University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health crises","public health officials","Health Security","UPMC Center","Tom Inglesby","public health impact of biological threats","bioterrorism research","pandemics","years","think tank","Baltimore","Johns Hopkins Center","major natural disasters","deputy director","University of Pittsburgh Medical Center","Civilian Biodefense Strategies","infectious diseases","addition","guidance","center\u0027s focus","peer-reviewed journal","experts","responses","analysis","chief executive officer","US senators","bioterror incidents","nuclear accidents","Political leaders","government agencies","colleagues","exercises","Kevin Jiang","anthrax spores","theoretical scenario","media offices","attacks","national stage","letters","week","work"],"language":"en"},

In bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immune responses against enteric pathogens. This study is aimed at establishing a stable bovine intestinal epithelial cell line that can be maintained by a continuous passage so that studies on innate immune responses against various enteric pathogens can be performed. The main goal was to establish pure cultures of primary and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum and then characterize them biochemically and immunologically. Mixed epithelial and fibroblast bovine ileal intestinal cultures were first established from a 2-day old calf. Limiting dilution method was used to obtain a clone of epithelial cells which was characterized using immunocytochemistry (ICC). The selected clone BIEC-c4 was cytokeratin positive and expressed low levels of vimentin, confirming the epithelial cell phenotype. Early passage BIEC-c4 cells were transfected with either simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen or human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), or human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16E6/E7 genes to establish three immortalized BIEC cell lines. The expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6/E7 genes in immortalized BIECs was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence assays also confirmed the expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6 proteins. The immortalized BIECs were cytokeratin positive and all except HPV-BIECs expressed low levels of vimentin. A growth kinetics study indicated that there were no significant differences in the doubling time of immortalized BIECs as compared to early passage BIEC-c4 cells. All four BIEC types expressed TLR 1-10 genes, with TLR 3 and 4 showing higher expression across all cell types. These newly established early passage and immortalized BIEC cell lines should serve as a good model for studying infectivity, pathogenesis and innate immune responses against enteric pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katwal, Pratik; Thomas, Milton; Uprety, Tirth; Hildreth, Michael B.; Kaushik, Radhey S.","journal":"Cytotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e9141540f932d9e2923c96a9dd27b74985007aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6368510.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600465/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10616-018-0272-y.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10616-018-0272-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BIEC","HPV","TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cells","immortalized BIEC cell lines","HPV-BIECs","clone of epithelial cells","Early passage BIEC-c4 cells","epithelial cell phenotype","BIEC types","stable bovine intestinal epithelial cell line","cell types","doubling time of immortalized BIECs","innate immune responses","hTERT","intestinal epithelium","expression of SV40","selected clone BIEC-c4","established early passage","various enteric pathogens","fibroblast bovine ileal intestinal cultures","E7 genes","continuous passage","HPV E6 proteins","cytokeratin positive","low levels of vimentin","higher expression","immunocytochemistry","human papillomavirus","pure cultures of primary","growth kinetics study","human telomerase reverse transcriptase","large T antigen","pathogenesis","infectivity","important role","type 16E6","studies","simian virus","Toll","major site of interaction","good model","TLRs","significant differences","polymerase chain reaction","receptors","ileum","immunofluorescence assays","PCR","main goal","day old calf","dilution method","ICC"],"language":"en"},

Marine metabolites have been found to inhibit a number of enzymes important in the treatment of human disease. Here, we focus on marine metabolites that inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is the cellular target for treatment of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Currently, development of anticholinesterase drugs with improved potency, and drugs that act as dual acetylcholinesterase and amyloid-\u03B2 aggregation inhibitors, are being sought to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Seven classes of marine metabolites are reported to possess anti-cholinesterase activity. We compared these metabolites to clinically-used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors having known mechanisms of inhibition. We performed a docking simulation and compared them to published experimental data for each metabolite to determine the most likely mechanism of inhibition for each class of marine inhibitor. Our results indicate that several marine metabolites bind to regions of the acetylcholinesterase active site that are not bound by the clinically-used drugs rivastigmine, galanthamine, donepezil, or tacrine. We use the novel poses adopted for computational drug design of tighter binding anticholinesterase drugs likely to act as inhibitors of both acetylcholinesterase activity and amyloid-\u03B2 aggregation inhibition.","publish_time":"2014-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stoddard, Shana V.; Hamann, Mark T.; Wadkins, Randy M.","journal":"Mar Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc2451c2166ef31db7fc2ad93ade6bf4d18c55e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4012451.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/md12042114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classes of marine metabolites","acetylcholinesterase inhibitors","acetylcholinesterase activity","dual acetylcholinesterase","enzyme acetylcholinesterase","acetylcholinesterase active site","class of marine inhibitor","drugs rivastigmine","development of anticholinesterase drugs","amyloid-\u03B2 aggregation inhibitors","amyloid-\u03B2 aggregation inhibition","likely mechanism of inhibition","treatment of human disease","mechanisms of inhibition","stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease","computational drug design of tighter binding anticholinesterase drugs likely","treatment of early","active area of drug discovery","anti-cholinesterase activity","cellular target","improved potency","regions","novel poses","number of enzymes important","galanthamine","donepezil","aquatic ecosystems","experimental data","diversity of biological activities","tacrine","years","results","docking simulation"],"language":"en"},

While the potency of GL against lung inflammatory diseases has been expected, the effect of GL on the lung has been poorly understood. Lung fibroblasts are known as a potent producer of inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and eotaxin 1, by which neutrophils and eosinophils are strongly attracted during inflammation. Therefore, we studied the effects of GL on the production of these chemokines using a human fetal lung fibroblast cell line, HFL-1, stimulated with TNF-\u03B1 and IL-4. Moreover, we examined the structure\u2013activity relationships of GL to explore more beneficial compounds. 18\u03B1,\u03B2-GL inhibited IL-8 dose-dependently and inhibited eotaxin 1 slightly. 18\u03B1,\u03B2-Glycyrrhetic acid (GA) did not inhibit IL-8 but inhibited eotaxin 1. The effect of 18\u03B1,\u03B2-glycyrrhetic acid monoglucuronide (MGA) resembled that of 18\u03B1,\u03B2-GL but was weaker.

We studied the interference between seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses and five other common viruses that cause respiratory illnesses in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017. METHODS: The weekly laboratory-confirmed positive rates of each virus were analyzed from 2014 to 2017 in Hong Kong to describe the epidemiological trends and interference between influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus. A sinusoidal model was established to estimate the peak timing of each virus by phase angle parameters. RESULTS: Seasonal features of the influenza viruses, PIV, enterovirus and adenovirus were obvious, whereas annual peaks of RSV and rhinovirus were not observed. The incidence of the influenza viruses usually peaked in February and July, and the summer peaks in July were generally caused by the H3 subtype of influenza A alone. When influenza viruses were active, other viruses tended to have a low level of activity. The peaks of the influenza viruses were not synchronized. An epidemic of rhinovirus tended to shift the subsequent epidemics of the other viruses. CONCLUSION: The evidence from recent surveillance data in Hong Kong suggests that viral interference during the epidemics of influenza viruses and other common respiratory viruses might affect the timing and duration of subsequent epidemics of a certain or several viruses.","publish_time":"2017-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Xueying; Song, Zhengyu; Li, Yapeng; Zhang, Juanjuan; Wang, Xi-Ling","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2fe2fd6a390f7721c4b38ad8c22389cf0838b96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5732536.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2888-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["common viruses","non-influenza respiratory viruses","seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses","common respiratory viruses","H3 subtype of influenza","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory illnesses","Hong Kong","parainfluenza virus","duration of subsequent epidemics","laboratory surveillance","adenovirus","PIV","viral interference","annual peaks of RSV","enterovirus","epidemic of rhinovirus","summer peaks","weekly laboratory","peak timing","Seasonal features","recent surveillance data","epidemiological trends","evidence","phase angle parameters","positive rates","seasonality","China","resource-limited countries","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","prevalence","low level of activity","METHODS","incidence","BACKGROUND","sinusoidal model"],"language":"en"},

Most probably, the number of URTIs in pregnant women not requiring hospitalization is far larger, but this has yet to be quantified. Clearly, there are logistical barriers to obtaining such statistics. Severe URTI requiring hospitalization during pregnancy was noted to be associated with adverse perinatal complications. URTI was found to be positively correlated with preterm delivery (PTD; less than 37 weeks gestation), lower birth weight, and cesarean deliveries, without a significant effect on the rates of perinatal mortality or low Apgar scores. There appears to be a possible link between various infectious processes that occur during pregnancy and the outcome of a PTD. The inflammatory environment present during infection includes high levels of cytokines that are known to increase prostaglandins, which, in turn, can induce preterm birth.

The activities of these cytokines have been studied extensively in vitro and in rodents, but in vivo studies on the role of these cytokines in infectious diseases of food animals are few. This review concentrates on in vivo studies of cytokine involvement in infectious respiratory diseases of swine, with an emphasis on viral infections. First evidence for the role of early cytokines in pneumonia in swine came from experimental infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The role of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-1 in the symptoms and pathology of porcine pleuropneumonia has recently been proven by use of an adenovirus vector expressing the anti-inflammatory IL-10. In the authors\u2019 laboratory, studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between viral respiratory disease and bioactive lung lavage levels of IFN-\u03B1, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1 and IL-6. Out of three respiratory viruses\u2014porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV)\u2014only SIV induced acute respiratory disease and severe lung damage by itself. Disease and lung pathology were tightly associated with the simultaneous production of IFN-\u03B1, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1 and IL-6. In challenge studies of SIV-vaccinated pigs, levels of IFN-\u03B1, TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6, but not IL-1 were correlated with clinical and virological protection. Multifactorial respiratory disease was reproduced by combined inoculations with PRCV or PRRSV followed by LPS from Escherichia coli. In comparison with the respective single inoculations, which were subclinical, there was a true potentiation of disease and production of TNF-\u03B1, IL-1 and IL-6. TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 were best correlated with disease.

METHOD: Databases were searched for studies investigating VDD and ALRI in children. Independent reviewers assessed the internal validity of the studies. RESULTS: Of 18 studies examined, VDD was found to be associated with increased risk or severity of ALRI in 13 studies; associations were not found in 4 studies. In one study it was found that high maternal vitamin D levels was associated with ALRI in infants. DISCUSSION: Vitamin D supplementation is a low-cost, low-risk intervention that providers should consider for children, especially those at high risk for ALRI. Practitioners should follow current recommendations when prescribing vitamin D supplementation for infants and children.","publish_time":"2014-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larkin, Allison; Lassetter, Jane","journal":"J Pediatr Health Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e26a4f7d8ad71e123ed6bc3094158b640ce9ab6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ded7f5dd0b7f594ad57e3617e2e8c64a6c439945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127565.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2014.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441970/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089152451400279X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089152451400279X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALRI","VDD","Practitioners"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","studies","treatment of ALRI","severity of ALRI","vitamin D supplementation","VDD","vitamin D deficiency","high risk","high maternal vitamin D levels","increased risk","low-risk intervention","infants","current recommendations","Acute lower respiratory infection","diagnosis","prevention","INTRODUCTION","internal validity","providers","years","leading cause of childhood mortality","Common etiologies","Independent reviewers","Databases","Research","DISCUSSION","associations","study","Practitioners","METHOD","purpose","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Using data from the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, we assessed this potential association. METHODS: PERCH is a case-control study in 7 countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. Cases were children aged 1\u201359 months hospitalized with World Health Organization\u2013defined severe or very severe pneumonia. Controls were randomly selected from the community. Microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (MCPP) was confirmed by detection of pneumococcus in a relevant normally sterile body fluid. Colonization density was calculated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens. RESULTS: Median colonization density among 56 cases with MCPP (MCPP cases; 17.28 \u00D7 10(6) copies/mL) exceeded that of cases without MCPP (non-MCPP cases; 0.75 \u00D7 10(6)) and controls (0.60 \u00D7 10(6)) (each P \u003C .001). The optimal density for discriminating MCPP cases from controls using the Youden index was \u003E6.9 log(10) copies/mL; overall, the sensitivity was 64% and the specificity 92%, with variable performance by site. The threshold was lower (\u22654.4 log(10) copies/mL) when MCPP cases were distinguished from controls who received antibiotics before specimen collection. Among the 4035 non-MCPP cases, 500 (12%) had pneumococcal colonization density \u003E6.9 log(10) copies/mL; above this cutoff was associated with alveolar consolidation at chest radiography, very severe pneumonia, oxygen saturation \u003C92%, C-reactive protein \u226540 mg/L, and lack of antibiotic pretreatment (all P\u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal colonization density \u003E6.9 log(10) copies/mL was strongly associated with MCPP and could be used to improve estimates of pneumococcal pneumonia prevalence in childhood pneumonia studies.

Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals. However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 \u00D7 10(9)/L and 1.04 \u00D7 10(9)/L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized. Both conditions require effective prompt actions, especially COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Li-Ru; Chen, Zheng-Xin; Liu, Yang-Chun; Peng, Lei; Zhang, Ye; Xu, Quan; Lin, Qing; Tao, Yun-Ming; Wu, Hao; Yin, Sui; Hu, Ye-Ji","journal":"World J Clin Cases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16da63f04d13396820f4569b023363405214c4e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190958.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i8.1554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest CT","confirmed COVID","chest tightness","CT findings","lower posterior chest","calcaneal fracture","chest computed tomography","pelvic fracture","CASE SUMMARY","present case","thoracic spinal fracture","pulmonary contusion","lymphocyte count","Differential diagnosis of lung contusion","human transmission","lung contusions","obvious characteristics of human","white blood cell count","dullness","sides","T12","major public health emergency","moist rales","proper management of patients","fall injury","foot pain","percussion","nausea","physical examination","cough","difficult breathing","end of inspiration","backache","Early identification","year-old woman","CONCLUSION","effective prompt actions","Features","patchy ground-glass opacity","conservative treatment","hospitalization","conditions","diarrhea","infective asymptomatic carriers","fever","BACKGROUND","Coronavirus disease","previous shadows","day","lungs","auscultation","review","residence","infected individuals"],"language":"en"},

Governments too, since some diseases\u2019 high prevalence affect the economic output of society. Yet the decisions as to which drugs will be developed are strictly in private hands. The risks required to treat some really important, and often increasingly prevalent, diseases mean that the desires of society and the industry are diverging. This is not boding well for our society. The understanding and willingness of governments to step in as a partner and financier is not apparent. Will governments recognize their role in this? Since the economic cost of these diseases, in terms of reduced productivity and medical costs to treat the disease, is enormous, understanding should be forthcoming. Government has invested for many decades in an enormous program of cancer research, which now shows dividends. The importance of further government investment in basic research is apparent when industry does not want to or cannot anymore afford it. As Big Pharma drops out of important therapeutic areas, it is not promising to assume that government can step in to the vacancy. There has to be a serious effort to find a formula by which the government gently or not so gently forces the industry to continue its efforts because it is so important. Perhaps the most important of these neglected diseases is Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) because of its dehumanizing nature and its predictably massively increasing prevalence. Yet, none of the currently approved Alzheimer drugs can be used to prevent, cure, or even significantly slow the progression of this disease. It is predicted that by 2030 50% of the over 80s will have the disease. Almost 100% of people with an inheritable trait will develop the disease unless we succeed in finding a preventive therapy. Only recently has a preventive trial been announced. It is often thought that insulin-dependent diabetes is a well-treated disease and needs no further diagnostic and drug development efforts. This could not be further from the truth. The long-term complications of insulin-treated diabetes add to the economic burden, especially as the growth in prevalence of the disease expands with the waistlines of the world\u2019s population. Three hundred million may have type 2 diabetes by 2030. Pharmaceutical control of weight loss has so far been vexed by serious side effects. When it comes to diabetes drugs, we start to recognize that the control of blood glucose can be further improved; the biggest contribution is not by drugs, but by self-diagnosis with point of care glucose measuring devices. Morphine is still the most effective medicine against pain. It has been around for 5,000 years and we haven\u2019t come up with anything better. But it can be ineffective against neuropathic pain and cancer pain. New pain medicines are difficult to find because of the subjective measurement and poor animal models. Since many current pain killers are abused, there are other hurdles. Despite the many difficulties, society needs new pain killers at the same time that notable pharma are pulling out, despite the economic opportunity. Drugs against cancer have had many high-profile and expensive failures in recent years, with all major companies having at least one failed candidate. Biotech companies have made much progress, however, and they are either collaborating with or being taken over by Big Pharma. Oncology drug development has been crucially enabled by decades of government investment. The key is the many characterized drug targets that other disease areas do not have. Government intervention in oncology and HIV provide the model for treatment of AD, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia, among other therapeutic areas. Increasing governmental direct funding of translational research is not the solution many hope it will be.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartfai, Tamas; Lees, Graham V","journal":"The Future of Drug Discovery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4e09f74aaef372e1d8e33b049de26b0eaa236b8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124071803000052; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124071803000052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Pharma"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease areas","cancer pain","neuropathic pain","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","important diseases","diabetes drugs","industry","well-treated disease","new pain killers","Government intervention","New pain medicines","current pain killers","economic output of society","decades of government investment","important therapeutic areas","treated diabetes","desires of society","Abstract Society","approved Alzheimer drugs","neglected diseases","economic burden","economic cost","economic opportunity","Big Pharma","insulin-dependent diabetes","Oncology drug development","drug development efforts","enormous program of cancer research","basic research","notable pharma","understanding","willingness of governments","characterized drug targets","diseases\u2019 high prevalence","provider of approved medicine","control of blood glucose","treatment of AD","major companies","recent years","Biotech companies","effective medicine","serious effort","preventive therapy","preventive trial","governmental direct funding of translational research","point of care glucose","long-term complications of insulin","Pharmaceutical control of weight loss","terms of reduced productivity","subjective measurement","medical costs","HIV","time","schizophrenia","diagnostic","expensive failures","poor animal models","self-diagnosis","growth","difficulties","failed candidate","devices","key","partner","waistlines","inheritable trait","dehumanizing nature","formula","importance","world\u2019s population","people","Morphine","financier","solution","biggest contribution","dividends","private hands","effects","role","type","decisions","risks","vacancy","progression","hurdles","cure","truth"],"language":"en"},

While the COVID-19 pandemic has already had far-reaching socioeconomic consequences commonly associated with natural hazards (such as disruption to society, economic damage, and loss of lives), the response of governments around the world has been unparalleled and unlike anything seen before. Governments are faced with a myriad of multi-dimensional effects of the pandemic, including direct impacts on public health systems and population health and indirect socioeconomic effects including disruption to every single sector of the economy and mass unemployment. There is, additionally, the growing realisation that the timescale associated with this crisis may permanently change the very foundations of societies \u2018normal\u2019 day-to-day life. As the world transitions to recovering from COVID-19, those developing that recovery need support in adjusting and improving their policies and measures. The situation seems dire, the stakes are high. Literature about the transition between the response and recovery phase in relation to pandemics is scarce. Further complication is that the pandemic will not allow countries to simply transition to the full-scale recovery, instead, a rebound from recovery to response phase is expected for a certain period until the immunization is in place. Pandemics indeed force us to think beyond typical emergency management structures; the cycles of the disaster risk management in the case of biological and other natural hazards are not exactly the same and no one-size-fits-all approach may be used. Still, some parallels may be drawn with the efforts to combat natural hazards and some lessons may be used from previous and the current pandemic. Based on these experiences and reflections, this paper provides a set of policy directions to be considered during the transition towards, as well as throughout, this transition phase. It is suggested that meeting this global, multi-dimensional, and complex challenge will require considerable international collaboration (even convention) and macro-scale changes to global and national policies. The recovery issues are mainly going to be dominated by politics, economics and social science. Necessary for an effective recovery, the pandemic response needs to be a holistic response, combined with an improved data ecosystem between the public health system and the community. We should also view this outbreak and our response to it as an opportunity to learn lessons and reaffirm our universal commitment to sustainable development and enhancing wellbeing around the world.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fakhruddin, Bapon; Blanchard, Kevin; Ragupathy, Durga","journal":"Progress in Disaster Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5527da8828e8f874ca24d3e67f4c61484d63c4c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100102; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590061720300399?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590061720300399","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic response","response phase","recovery phase","response of governments","holistic response","effective recovery","full-scale recovery","recovery issues","transition phase","natural hazards","current pandemic","COVID","recovery need support","population health","public health systems","disruption","lessons","pandemics","world transitions","myriad of multi-dimensional effects","indirect socioeconomic effects","national policies","far-reaching socioeconomic consequences","disaster risk management","typical emergency management structures","cycles","complex challenge","convention","macro-scale changes","single sector","direct impacts","improved data ecosystem","considerable international collaboration","case of biological","paper","economic damage","society","loss of lives","relation","rebound","sustainable development","universal commitment","foundations of societies","economy","novel coronavirus","wellbeing","certain period","set of policy directions","day-to-day life","mass unemployment","rapid spread","timescale","stakes","politics","economics","social science","reflections","immunization","force","community","efforts","corner","size-fits","approach","growing realisation","situation","crisis","place","experiences","countries","opportunity","Literature","Abstract","planet","parallels","measures","complication","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

Not much is known about the formation of these vesicles, although recent observations indicate an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication complexes (RCs). We now show that MHV replication is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA). Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1, known to mimic the action of the drug, inhibited MHV infection profoundly. Immunofluorescence analysis and quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA did not block the formation of RCs per se, but rather reduced their number. MHV RNA replication was not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which are known to express the BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Accordingly, individual knockdown of the Golgi-resident targets of BFA by transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed that GBF1, but not BIG1 or BIG2, was critically involved in MHV RNA replication. ARF1, the cellular effector of GBF1, also appeared to be involved in MHV replication, as siRNAs targeting this small GTPase inhibited MHV infection significantly. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication and reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication complex formation are closely connected.","publish_time":"2008-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verheije, Monique H.; Raaben, Matthijs; Mari, Muriel; te Lintelo, Eddie G.; Reggiori, Fulvio; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

Over the years, it has been proposed that HCoVs play a possible role in gastrointestinal infections. Objectives To assess the role of HCoVs in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. Study design Study was conducted at Tampere University Hospital over 2 years. Both stool and nasal swab samples were collected from 172 children with AGE, 545 with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and 238 with symptoms of both. The samples were tested for HCoVs by RT-PCR. Results HCoVs were detected in 52 (5.4%) children: in 6.4% of those with AGE, 4.4% with ARTI and 7.1% with symptoms of both. HCoVs OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 were encountered in 13, 11, 13 and 15 cases, respectively. HCoVs were detected simultaneously in stool and nasal swab samples in 17 children, in nasal swabs alone in 33 children, and in the stools alone in two children. HCoVs were present in the stools of eight (4.7%) of the 172 children with AGE; in six of these cases, the nasal swab sample was also positive for the respective HCoV. Additionally, in six of the eight cases, the stool sample contained either rotavirus or calicivirus. Conclusions HCoVs can be detected in the stools of children with AGE, but usually together with well-known gastroenteritis viruses, and concomitantly in the respiratory tract. It appears that commonly circulating HCoVs do not have a significant role in the AGE of children admitted to hospital.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paloniemi, Minna; Lappalainen, Suvi; Vesikari, Timo","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d619e85f7e4e5ba75378c1dab680300264e793db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106540.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.10.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214004041; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214004041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464968/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":["Tampere University Hospital"],"keyphrases":["AGE of children","role of HCoVs","HCoVs OC43","stools of children","circulating HCoVs","Results HCoVs","Conclusions HCoVs","nasal swab samples","cases","stool sample","nasal swabs","HKU1","acute gastroenteritis","significant role","acute respiratory tract infection","possible role","NL63","ARTI","years","symptoms","common causes of respiratory infections","Study design Study","gastrointestinal infections","Tampere University Hospital","well-known gastroenteritis viruses","Abstract Background Human coronaviruses","rotavirus","calicivirus","respective HCoV","RT-PCR","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Macrolides have frequently been used in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the association of macrolides with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (CoV) RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS. Methods This retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort database included 14 tertiary-care hospitals in five cities in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to determine the association of macrolide therapy with 90-day mortality, and the Cox-proportional hazard model to determine the association of macrolide therapy with MERS-CoV RNA clearance. Results Of 349 critically ill MERS patients, 136 (39%) received macrolide therapy. Azithromycin was most commonly used (97/136; 71.3%). Macrolide therapy was commonly started before the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) (51/136; 37.5%), or on day1 in ICU (53/136; 39%). On admission to ICU, the baseline characteristics of patients who received and did not receive macrolides were similar, including demographic data and sequential organ failure assessment score. However, patients who received macrolides were more likely to be admitted with community-acquired MERS (P =0.02). Macrolide therapy was not independently associated with a significant difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] :0.47\u20131.51; P =0.56) or MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR: 0.88; 95% CI:0.47\u20131.64; P =0.68). Conclusions These findings indicate that macrolide therapy is not associated with a reduction in 90-day mortality or improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arabi, Yaseen M.; Deeb, Ahmad M.; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Mandourah, Yasser; Almekhlafi, Ghaleb A.; Sindi, Anees A.; Al-Omari, Awad; Shalhoub, Sarah; Mady, Ahmed; Alraddadi, Basem; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M.; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Ragab, Ahmad; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Kharaba, Ayman; Jose, Jesna; Dabbagh, Tarek; Fowler, Robert A.; Balkhy, Hanan H.; Merson, Laura; Hayden, Frederick G.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bae0b01b4d54ed9f2a304ada45d10d4738688bf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110878.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971219300529; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219300529; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.01.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","ICU"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["ill MERS patients","MERS-CoV RNA clearance","association of macrolide therapy","MERS coronavirus","day mortality","ill patients","association of macrolides","ICU","baseline characteristics of patients","Abstract Objectives Macrolides","retrospective analysis","adjusted HR","tertiary-care hospitals","intensive care unit","adjusted odds ratio","Multivariate logistic-regression analysis","demographic data","multicenter cohort database","sequential organ failure assessment score","improvement","viral pneumonia","cities","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Cox-proportional hazard model","influenza","improved outcomes","Saudi Arabia","viruses","Methods","admission","significant difference","community","Conclusions","findings","Results","reduction","immune-modulatory effects","confidence interval","study","day1","Azithromycin"],"language":"en"},

The major mutation detected to date in the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope spike protein, which is responsible for virus attachment to the host and is also the main target for host antibodies, is a mutation of an aspartate (D) at position 614 found frequently in Chinese strains to a glycine (G). We sought to infer health impact of this mutation. RESULT Increased case fatality rate correlated strongly with the proportion of viruses bearing G614 on a country by country basis. The amino acid at position 614 occurs at an internal protein interface of the viral spike, and the presence of G at this position was calculated to destabilize a specific conformation of the viral spike, within which the key host receptor binding site is more accessible. CONCLUSION These results imply that G614 is a more pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2, which may influence vaccine design. The prevalence of this form of the virus should also be included in epidemiologic models predicting the COVID-19 health burden and fatality over time in specific regions. Physicians should be aware of this characteristic of the virus to anticipate the clinical course of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Becerra-Flores, Manuel; Cardozo, Timothy","journal":"International journal of clinical practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32374903/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13525","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral spike","SARS-CoV","position","virus attachment","viral envelope spike protein","host antibodies","G614","major mutation","pathogenic strain of SARS","health burden","specific regions","specific conformation","country basis","presence of G","COVID pandemic","health impact","key host receptor binding site","internal protein interface","clinical course of infection","Increased case fatality rate","time","Chinese strains","main target","date","proportion of viruses","glycine","characteristic","epidemiologic models","aspartate","Physicians","CONCLUSION","results","amino acid","prevalence","vaccine design"],"language":"en"},

However, the nature of the TREM\u20101 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM\u20101 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM\u20101. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti\u2010arthritic activity of a novel, ligand\u2010independent TREM\u20101 inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that was rationally designed using the signalling chain homo oligomerization (SCHOOL) model of cell signalling. Free GF9 and GF9 bound to macrophage\u2010targeted nanoparticles that mimic human high\u2010density lipoproteins (GF9\u2010HDL) were used to treat collagen\u2010induced arthritis (CIA). We also tested if 31\u2010mer peptides with sequences from GF9 and helices 4 (GE31) and 6 (GA31) of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein A\u2010I, are able to perform three functions: assist in the self\u2010assembly of GA/E31\u2010HDL, target these particles to macrophages and block TREM\u20101 signalling. We showed that GF9, but not control peptide, ameliorated CIA and protected against bone and cartilage damage.

We report the isolation and identification of a genome type HAdV-7d (DG01_2011) from a recent outbreak in Southern China. Genome sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) comparisons with past pathogens indicate HAdV-7d has re-emerged in Southern China after an absence of twenty-one years. Recombination analysis reveals this genome differs from the 1950s-era prototype and vaccine strains by a lateral gene transfer, substituting the coding region for the L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein from HAdV-16. DG01_2011 descends from both a strain circulating in Southwestern China (2010) and a strain from Shaanxi causing a fatality and outbreak (Northwestern China; 2009). Due to the higher morbidity and mortality rates associated with HAdV-7, the surveillance, identification, and characterization of these strains in population-dense China by REA and/or whole genome sequencing are strongly indicated.

Objectives To characterize the role of CoV in respiratory tract infections among HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients. Study design We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of CoV infection documented by polymerase chain reaction, (PCR)-based testing on nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples between June 2010 and 2013. Cases of CoV infection occurring in HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients were identified and the clinical characteristics of these cases were compared to other respiratory viruses. Results CoV was identified in 2.6% (n =43) of all samples analyzed (n =1661) and in 6.8% of all samples testing positive for a respiratory virus (n =631). 33 of 38 (86.8%) of patients in whom CoV was identified were HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients. Among these patients, CoV was detected in 9.7% of unique infection episodes, with only rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV/EnV) infection being more common. Group I CoV subtypes accounted for 76.3% of cases, and 57% of infections were diagnosed between December and March. CoV infection was associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms in most patients, similar to other respiratory viruses. Possible and proven lower respiratory tract disease was less common compared to other respiratory viruses except RhV/EnV. Conclusions CoV is frequently detected in HSCT and hematologic malignancy patients in whom suspicion for a respiratory viral infection exists, but is less likely to progress to lower respiratory tract disease than most other respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hakki, Morgan; Rattray, Rogan M.; Press, Richard D.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/432a9661e8c0a00f31e4e276a808a0a47860bbb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106547.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26071326/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001249; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001249","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","RhV/EnV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","cases of CoV infection","respiratory viral infection","respiratory tract infections","hematologic malignancy patients","role of CoV","CoV subtypes","Conclusions CoV","Results CoV","HSCT","upper respiratory tract symptoms","proven lower respiratory tract disease","unique infection episodes","hematologic malignancies","EnV","RhV","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples","based testing","clinical characteristics","clinical impact of coronavirus","PCR","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","rhinovirus","polymerase chain reaction","retrospective review","enterovirus","Study design","Abstract Background","Group","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein.

Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was applied for industrial broiler flocks.

Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic\u2019s epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65\u201381 cases (upper bounds: 169\u2013507) in Guangdong and an additional 44\u2013354 (upper bounds: 141\u2013875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.","publish_time":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roosa, Kimberlyn; Lee, Yiseul; Luo, Ruiyan; Kirpich, Alexander; Rothenberg, Richard; Hyman, James M.; Yan, Ping; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073898.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32098289/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020596","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission"],"locations":["China","Zhejiang","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["Zhejiang","day forecasts","cumulative case data","Guangdong","short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases","sub-epidemic model predictions","sub-epidemic wave model","Richards growth model","cumulative case reports","generalized logistic growth model","current data","case definition","outbreaks","upper bounds","Limited epidemiological data","validated phenomenological models","sustained transmission","National Health Commission of China","recent changes","potential","social distancing measures","Chinese government","best-case scenario","different infectious diseases","understanding","extinction","ongoing COVID","epidemic\u2019s epicenter","impact","provinces"],"language":"en"},

Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model, the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed, a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases. Considering the spread of disease in different populations, the model combines population density, sex ratio, and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model. Finally, on the basis of the SLIRDS model, the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated.

Hence, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are promptly needed. In this study we report an epitope, ITLCFTLKR, which is biochemically fit to HLA allelic proteins. We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0\u20131 \u00C5. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC(50) values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected. This new methodology of epitope-based vaccine prediction is fundamental and fast in application, ad can be economically beneficial and viable.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joshi, Amit; Joshi, Bhuwan Chandra; Mannan, M.

Although this may also be the result of the disease per se, increasing evidence suggests a role for miR\u2010223 in limiting inflammation to prevent collateral damage during infection and in preventing oncogenic myeloid transformation. Validated targets for miR\u2010223 that have effects on inflammation and infection include granzyme B, IKK\u03B1, Roquin and STAT3. With regard to cancer, validated targets include C/EBP\u03B2, E2F1, FOXO1 and NFI\u2010A. The effect of miR\u2010223 on these targets has been documented individually; however, it is more likely that miR\u2010223 affects multiple targets simultaneously for key processes where the microRNA is important. Such processes include haematopoietic cell differentiation, particularly towards the granulocyte lineage (where miR\u2010223 is abundant) and as cells progress down the myeloid lineage (where miR\u2010223 expression decreases). NF\u2010\u03BAB and the NLRP3 inflammasome are important inflammatory mechanisms that are dampened by miR\u2010223 in these cell types. The miRNA can also directly target viruses such as HIV, leading to synergistic effects during infection.

Preventing future allergic reactions in patients who have already developed a systemic reaction is based on the correct management of the acute phase of the reaction followed by a correct diagnosis and, where indicated, prescription of adrenaline autoinjectors and VIT. A possible strategy to optimize care processes and to improve outcomes is the implementation of a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Care Pathways, also known as Integrated Care Pathways or Clinical Pathways (CPWs). The aim of the care pathway is to enhance the quality of care by improving risk\u2010adjusted patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources. To our knowledge, currently in Italy as well as in Europe, there is no CPWs codified for the management of HVA patients. This paper describes the development of the clinical content of a care pathway for the management of HVA. METHODS: The methodology applied is based on the eight step method to build the clinical content of an evidence-based care pathway suggested by Lodewijckx et al. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventeen different clinical activities were extracted from the selected literature. The expert panel was involved in their evaluation, expressing a judgment of relevance through the Delphi study. As a result, 126 clinical activities were appraised to be valid and feasible. The final recommendations (126) were translated into 123 key interventions. Six indicators were produced by the clinical activities. CONCLUSION: A set of 123 key interventions and of six process indicators were found to be appropriate for the development and standardization of the clinical content of the Hymenoptera venom allergy care pathway.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bil\u00F2, Maria Beatrice; Corsi, Alice; Pravettoni, Valerio; Bignardi, Donatella; Bonadonna, Patrizia; Quercia, Oliviero; Mauro, Marina; Novembre, Elio; Micheletti, Rebecca; Papa, Roberto","journal":"Clin Transl Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/188b1ecf98fbd20b23fab6140760d976a5ab120b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7055031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hymenoptera"],"organizations":["VIT","Therapeutic Care Pathways","Integrated Care Pathways","Clinical Pathways","HVA"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["clinical content","Clinical Pathways","care processes","quality of care","Integrated Care Pathways","Therapeutic Care Pathways","evidence-based care pathway","different clinical activities","Hymenoptera venom allergy care pathway","management of HVA patients","correct management","patient safety","adjusted patient outcomes","patient satisfaction","development","CPWs","key interventions","correct diagnosis","systemic reaction","process indicators","underestimated condition","Diagnostic","risk","important cause of morbidity","evaluation","judgment of relevance","acute phase","implementation","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","standardization","Lodewijckx","prescription of adrenaline autoinjectors","Delphi study","mortality","future allergic reactions","set","possible strategy","step method","selected literature","Italy","expert panel","use of resources","CONCLUSION","Europe","paper","aim","METHODS","methodology","final recommendations","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to explore major microbial trends in burn patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at burn wards and intensive care units, where burn patients were admitted following an event of dust explosion. Data were collected for a number of variables including severity of burns, demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic devices. RESULTS: A total of 1132 specimens were collected from 37 hospitalized burn patients with mean TBSA of 46.1%.The most commonly isolated species were Staphylococcus spp. (22.4%). The highest rate of antibiotic resistance was observed in carbapenem\u2013resistant A. baumannii (14.6%), followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (11.3%). For each additional 10% TBSA, the isolation of MDRO increased 2.58\u201317.57 times (p \u003C 0.05); for each additional 10% of the third-degree burn severity, the risk of MDRO significantly decreased by 47% (95% CI, 0.38\u20130.73, p \u003C 0.001) by Cox model.

Here, we show that formulation of Combo5 with adjuvants containing saponin QS21 significantly improves protective efficacy, even though all 7 adjuvants tested generated high antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, including alum. Detailed characterization of Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant, a squalene-in-water emulsion containing a TLR4 agonist and QS21, showed significant differences from the results obtained with alum in IgG subclasses generated following immunization, with an absence of GAS opsonizing antibodies. SMQ, but not alum, generated strong interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-\u03B3), and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-\u03B1) responses.

The 24-form Tai Chi may exert a protective function for CHD patients after PCI by improving anxiety and depression. METHODS: Patients who received PCI after 1\u20134 days were randomly assigned to the 24-form Tai Chi group (TG) and the control group (CG). The differences in anxiety and depression, using the Medical Outcomes Study 36\u2212item Short\u2212Form Health Survey (SF-36), before and after an average of 10 months of Tai Chi intervention were compared in both groups to analyze the effects of Tai Chi on the emotion and the life quality of CHD patients. Meanwhile, the relative levels of miR-17-92 were measured by using real-time qPCR. The association between the relative levels of miR-17-92 and the anxiety and the depression of CHD patients after PCI was analyzed. Adjusted Cox models were used to explore the effect of Tai Chi exercise in CHD patients. RESULTS: After 10 months of intervention, the changes in the anxiety subscale (P = 0.002), in the depression subscale (P = 0.008), and in the stress (P = 0.015) scores were higher in the TG group when compared to those of the CG group. The proportion of anxious (P = 0.045) and depressed subjects (P = 0.042) in the TG group was lower than that in the CG group. On the other hand, the increase in the SF-36 scores and in the relative levels of miR-17-92 was significantly higher in the TG group when compared with that of the CG group (P \u003C 0.05). The serum level of miR-17-92 had a negative correlation with the anxiety, the depression, and the stress scores (P \u003C 0.01).

In previous studies, we showed that a SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein-based modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) vaccine could induce strong neutralizing antibody (Nab) response which might have played a critical role in protecting Chinese rhesus monkeys from the pathogenic viral challenge. To date, however, it remains unknown what the minimal level of Nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans. It is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of Nab response in vivo. Here, we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of DNA-S, MVA-S, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5-S) vaccines. We show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits, a heterologous MVA-S prime with Ad5-S boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of Nab response when compared with other combinations. Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the magnitude of the secondary response after the boost. Thus, our data provides a promising optimal regimen for vaccine development in humans against SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2007-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ba, Lei; Yi, Christopher E.; Zhang, Linqi; Ho, David D.; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e46ae0414399709f36d00a9bff2ec3b362784bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079952.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079952/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["heterologous MVA-S prime","Ad5-S boost regimen","SARS-CoV spike","SARS-CoV infection","secondary response","persistent level","minimal level","initial level","humans","vaccine development","combinations of DNA","promising optimal regimen","Chinese rhesus monkeys","glycoprotein","modified vaccinia Ankara","rabbits","pathogenic viral challenge","adenovirus type","strong neutralizing antibody","critical role","various vaccination regimens","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","vaccinated mice","novel coronavirus","data","magnitude","sterile immunity","techniques","vaccines","previous studies","date"],"language":"en"},

Viral fusion occurs either with the plasma membrane for pH-independent viruses, or with the endosomal membranes for pH-dependent viruses. Although, viral fusion proteins are parted in three classes and the subcellular localization of fusion might vary, these proteins have to act, in common, on lipid assemblies.

In addition, we determined if greater EtCO(2)level fluctuations during resuscitation occurred in infants who developed IVH. EtCO(2) levels during delivery suite resuscitation and CO(2) levels on the neonatal unit were evaluated in 58 infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks). Delta EtCO(2) was the difference between the highest and lowest level of EtCO(2). Thirteen infants developed a grade 3\u20134 IVH (severe group). There were no significant differences in CO(2) levels between those who did and did not develop an IVH (or severe IVH) on the NICU.

Providing quality care service of neonatal resuscitation reduces neonatal mortality. However, challenges to providing quality neonatal resuscitation are not well investigated in Ethiopia. Hence, this study is conducted to assess the quality provision of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia. METHOD: We used data from the Ethiopian 2016 Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care survey, conducted in 3804 health facilities providing maternal and newborn health services. We described the quality of neonatal resuscitation services according to the structure, process and outcome triad of quality dimension. Data from registers and birth records for the last 12 months prior to the survey were extracted. In each facility, the three last eligible charts of resuscitated neonates were reviewed and the highest frequency of chart of resuscitated baby was considered to the analysis. Thus, a total of 555 charts were assessed. Logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between the neonatal resuscitation processes, provider, facility and newborn characteristics with neonatal outcome at the time of discharge. RESULTS: The finding suggested that, around two-third, 364(65.6%) of the asphyxiated babies resuscitated by bag and mask type of neonatal resuscitation. Of the babies who had got neonatal resuscitation 463 (83.4%) survived. Resuscitated neonates with a gestational age of greater than 37 weeks and above (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =1.82; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.09\u20133.04)), availability of priority equipment in health facilities for neonatal resuscitation (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.09, 1.54)) and women who had 12 h and less duration of labor (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI (1.23, 3.13)) were the independent factors of survival of the neonate. CONCLUSION: Only half of the health facilities were ready for neonatal resuscitation (NR) in terms of priority equipment\u2019s. However, eight out of ten babies survived after NR in Ethiopia. Gestational age, priority equipment for NR and duration of labor were determinants of survival of resuscitated neonates in Ethiopia. Therefore, the availability of priority equipment and attentive care and follow-up for premature neonates and those face prolonged labor need to be improved in Ethiopia.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weldearegay, Haftom Gebrehiwot; Abrha, Mulugeta Woldu; Hilawe, Esayas Haregot; Gebrekidan, Brhane Ayele; Medhanyie, Araya Abrha","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46d50d5594951811f2621e7a969d4b2e34fbba5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NR"],"locations":["Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["quality neonatal resuscitation","neonatal resuscitation processes","quality of neonatal resuscitation services","neonatal outcome","quality provision of neonatal resuscitation","neonatal mortality","quality care service of neonatal resuscitation","mask type of neonatal resuscitation","Ethiopia","health facilities","newborn health services","NR","availability of priority equipment","eligible charts of resuscitated neonates","resuscitated baby","AOR","premature neonates","newborn characteristics","duration of labor","outcome triad of quality dimension","Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care survey","attentive care","facility","quarter newborn deaths","terms of priority equipment\u2019s","data","asphyxiated babies","face prolonged labor","gestational age of greater","determinants of survival","birth records","Birth asphyxia accounts","independent factors of survival","follow-up","weeks","bag","structure","provider","highest frequency of chart","Adjusted Odds Ratio","half","relationship","time of discharge","BACKGROUND","registers","months","challenges","Logistic regression model","Confidence Interval","women","CONCLUSION","analysis","RESULTS","finding","total","METHOD","study"],"language":"en"},

The study group consisted of 120 children aged 6 to 144 months with AOM. Middle ear fluid (MEF) was tested for viral pathogens by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and for bacteria by gram-staining and culture. Clinical response was assessed on day 2 to 4, 11 to 13, 26 to 28. Respiratory viruses were isolated in 39 patients (32.5%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (46.5%) was the most common virus identified in MEF samples, followed by human rhinovirus (HRV) (25.6%), human coronavirus (HCV) (11.6%), influenza (IV) type A (9.3%), adenovirus type sub type A (AV) (4%), and parainfluenza (PIV) type -3 (2%) by RT-PCR. In total 69 bacterial species were isolated from 65 (54.8%) of 120 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) was the most frequently isolated bacteria. Viral RNA was detected in 31 (56.3%) of 55 bacteria-negative specimens and in 8 (12.3%) of 65 bacteria-positive MEF samples. No significant differences were found between children representing viral infection alone, combined viral and bacterial infection, bacterial infection alone, and neither viral nor bacterial infection, regarding clinical cure, relapse and reinfection rates. A significantly higher rate of secretory otitis media (SOM) was observed in alone or combined RSV infection with S. pneumonia or Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) than in other viruses infection. Conclusion. This study provides information about etiologic agents and diagnosis of AOM in Turkish children.

Pigs (n = 3) were euthanized for pathologic examination at post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and the remainder were monitored for clinical signs, virus shedding, and serum antibody responses until PID 28. All inoculated pigs developed watery diarrhea and/or vomiting at PID 1-2 and shed the highest amount of viral RNA in feces at PID 3-5, accompanied by severe atrophic enteritis. They developed high titers of PDCoV-specific IgG/IgA and virus-neutralizing antibodies in serum at PID 23-24. Histologic lesions were limited to the villous epithelium of the jejunum and ileum at PID 3. Two inoculated pigs tested at PID 23-24 had small to moderate numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells in the intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes, but not in enterocytes. An analysis of full-length S and N genes of TC- and Gn-pig-passaged OH-FD22 revealed a high genetic stability in cell culture and pigs. TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 (cell passages 5, 20 and 40) was enteropathogenic, and the pathogenicity was similar to that of the original field virus. The TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 will be useful for further pathogenesis studies and for evaluating if higher-level cell-culture passaged virus becomes attenuated for vaccine development.","publish_time":"2016-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hui; Jung, Kwonil; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afa5cab2abb47553a3f1e904c7706dba6022bd2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087098.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PID","TC-PDCoV OH-FD22","PDCoV strain OH-FD22","passaged OH-FD22","cell culture","inoculated pigs","high titers of PDCoV","cell passages","higher-level cell-culture","cell line","virus shedding","moderate numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells","LLC-PK cells","N genes of TC","LLC porcine kidney","tissue-culture","original field virus","pathogenicity","Gn-pig","Porcine deltacoronavirus","high genetic stability","serum antibody responses","novel enteropathogenic coronavirus","intestinal lamina propria","specific IgG","mesenteric lymph nodes","post-inoculation day","IgA","analysis of full-length S","villous epithelium","pathologic examination","clinical signs","pathogenesis studies","viral RNA","feces","jejunum","ileum","antibodies","vaccine development","day-old gnotobiotic","watery diarrhea","remainder","Histologic lesions","severe atrophic enteritis","enterocytes","study"],"language":"en"},

The folding of the capsid protein was studied by determination of the antigenic pattern of chimeric capsid proteins, composed of regions from RHDV and EBHSV capsid proteins. The anti-RHDV monoclonal antibody (MAb) E3, which is known to bind an external conformational epitope, recognized the RHDV C-terminal region. The anti-RHDV MAb A47, which binds a buried epitope, recognized the RHDV N-terminal region. Using a pGEX expression library, we more precisely mapped the MAb A47 epitope on a 31 residues length peptide, between residue 129 and 160 of the VP60, confirming its location in the N-terminal part of the protein. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal part of the protein is accessible to the exterior whereas the N-terminal domain of the protein constitutes the internal shell domain of the particle. With the aim of using virus-like particles (VLPs) of RHDV as epitope carriers or DNA transfer vectors, we produced in the baculovirus system three proteins, \u0394N1, \u0394N2 and \u0394N3, truncated at the N terminus. The \u0394N1 protein assembled into VLPs, demonstrating that the first 42 amino acid residues are not essential for capsid assembly. In contrast, \u0394N2, from which the first 75 residues were missing, was unable to form VLPs. The small particles obtained with the \u0394N3 protein lacking residues 31 to 93, located in the immunodominant region of the RHDV capsid protein, indicate that up to 62 amino acid residues can be eliminated without preventing assembly.","publish_time":"2014-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laurent, S.; Kut, E.; Remy-Delaunay, S.; Rasschaert, D.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41bec71f8b85bd04579dfae148da786be27fb223.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087155/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzgwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RHDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RHDV capsid protein","RHDV N-terminal region","RHDV C-terminal region","\u0394N3 protein","\u0394N1 protein","anti-RHDV MAb A47","N-terminal domain","capsid assembly","EBHSV capsid proteins","anti-RHDV monoclonal antibody","MAb A47 epitope","amino acid residues","VLPs","epitope carriers","buried epitope","N terminus","residues length peptide","antigenic pattern of chimeric capsid proteins","external conformational epitope","immunodominant region","\u0394N2","Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus","small particles","European brown hare syndrome virus","internal shell domain","regions","caliciviruses","DNA transfer vectors","determination","baculovirus system","E3","severe symptoms","location","pGEX expression library","VP60","aim","results","folding","hares","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The nucleolus is present during interphase in mammalian cells and is the site of ribosome biogenesis, and has been implicated in controlling regulatory processes such as the cell cycle. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and its antigens; viral proteins co-localise with factors such as nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin, and can cause their redistribution during infection. Viruses can use these components as part of their replication process, and also use the nucleolus as a site of replication itself. Many of these properties are not restricted to any particular type of virus or replication mechanism, and examples of these processes can be found in DNA, RNA and retroviruses. Evidence suggests that viruses may target the nucleolus and its components to favour viral transcription, translation and perhaps alter the cell cycle in order to promote virus replication. Autoimmunity to nucleolin and fibrillarin have been associated with a number of diseases, and by targeting the nucleolus and displacing nucleolar antigens, virus infection might play a role in the initiation of these conditions.","publish_time":"2014-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hiscox, J.

Two hundred fourteen nasopharyngeal samples from hospitalised children were tested for the presence of viruses using cell culture and PCR and/or viral antigen assays. The results revealed a parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1) outbreak that ended right before the onset of the influenza season, with nearly no overlapping, moderate respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity, and only a few adenoviruses. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was present in 14.5% of the total samples but was detected in combination with other viruses in only five cases: with PIV1 in three cases and with RSV in two cases. There were no cases of dual infection with hMPV and flu or adenovirus. This suggests that hMPV alone is a leading cause of hospitalisation in children under 1 year of age. Interestingly, hMPV, in contrast to RSV, coincided with PIV1 but was absent during the community outbreak of the flu. Samples were also tested for Mimiviridae, a group of newly described DNA viruses that are similar to Legionella spp., replicate in water amoebae, and also have been found in alveolar cells. However, mimivirus was detected neither in respiratory samples nor in amoebae-containing water samples, indicating that this particular type of virus is either not abundant or does not contribute to paediatric respiratory illnesses.","publish_time":"2006-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larcher, C.; Jeller, V.; Fischer, H.; Huemer, H.

It argues that there are at least two critical reasons for the past, present and easily anticipated future failings of the global public health regime.

They also allow the survival, growth and transmission of bacteria such as Legionella, Mycobacteria and Vibrio species in water systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in hospital water networks in Johannesburg, South Africa. A total of 178 water (n = 95) and swab (n = 83) samples were collected from two hospital water distribution systems. FLA were isolated using the amoebal enrichment technique and identified using PCR and 18S rDNA sequencing. Amoebae potentially containing intra-amoebal bacteria were lysed and cultured on blood agar plates. Bacterial isolates were characterized using the VITEK\u00AE2 compact System. Free-living amoebae were isolated from 77 (43.3 %) of the samples. Using microscopy, PCR and 18S rRNA sequencing, Acanthamoeba spp. (T3 and T20 genotypes), Vermamoeba vermiformis and Naegleria gruberi specie were identified. The Acanthamoeba T3 and T20 genotypes have been implicated in eye and central nervous system infections. The most commonly detected bacterial species were Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Delftia acidovorans, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Comamonas testosteroni. These nosocomial pathogenic bacteria are associated with systematic blood, respiratory tract, the urinary tract, surgical wounds and soft tissues infections. The detection of FLA and their associated opportunistic bacteria in the hospital water systems point out to a potential health risk to immune-compromised individuals.

The present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of two novel reoviruses isolated from Muscovy ducklings in Guangdong, China. RESULTS: Two novel MDRV strains, designated as MDRV-SH12 and MDRV-DH13, were isolated from two diseased Muscovy ducklings in Guangdong province, China in June 2012 and September 2013, respectively. Sequencing of the complete genomes of these two viruses showed that they consisted of 23,418 bp and were divided into 10 segments, ranging from 1191 bp (S4) to 3959 bp (L1) in length, and all segments contained conserved sequences in the 5\u2032 non-coding region (GCUUUU) and 3\u2032 non-coding region (UCAUC). Pairwise sequence comparisons demonstrated that MDRV-SH12 and MDRV-DH13 showed the highest similarity with novel MDRVs. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of all 10 segments revealed that MDRV-SH12 and MDRV-DH13 were clustered together with other novel waterfowl-origin reoviruses and were distinct from classical waterfowl-origin and chicken-origin reoviruses. The analyses also showed possible genetic re-assortment events in segment M2 between waterfowl-origin and chicken-origin reoviruses and the segments encoding \u03BBA, \u03BCA, \u03BCNS, \u03C3A, and \u03C3NS between classical and novel waterfowl-origin reoviruses. Potential recombination events detection in segment S2 suggests that MDRV-SH12 and MDRV-DH13 may be recombinants of classical and novel WRVs. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this study, the full genomic data for two novel MDRV strains, will improve our understanding of the evolutionary relationships among the waterfowl-origin reoviruses circulating in China, and may aid in the development of more effective vaccines against various waterfowl-origin reoviruses.

ALI and in particular ARDS, are usually accompanied by refractory hypoxemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. In most cases, an exaggerated inflammatory and pro-thrombotic reaction to an initial stimulus, such as systemic infection, elicits disruption of the alveolo-capillary membrane and vascular fluid leak. The pulmonary endothelium is a major metabolic organ promoting adequate pulmonary and systemic vascular homeostasis, and a main target of circulating cells and humoral mediators under injury; pulmonary endothelium is therefore critically involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. In this review we will discuss mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and edema generation in the lung with special emphasis on the interplay between the endothelium, the immune and hemostatic systems, and highlight how these principles apply in the context of defined disorders and specific insults implicated in ALI pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maniatis, Nikolaos A.; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Catravas, John D.; Orfanos, Stylianos E.","journal":"Vascular Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd8448251f371435b51a7fa9506c85e8f162bf48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110599.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537189108000852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722553/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vph.2008.06.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1537189108000852","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary endothelium","variety of pulmonary","permeability pulmonary edema","pathogenesis of ALI","ALI pathogenesis","systemic insults","mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction","systemic vascular homeostasis","systemic infection","Abstract Acute lung injury","edema generation","specific insults","particular ARDS","vascular fluid leak","acute respiratory distress syndrome","humoral mediators","major metabolic organ","main target of circulating cells","pro-thrombotic reaction","alveolo-capillary membrane","initial stimulus","disruption","context of defined disorders","special emphasis","interplay","need","refractory hypoxemia","mechanical ventilation","hemostatic systems","principles","cases","review"],"language":"en"},

Lack of knowledge of the magnitude of the problem hinders the allocation of appropriate resources for NIS prevention and management. We used benefit-cost analysis embedded in a Monte-Carlo simulation model and analysed economic and environmental impacts of NIS in the region to estimate the total burden of NIS in Southeast Asia. The total annual loss caused by NIS to agriculture, human health and the environment in Southeast Asia is estimated to be US$33.5 billion (5(th) and 95(th) percentile US$25.8\u201339.8 billion). Losses and costs to the agricultural sector are estimated to be nearly 90% of the total (US$23.4\u201333.9 billion), while the annual costs associated with human health and the environment are US$1.85 billion (US$1.4\u20132.5 billion) and US$2.1 billion (US$0.9\u20133.3 billion), respectively, although these estimates are based on conservative assumptions.

In 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for an unknown emerging illness, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in more than 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. Since then, we have witnessed the emergence of several other viral respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8; variant influenza A H3N2 virus), human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In response, various surveillance systems have been developed to monitor the emergence of respiratory-tract infections. These include systems based on identification of syndromes, web-based systems, systems that gather health data from health facilities (such as emergency departments and family doctors), and systems that rely on self-reporting by patients. More effective national, regional, and international surveillance systems are required to enable rapid identification of emerging respiratory epidemics, diseases with epidemic potential, their specific microbial cause, origin, mode of acquisition, and transmission dynamics.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Zumla, Alimuddin; Gautret, Philippe; Gray, Gregory C; Hui, David S; Al-Rabeeah, Abdullah A; Memish, Ziad A","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abf7526308d07bb5fd96d27c8a21bdabf1622914.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106459.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309914708400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189347/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309914708400; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(14)70840-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["emergence of respiratory","viral respiratory pathogens","international surveillance systems","various surveillance systems","web-based systems","severe acute respiratory syndrome","rapid identification of emerging respiratory epidemics","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","new viral respiratory tract infectious diseases","epidemic potential","influenza viruses","variant influenza","health facilities","health data","SARS-CoV","avian influenza H5N1","global health security","identification of syndromes","novel coronavirus","tract infections","MERS-CoV","worldwide alert","unknown emerging illness","H10N8","H7N9","specific microbial cause","mode of acquisition","H3N2 virus","origin","human adenovirus","emergency departments","Summary","countries","family doctors","substantial economic impact","transmission dynamics","self-reporting","response","deaths","patients","cases","years"],"language":"en"},

However, determining a pathogen\u2019s transmission dynamics is complicated by challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. After demonstrating the robustness of the method using simulation studies, we apply the new method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program from 1982-1986 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our results provide estimates of the reproductive number and spillover rate of monkeypox during this surveillance period and suggest that most human-to-human transmission events occur over distances of 30km or less. Taking advantage of contact-tracing data available for a subset of monkeypox cases, we find that around 80% of contact-traced links could be correctly recovered from transmission trees inferred using only date and location. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate spatial scale of transmission, and show how even imperfect spatiotemporal data can be incorporated into models to obtain reliable estimates of human-to-human transmission patterns. Surveillance datasets are often the only sources of information about the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases. Methods that can extract as much information as possible from these datasets therefore provide a key advantage for informing our understanding of the disease dynamics and improving our ability to choose the optimal intervention strategy. We developed and tested a likelihood-based inference method based on a mechanistic model of the spillover and human-to-human transmission processes. We first used simulated datasets to explore which information about the disease dynamics of a subcritical zoonotic pathogen could be successfully extracted from a line-list surveillance dataset with non-localized spatial information and unknown geographic coverage. We then applied the method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1982 and 1986 to obtain estimates of the reproductive number, spillover rate, and spatial dispersal of monkeypox in humans.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ambrose, Monique R.; Kucharski, Adam J.; Formenty, Pierre; Muyembe-Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Rimoin, Anne W.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/624ef69bb48a69c4435705ed2c2542c4a6988371.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8aa021696a6accab9053f1d779eef6710439bfa5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/677021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Democratic Republic","Congo"],"keyphrases":["human transmission events","human transmission patterns","human transmission processes","transmission of zoonotic pathogens","zoonotic disease surveillance","dataset of human monkeypox cases","Surveillance datasets","transmission trees","reliable estimates of human","pathogens capable of transmission","pathogen\u2019s transmission dynamics","spatial model","surveillance period","appropriate spatial scale of transmission","unobserved sources of transmission","spatial dispersal of monkeypox","active surveillance program","subcritical zoonotic pathogens","sources of information","spillover rate of monkeypox","unknown scope of surveillance","model-based inference method","non-localized spatial information","subset of monkeypox cases","line-list surveillance dataset","new method","disease dynamics","likelihood-based inference method","epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases","challenges","mechanistic model","reproductive number","Democratic Republic","advantage of contact","humans","Congo","simulated datasets","results","understanding","key advantage","tracing data available","unknown geographic coverage","imperfect spatiotemporal data","contact-traced links","ecology","public health responses","ability","models","simulation studies","importance","optimal intervention strategy","robustness","date","DRC","levels of mixing","distances","location","work","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Although HRV-induced upper respiratory illness is often mild and self-limiting, the socioeconomic impact caused by missed school or work is enormous and the degree of inappropriate antibiotic use is significant. It has been estimated that upper respiratory disease accounts for at least 25 million absences from work and 23 million absences of school annually in the United States [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003.

Increasing evidences also describe the link between HRV infection and more serious medical complications. HRV-induced colds are the important predisposing factors to acute otitis media, sinusitis, and are the major factors in the induction of exacerbations of asthma in adults and children. HRV infections are also associated with lower respiratory tract syndromes in individuals with cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, and other underlying respiratory disorders [Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., 2003.

To date, no effective antiviral therapies have been approved for either the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by HRV infection. Thus, there still exists a significant unmet medical need to find agents that can shorten the duration of HRV-induced illness, lessen the severity of symptoms, minimize secondary bacterial infections and exacerbations of underlying disease and reduce virus transmission.

Our surveillance data in the ICU revealed that intubated patients were at eight times higher risk of acquiring MRSA than non-intubated patients, so we hypothesised that pre-emptive contact precautions for all intubated patients would prevent healthcare-associated infection by MRSA in the ICU. Patients staying in our ICU for \u003E2 days were included in this study. The study period was divided into two periods. During 2004 (1st period), contact precautions were performed only for patients with MRSA. During 2005\u20132007 (2nd period), contact precautions were applied to all intubated patients regardless of MRSA infection status. Patients were defined as MRSA-positive on admission when MRSA was detected by surveillance or clinical culture on enrolment. Other MRSA-positive results were defined as healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) transmission. HA-MRSA infection was diagnosed according to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance Manual. The 1st period comprised 415 patients, and the 2nd period comprised 1280 patients. In intubated patients, HA-MRSA infection rate decreased significantly in the 2nd period (1st period 12.2%, 2nd period 5.6%; P =0.015).

School closure (also called class dismissal in North America) is a non-pharmaceutical intervention that is commonly suggested for mitigating influenza pandemics. Health officials taking the decision to close schools must weigh the potential health benefits of reducing transmission and thus case numbers against high economic and social costs, difficult ethical issues, and the possible disruption of key services such as health care. Also, if schools are expected to close as a deliberate policy option, or just because of high levels of staff absenteeism, it is important to plan to mitigate the negative features of closure. In this context, there is still debate about if, when, and how school closure policy should be used. In this Review, we take a multidisciplinary and holistic perspective and review the multiple aspects of school closure as a public health policy. Implications for the mitigation of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1 pandemic are also discussed.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M; Wachtel, Claude; Tegnell, Anders; Saour, Guillaume; Duncan, Ben; Nicoll, Angus","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/469d2702c9ac28d511d9f921432ef44e83a07723.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106429.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309909701768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19628172/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(09)70176-8; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309909701768","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["health officials","school closure policy","health care","public health policy","potential health benefits","multiple aspects of school closure","phase","influenza pandemic alert level","H1N1 pandemic","pandemic mitigation protocols","negative features of closure","close schools","Review","swine-origin influenza","mitigating influenza pandemics","deliberate policy option","high levels of staff absenteeism","social costs","difficult ethical issues","case numbers","transmission","North America","possible disruption of key services","class dismissal","world","non-pharmaceutical intervention","holistic perspective","decision","response","Implications","Summary","context"],"language":"en"},

Conventional detection methods may be misleading and do not provide rapid results allowing for immediate action. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method has proven to be an effective tool to detect and quantify microorganisms in water within a few hours. Quantitative PCR assays have recently been developed for the detection of specific adeno- and polyomaviruses, bacteria and protozoa in different water sources. The technique is highly sensitive and able to detect low numbers of microorganisms. Quantitative PCR can be applied for microbial source tracking in water sources, to determine the efficiency of water and wastewater treatment plants and act as a tool for risk assessment. Different qPCR assays exist depending on whether an internal control is used or whether measurements are taken at the end of the PCR reaction (end-point qPCR) or in the exponential phase (real-time qPCR). Fluorescent probes are used in the PCR reaction to hybridise within the target sequence to generate a signal and, together with specialised systems, quantify the amount of PCR product. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) is a more sensitive technique that detects low copy number RNA and can be applied to detect, e.g. enteric viruses and viable microorganisms in water, and measure specific gene expression. There is, however, a need to standardise qPCR protocols if this technique is to be used as an analytical diagnostic tool for routine monitoring. This review focuses on the application of qPCR in the detection of microorganisms in water.","publish_time":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Botes, Marelize; de Kwaadsteniet, Mich\u00E9le; Cloete, Thomas Eugene","journal":"Anal Bioanal Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10ee080308e7ee4e7e6223c75f4666b096e469e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079929.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23001336/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-012-6399-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR reaction","efficiency of water","detection of microorganisms","Quantitative PCR assays","different water sources","real-time qPCR","qPCR protocols","application of qPCR","PCR product","Different qPCR assays","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","viable microorganisms","occurrence of microorganisms","low numbers of microorganisms","sensitive technique","Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","end","detection of specific adeno","effective tool","analytical diagnostic tool","Conventional detection methods","health risk","risk assessment","internal control","specific gene expression","low copy number RNA","bacteria","polyomaviruses","q-RT","wastewater treatment plants","protozoa","microbial source tracking","contamination","signal","rapid results","routine monitoring","enteric viruses","exponential phase","target sequence","immediate action","measurements","specialised systems","Fluorescent probes","necessity","need","review","hours"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rehman, Saif ur; Shafique, Laiba; Ihsan, Awais; Liu, Qingyou","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157669.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9030240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32210130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging virus SARS-CoV","different genomic regions of SARS","descendant of Bat SARS","different evolutionary strategies","recombination regions","novel virus","crucial strategies","virus reproductive adaptability","evolutionary ancestors","mutations","evolutionary survival","combined natural selected strategies","putative recombination patterns","spike glycoproteins","natural reservoir","human society","human host","novel infectious agent","genotype adjustment","outbreaks of coronaviruses","specific influence","way","animals","membrane","CoVs","elevated morbidity rates","adaptations","RdRp","helicase","S gene","bats","global community","immune reconnaissance","changing environments","superficial antigenicity","ORF3a","world","nucleocapsid","time","genome analysis","current study","decades","Betacoronavirus"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is underestimated. Meteorological variations and air pollution are likely to play a role in these infections. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the number of emergency visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and to evaluate the association between ILI/SARI, RVI prevalence, and meteorological factors/air pollution, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, from November 2008 to October 2010. METHODS: Eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-three hospitalizations (adults and children) for respiratory symptoms were correlated with meteorological parameters and air pollutants. In a subset of adults, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and analyzed through IFI test. The data were analyzed using time-series analysis. RESULTS: Influenza-like illness and SARI were diagnosed in 3698 (30\u00B79%) and 2063 (17\u00B77%) patients, respectively. Thirty-seven (9\u00B70%) samples were positive by IFI and 93 of 410 (22\u00B77%) were IFI and/or PCR positive. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IFI positivity was statistically associated with absolute humidity, use of air conditioning, and presence of mold in home. Sunshine duration was significantly associated with the frequency of ILI cases. For SARI cases, the variables mean temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity, and mean concentration of pollutants were singnificant. CONCLUSIONS: At least 22% of infections in adult patients admitted to ER with respiratory complaints were caused by RVI. The correlations among meteorological variables, air pollution, ILI/SARI cases, and respiratory viruses demonstrated the relevance of climate factors as significant underlying contributors to the prevalence of RVI.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, Denise R; Viana, Vin\u00EDcius P; M\u00FCller, Alice M; Livi, Fernando P; Dalcin, Paulo de Tarso R","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4f6cfb312bae60aa35168d4a775bdb90c4bc39c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4177797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24034701/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12158","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI/SARI","IFI","SARI","RVI"],"locations":["Porto Alegre","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["air pollution","respiratory symptoms","respiratory complaints","prevalence of respiratory viruses","Respiratory viral infections","SARI cases","air pollutants","common causes of respiratory infections","meteorological factors","meteorological variables","air conditioning","RVI prevalence","prevalence of RVI","frequency of ILI cases","meteorological parameters","severe acute respiratory infection","Meteorological variations","IFI positivity","IFI test","illness","influenza","Sunshine duration","subset of adults","OBJECTIVES","mean concentration of pollutants","relative humidity","absolute humidity","adult patients","PCR positive","relevance of climate factors","temperature","significant underlying contributors","RVIs","multivariate logistic regression model","number of emergency visits","city of Porto Alegre","presence of mold","children","BACKGROUND","correlations","association","nasopharyngeal aspirates","Brazil","study","singnificant","role","time-series analysis","data","home","hospitalizations","RESULTS","samples","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cong, Yu; Hart, Brit J.; Gross, Robin; Zhou, Huanying; Frieman, Matthew; Bollinger, Laura; Wada, Jiro; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Dyall, Julie; Holbrook, Michael R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5864050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566060/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV replication","primary cells","MDMs","MERS treatment","strong anti-MERS-CoV activity","established cells","Immature MDDCs","dendritic cells","primary antigen","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","high cytotoxicity","antiviral activity of well-defined drugs","antiviral effect","marginal activity","innate antiviral response","high apparent cytotoxicity","high virulence","established cell lines","chlorpromazine","chloroquine","immortalized cell lines","primary human monocyte-derived macrophages","potential window","role of APCs","clinical studies","drug utilization","severe respiratory disease","value of testing drugs","drug screen assays","robust protective immune response","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","humans","chemokines","addition","public health","stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine","chemokine upregulation","induction of inflammatory cytokines","importance","case fatality rate","emerging threat","pathogenesis","toremifene","compounds","results","therapeutic option","study"],"language":"en"},

Among the widely used dsRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs have evolved as extremely powerful and the most popular gene silencing reagents. The key challenge to achieving efficient gene silencing especially for the purpose of therapeutics is mainly dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the selected RNAi-targeted sequences. Practically, only a small number of dsRNAs are capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specific gene silencing via RNAi mechanism. In addition, the efficiency of gene silencing induced by dsRNAs can only be experimentally examined based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is essential to develop a fully robust and comparative validation system for measuring the efficacy of designed dsRNAs. In this chapter, we focus our discussion on a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that has been previously established in our laboratory. The system consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expressions. The efficiency of siRNAs is determined by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporters with easily quantified readouts including enhanced green fluorescence protein and firefly luciferase. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this reliable and efficient reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective RNAi-targeted sequences from mammalian genes but also implicates the use of RNAi-based dsRNA reagents for reverse functional genomics and molecular therapeutics.","publish_time":"2013-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Wen-Hui; Chang, Wen-Tsan","journal":"Gene Function Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24233788/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-721-1_15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient gene silencing","efficiency of gene silencing","RNAi mechanism","use of RNAi","sequence-specific gene silencing","popular gene silencing reagents","conserved mechanism of gene silencing","efficient reporter-based siRNA validation system","target gene expression","effective RNAi-targeted sequences","quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system","selected RNAi-targeted sequences","comparative validation system","small number of dsRNAs","based dsRNA reagents","short hairpin RNAs","efficacy of designed dsRNAs","available short synthetic DNA fragment","small interfering RNAs","expression vectors","efficiency of siRNAs","triggering siRNA expressions","double-stranded RNAs","powerful strategy","molecular therapeutics","purpose of therapeutics","targeting reporters","enhanced green fluorescence protein","reverse functional genomics","quantified readouts","screening","mammalian genes","firefly luciferase","effectiveness","specificity","discussion","key challenge","abilities","inhibition","addition","RNA interference","chapter","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

The reason is that in recent decades, infectious diseases such as HIV/SIDA, SARS and Influenza have shown that we need new approaches and concepts in order to understand how biological emergencies and health alerts deploy new scales of action. Especially relevant has been the case of A(H1N1) influenza. This reached the status of global threat virtually from its onset, triggering an international response with a diffusion, visibility and rapidity unparalleled in previous health alerts. This article maintains that this global condition cannot be explained solely by the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease, such as mortality rate, severe cases, propagation capacity, etc. Resorting to the approach proposed by the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this paper suggests that the action of certain socio-technical operators was what built a heterogeneous network of ideas, concepts and materials that turned the A (H1N1) influenza into a global-scale phenomenon with unprecedented speed. Among these operators, the most important ones were: the speaking position, a discourse about threat, the protocols and guidelines that were used and, lastly, the maps that allowed a real-time monitoring of the influenza. The paper ends with the notion of panorama, as defined by Bruno Latour: a suggestion to describe the common denominator of the aforementioned operators, and a means to foresee the development of global scales for certain health alerts. The paper will conclude by proposing that this type of analysis would allow the One World One Health to understand with greater precision the dynamic of epidemics and thus make its principles of action much more specific as well as its definition of what global health should be.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tirado, Francisco; G\u00F3mez, Andr\u00E9s; Rocamora, Ver\u00F3nica","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54f41e920ee2d14bdd27c4811a41fd0eb22a1d5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25218795/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361400570X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027795361400570X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.09.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bruno Latour"],"organizations":["HIV/SIDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health","Influenza","certain health alerts","Health programme","previous health alerts","global condition","paper","development of global scales","status of global threat","new scales of action","global-scale phenomenon","action of certain socio-technical operators","aforementioned operators","concepts","World","principles of action","H1N1","new approaches","dynamic of epidemics","relevant elements","heterogeneous network of ideas","Actor-Network Theory","visibility","HIV","rapidity unparalleled","biological emergencies","mortality rate","propagation capacity","infectious diseases","severe cases","diffusion","speaking position","SIDA","order","recent decades","greater precision","suggestion","international response","discourse","common denominator","important ones","unprecedented speed","materials","onset","means","Bruno Latour","protocols","notion of panorama","real-time monitoring","SARS","definition","epidemiologic characteristics","maps","reason","Abstract","guidelines","article","type of analysis"],"language":"en"},

The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown but there are several evidences that associate the genetic basis of the disease with environmental causes. An important association between viral infection and development of MS is clearly demonstrated. Viruses have a strong impact on innate immune cells. In particular, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), are able to respond to viruses and to activate the adaptive immune response. Methods: In this study we mimic viral infection using synthetic single-strand RNA, Resiquimod, and we compared the response of both DC subsets derived from healthy donors and MS patients by characterizing the expression of costimulatory molecules on the DC surface. Results: We found that pDCs from MS patients express higher levels of OX40-L, HLA-DR, and CD86 than healthy donors. Moreover, we found that blood cells from MS patients and healthy donors upon Resiquimod-stimulation are enriched in a subpopulation of pDCs, characterized by a high amount of costimulatory molecules. Conclusion: Overall, these results indicate that activation of pDCs is enhanced in MS, likely due to a latent viral infection, and that costimulatory molecules expressed on pDCs could mediate a protective response against the viral trigger of autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corsetti, Marta; Ruocco, Gabriella; Ruggieri, Serena; Gasperini, Claudio; Battistini, Luca; Volpe, Elisabetta","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe21f4cd051907ab122c5583ca3d95ccaacba508.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6600519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20112811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS patients","development of MS","healthy donors","activation of pDCs","subpopulation of pDCs","latent viral infection","blood cells","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","myeloid dendritic cells","innate immune cells","expression of costimulatory molecules","viral trigger of autoimmunity","protective response","adaptive immune response","Viruses","Results","cause of multiple sclerosis","Resiquimod-stimulation","DC subsets","DC surface","chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease","mDCs","synthetic single-strand RNA","higher levels of OX40","central nervous system","strong impact","genetic basis","HLA-DR","CD86","study","important association","environmental causes","evidences","Background","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Among the non-SARS patients, 235 (93%) were diagnosed as having influenza infections (primarily H3N2 subtype) and 77 (30%) had radiological evidence of pneumonia. In the early phase of the illness and after adjusting for baseline characteristics, SARS patients were less likely to have lower respiratory symptoms (e.g. sputum production, shortness of breath, chest pain) and more likely to have myalgia (p \u003C 0.001). SARS patients had lower mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts (p \u003C 0.0001) and more commonly had \u201Cground-glass\u201D radiological changes with no pleural effusion. Despite having a younger average age, SARS patients had a more aggressive respiratory course requiring admission to the ICU and a higher mortality rate.

Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID(50) (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID(50) per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.

We previously reported that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferred cell-surface TMPRSS2 to endosomal cathepsin for cell entry, and that they acquired the ability to use cathepsin L by repeated passage in cultured cells and were then able to enter cells via the endosomal pathway. Here, we show that clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 preferred the cell-surface TMRRSS2 to endosomal cathepsins for cell entry, similar to HCoV-229E. In addition, the cell-culture-adapted HCoV-OC43 lost the ability to infect and replicate in air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells. These results suggest that circulating HCoVs in the field generally use cell-surface TMPRSS2 for cell entry, not endosomal cathepsins, in human airway epithelial cells.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shirato, Kazuya; Kawase, Miyuki; Matsuyama, Shutoku","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af3259ad6660d4dba31e93b1b924e0a12c82a388.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112029.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217303914; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217303914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217279/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell entry","cell-surface TMPRSS2","cell-culture","cell-surface TMRRSS2","endosomal cathepsins","endosomal pathway","cultured cells","human airway epithelial cells","clinical isolates of HCoV","adapted HCoV-OC43","HCoVs","ability","air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells","early endosome pathway","Abstract Human coronaviruses","extracellular proteases","transmembrane protease serine","spike protein","distinct pathways","HKU1","repeated passage","field","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

Despite their ubiquity, there is a lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic and economic research that has collected primary impact data, particularly associated with indirect costs, from families during ARIs in children. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month cohort study in 234 preschool children with impact diary recording and PCR testing of nose-throat swabs for viruses during an ARI. We used applied values to estimate a virus-specific mean cost of ARIs. RESULTS: Impact diaries were available for 72% (523/725) of community-managed illnesses between January 2003 and January 2004. The mean cost of ARIs was AU$309 (95% confidence interval $263 to $354). Influenza illnesses had a mean cost of $904, compared with RSV, $304, the next most expensive single-virus illness, although confidence intervals overlapped. Mean carer time away from usual activity per day was two hours for influenza ARIs and between 30 and 45 minutes for all other ARI categories. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, community-managed ARIs are a significant cost burden on families and society. The point estimate of the mean cost of community-managed influenza illnesses in healthy preschool aged children is three times greater than those illnesses caused by RSV and other respiratory viruses. Indirect costs, particularly carer time away from usual activity, are the key cost drivers for ARIs in children. The use of parent-collected specimens may enhance ARI surveillance and reduce any potential Hawthorne effect caused by compliance with study procedures. These findings reinforce the need for further integrated epidemiologic and economic research of ARIs in children to allow for comprehensive cost-effectiveness assessments of preventive and therapeutic options.","publish_time":"2008-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambert, Stephen B; Allen, Kelly M; Carter, Robert C; Nolan, Terence M","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15372a2da42ddcb56ac4edc88090a6a425c5fad0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2266731.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18215329/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-9-11","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza ARIs","community-managed ARIs","mean cost of community","virus-specific mean cost of ARIs","economic research of ARIs","managed influenza illnesses","community-managed illnesses","preschool children","significant cost burden","Mean carer time","Acute respiratory illnesses","respiratory viruses","families","key cost drivers","indirect costs","healthy preschool aged children","usual activity","impact diary","Impact diaries","ARI surveillance","ARI categories","society","RSV","primary impact data","significant morbidity","study procedures","confidence intervals","point estimate","lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic","month cohort study","expensive single-virus illness","PCR testing of nose","throat swabs","times greater","day","comprehensive cost-effectiveness assessments of preventive","potential Hawthorne effect","compliance","societal perspective","hours","AU","childhood","therapeutic options","specimens","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","need","minutes","use of parent","applied values","CONCLUSION","findings","ubiquity","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Between 1994 and 2010, seven people became infected with HeV, four fatally. All infected people were at a higher risk of exposure from contact with horses as they were either veterinary personnel, assisting veterinarians, or working in the horse industry. The management of emerging zoonoses is best approached from a One Health perspective as it benefits biosecurity as well as a public health, including the health of those most at risk, in this case private veterinarians. In 2011 we conducted a cross-sectional study of private veterinarians registered in Queensland and providing veterinary services to horses. The aim of this study was to gauge if participants had adopted recommendations for improved infection control, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the development of HeV specific management strategies during the winter of 2011. A majority of participants worked in practices that had a formal HeV management plan, mostly based on the perusal of official guidelines and an HeV field kit. The use of PPE increased as the health status of an equine patient decreased, demonstrating that many participants evaluated the risk of exposure to HeV appropriately; while others remained at risk of HeV infection by not using the appropriate PPE even when attending a sick horse. This study took place after Biosecurity Queensland had sent a comprehensive package about HeV management to all private veterinarians working in Queensland. However, those who had previous HeV experience through the management of suspected cases or had attended a HeV specific professional education programme in the previous 12 months were more likely to use PPE than those who had not. This may indicate that for private veterinarians in Queensland personal experience and face-to-face professional education sessions may be more effective in the improvement of HeV management than passive education via information packages. The role of different education pathways in the sustainable adoption of veterinary infection control measures should be further investigated.","publish_time":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendez, Diana; Buttner, Petra; Speare, Rick","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a399f129fbe5b2c9d09d0117e602d0d102e2e533.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175674/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.08.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587714002542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587714002542","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","Biosecurity Queensland"],"locations":["Queensland"],"keyphrases":["risk of HeV infection","improvement of HeV management","previous HeV experience","formal HeV management plan","development of HeV specific management strategies","HeV field kit","HeV specific professional education programme","case private veterinarians","cross-sectional study of private veterinarians","use of PPE","Biosecurity Queensland","Queensland personal experience","improved infection control","management of suspected cases","management of emerging zoonoses","passive education","additional infection control strategies","appropriate PPE","health status","public health","Health perspective","higher risk of exposure","sustainable adoption of veterinary infection control measures","face-to-face professional education sessions","veterinary services","veterinary personnel","horses","majority of participants","infected people","role of different education pathways","use of personal protective equipment","sick horse","horse industry","comprehensive package","months","emergence of Hendra virus","practices","perusal of official guidelines","information packages","contact","recommendations","winter","equine patient","Abstract","place","zoonosis","aim"],"language":"en"},

The recommendations and guidelines are evaluated in the light of disease caused by human pathogenic viruses. The guidelines outline a preventive management framework for safe drinking water. The framework includes health-based targets to assist national authorities who are normally responsible to set the targets for the protection of public health from risks by exposure to drinking water. Assessing the adequacy of systems, defining and monitoring control measures, and establishing management plans are the three components of the so-called water safety plans. Achievement of health-based targets may be verified by independent surveillance to assess the safety of the drinking water through additional verification or audit-based approaches. This framework for safe drinking water can be adapted according to environmental, social, economic, and cultural circumstances of drinking water provision on the national, regional, and local level. The chapter concludes that viruses could be considered as biocolloids with specific properties such as size, shape, structure, charge, composition, and genome. These viral characteristics determine their behavior in the environment, resistance to natural inactivation and treatment, and disinfection processes. For each (re-)emerging virus these properties may be known or could be assessed predicting the effectiveness of possible intervention measures for prevention of waterborne disease.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Roda Husman, Ana Maria; Bartram, Jamie","journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18a4656b2276bce90b52d441d1a442b1c8194f2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119133.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706907170075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287591/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706907170075; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17007-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safe drinking water","health-based targets","cultural circumstances of drinking water provision","so-called water safety plans","Achievement of health","guidelines","protection of public health","World Health Organization","management plans","preventive management framework","recommendations","chapter","audit-based approaches","national authorities","light of disease","specific properties","monitoring control measures","prevention of waterborne disease","human pathogenic viruses","effectiveness of possible intervention measures","additional verification","shape","size","components","natural inactivation","charge","environment","treatment","resistance","risks","behavior","composition","structure","biocolloids","exposure","disinfection processes","independent surveillance","adequacy of systems","emerging virus","local level","Publisher Summary","viral characteristics","genome","sanitation"],"language":"en"},

Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 \u00C5. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.","publish_time":"2016-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Han; Shi, Yi; Song, Jian; Qi, Jianxun; Lu, Guangwen; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ebddcd114c08628f8127529a8fa27209e1684f0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/238809c25f3649297a5b5344dd88867a5a52d293.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a188077530b3758029048129a53c8cdd870a60f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111281.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415017080; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867415017080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771495/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NPC1-C binding","NPC1 binding","domain C of NPC1","fusion-competent state","filovirus entry","membrane fusion","head of GPcl","internal fusion loop","necessary entry receptor","design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry","Ebola virus","primed GP","viral glycoprotein","molecular basis","late endosome","fatal hemorrhagic fever","Marburg","hydrophobic cavity","Niemann-Pick C1","protruding loops","prerequisite","conformational change","structural insights","endosomal protein","humans","primates","process","enzymatic cleavage","resolution","host cells","crystal structure","data","effective therapeutics","Filoviruses"],"language":"en"},

However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacy\u2014the beliefs in one\u0027s ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. METHODS: The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of N = 280 participants aged at least 18 years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6 months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. DISCUSSION: The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland.

Like the PLPs of other coronaviruses (CoVs), the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) PLP catalyzes proteolysis of Gly-Gly dipeptide bonds to release mature cleavage products. However, the other functions of the IBV PLP are not well understood. In this study, we found that IBV exhibits strong global DUB activity with significant reductions of the levels of ubiquitin (Ub)-, K48-, and K63-conjugated proteins. The DUB activity exhibited a clear time dependence, with stronger DUB activity in the early stage of viral infection. Furthermore, the IBV replicase-encoded PLP, including the downstream transmembrane (TM) domain, is a DUB enzyme and dramatically reduced the level of Ub-conjugated proteins, while processing both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. By contrast, PLP did not cause any reduction of haemagglutinin (HA)-Ub-conjugated proteins. In addition, mutations of the catalytic residues of PLP-TM, Cys1274Ser and His1437Lys, reduced DUB activity against Ub-, K48- and K63- conjugated proteins, indicating that the DUB activity of the PLP-TM wild-type protein is not completely dependent on its catalytic activity. Overall, these results demonstrate that the IBV-encoded PLP-TM functions as a DUB enzyme and suggest that IBV may interfere with the activation of host antiviral signaling pathway by degrading polyubiquitin-associated proteins.","publish_time":"2017-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Liping; Zhang, Xiaorong; Wu, Tianqi; Wang, Yuyang; Meng, Jie; Liu, Qian; Niu, Xiaosai; Wu, Yantao","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81f2232278cc96677f4095f6c4127ed382cdae87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087251.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3328-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316013/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLP","IBV PLP","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV PLP","reduced DUB activity","stronger DUB activity","DUB enzyme","IBV replicase-encoded PLP","IBV-encoded PLP-TM functions","Ub-conjugated proteins","strong global DUB activity","catalytic activity","K63-conjugated proteins","K63- conjugated proteins","catalytic residues of PLP","K48","PLP-TM wild-type protein","polyubiquitin-associated proteins","level of Ub","PLPs","proteases","K63-linked polyubiquitin chains","proteolysis of Gly","Gly dipeptide bonds","large replicase polyproteins","avian infectious bronchitis virus","significant reductions","Cys1274Ser","His1437Lys","clear time dependence","pathway","CoVs","levels of ubiquitin","domain","mature cleavage products","early stage of viral infection","processing","activation of host antiviral","mutations","coronaviruses","addition","Coronavirus papain","reduction of haemagglutinin","enzymes","results","study","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In order to evaluate the threat of viral infection faced by those working with animals, a cross-sectional, sero-epidemiological study was conducted in Guangdong between December 2013 and January 2014. Individuals working with swine, at poultry farms, or live poultry markets (LPM), and veterinarians, and controls not exposed to animals were enrolled in this study and 11 (4 human, 3 swine, 3 avian, and 1 canine) influenza A viruses were used in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (7 strains) and the cross-reactivity test (9 strains) in which 5 strains were used in both tests. Univariate analysis was performed to identify which variables were significantly associated with seropositivity. Odds ratios (OR) revealed that swine workers had a significantly higher risk of elevated antibodies against A/swine/Guangdong/L6/2009(H1N1), a classical swine virus, and A/swine/Guangdong/SS1/2012(H1N1), a Eurasian avian-like swine virus than non-exposed controls. Poultry farm workers were at a higher risk of infection with avian influenza H7N9 and H9N2. LPM workers were at a higher risk of infection with 3 subtypes of avian influenza, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. Interestingly, the OR also indicated that LPM workers were at risk of H1N1 swine influenza virus infection, perhaps due to the presence of pigs in the LPM. While partial confounding by cross-reactive antibodies against human viruses or vaccines cannot be ruled out, our data suggests that animal exposed people as are more likely to have antibodies against animal influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jidang; Ma, Jun; White, Sarah K.; Cao, Zhenpeng; Zhen, Yun; He, Shuyi; Zhu, Wanjun; Ke, Changwen; Zhang, Yongbiao; Su, Shuo; Zhang, Guihong","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fad9295d4be0528f8de7659224b5c3569f720724.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119354.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.09.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515300341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515300341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26476563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["swine workers","risk of H1N1 swine influenza virus infection","classical swine virus","LPM workers","higher risk of infection","avian influenza H7N9","subtypes of avian influenza","animal influenza viruses","Poultry farm workers","strains","higher risk of elevated antibodies","poultry farms","human viruses","cross-reactive antibodies","live poultry markets","threat of viral infection","Abstract Guangdong Province","animal exposed people","non-exposed controls","H9N2","animals","presence of pigs","sero-epidemiological study","dense populations of humans","H5N1","hemagglutination inhibition","partial confounding","assays","vaccines","cross-reactivity test","data","pets","veterinarians","canine","L6","SS1","variables","order","Individuals","Univariate analysis","Odds ratios","seropositivity","tests"],"language":"en"},

PIV was confirmed in 268 cases (4.37%), and linked to both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, being more frequent in children than in adults (5.23 and 2.43%, respectively). PIV1 and PIV3 were most common (31 and 32.5%, of total PIV positive samples, respectively), with distribution being similar in children and adults, as was viral load.

In the existing anomaly detection approaches, Markov chain techniques are widely accepted for their simple realization and few parameters. However, the short memory property of a classical Markov model ignores the interaction among data, and the long memory property of a higher order Markov model clouds the relationship between the previous data and current test data, and reduces the reliability of the model. Besides, both of these models cannot successfully describe the sequences changing with a tendency. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on a dynamic Markov model. This approach segments sequence data by a sliding window. In the sliding window, we define the states of data according to the value of the data and establish a higher order Markov model with a proper order consequently, to balance the length of the memory property and keep up with the trend of sequences. In addition, an anomaly substitution strategy is proposed to prevent the detected anomalies from impacting the building of the models and keep anomaly detection continuously. The experimental results using simulated datasets and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach improves the adaptability and stability of anomaly detection in sequence data.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Huorong; Ye, Zhixing; Li, Zhiwu","journal":"Information Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84a2642ec6d4891315d759e4422b0e8c800d2677.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094635.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226110/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020025517307302; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2017.05.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025517307302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stability of anomaly detection","Abstract Anomaly detection","previous data","states of data","intrusion detection","higher order Markov model","existing anomaly detection approaches","approach segments sequence data","classical Markov model","dynamic Markov model","current test data","anomaly substitution strategy","credit card fraud detection","proposed approach","Markov chain techniques","long memory property","short memory property","proper order","sliding window","models","real-world datasets","simulated datasets","trend of sequences","health care","medical field","relationship","wide variety of application domains","interaction","adaptability","experimental results","building","cyber security","addition","length","reliability","value","simple realization","detected anomalies","parameters","paper","tendency"],"language":"en"},

Other features of bat B cells were investigated. A significant increase in sIg(\u002B) B cell population was observed in the spleen and blood from LPS-injected bats but not from poly I:C-injected bats, supporting T-independent polyclonal B cell activation by LPS. Furthermore, using an in vitro calcium release assay, P. alecto B cells exhibited significant calcium release upon cross-linking of their B cell receptor. Together, this work contributes to improve our knowledge of bat adaptive immunity in particular B cells.","publish_time":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Periasamy, Pravin; Hutchinson, Paul E.; Chen, Jinmiao; Bonne, Isabelle; Shahul Hameed, Shahana Shereene; Selvam, Pavithra; Hey, Ying Ying; Fink, Katja; Irving, Aaron T.; Dutertre, Charles-Antoine; Baker, Michelle; Crameri, Gary; Wang, Lin-Fa; Alonso, Sylvie","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed919dda9ed5eb8ab60b40ad6eb04bf2d68cc63f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6428034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930908/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00489","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alecto B cells","particular B cells","percentages of B cells","features of bat B cells","alecto bats","B cell population","B cell receptor","NK cells","blood of bats","ability of bats","predominance of T cells","LPS-injected bats","T-independent polyclonal B cell activation","spleen","C-injected bats","spelaea colony bats","flow cytometry analysis of B","bat species","immune system","NK cell populations","knowledge of bat adaptive immunity","Pteropus alecto","significant calcium release","particular antibodies","different immune status","lack of bat specific reagents","calcium release assay","knowledge of bat\u0027s immunity","different fruit","significant increase","panel of cross-reactive antibodies","cross-linking","bone marrow","humans","functional characteristics","unique properties","inherent differences","CD27","CD21","MHC","NK1","reservoir","viruses","immunoglobulin","CD3","Results","work"],"language":"en"},

Selection for cattle with reduced susceptibility to respiratory disease would provide a permanent tool for reducing the prevalence of BRDC. The objective of this study was to identify BRDC susceptibility loci in pre-weaned Holstein calves as a prerequisite to using genetic improvement as a tool for decreasing the prevalence of BRDC. High density SNP genotyping with the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip was conducted on 1257 male and 757 female Holstein calves from California (CA), and 767 calves identified as female from New Mexico (NM). Of these, 1382 were classified as BRDC cases, and 1396 were classified as controls, with all phenotypes assigned using the McGuirk health scoring system. During the acquisition of blood for DNA isolation, two deep pharyngeal and one mid-nasal diagnostic swab were obtained from each calf for the identification of bacterial and viral pathogens. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted using four analytical approaches (EIGENSTRAT, EMMAX-GRM, GBLUP and FvR). The most strongly associated SNPs from each individual analysis were ranked and evaluated for concordance. The heritability of susceptibility to BRDC in pre-weaned Holstein calves was estimated. RESULTS: The four statistical approaches produced highly concordant results for 373 top ranked SNPs that defined 126 chromosomal regions for the CA population. Similarly, in NM, 370 SNPs defined 138 genomic regions that were identified by all four approaches. When the two populations were combined (i.e., CA \u002B NM) and analyzed, 324 SNPs defined 116 genomic regions that were associated with BRDC across all analytical methods. Heritability estimates for BRDC were 21% for both CA and NM as individual populations, but declined to 13% when the populations were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Four analytical approaches utilizing both single and multi-marker association methods revealed common genomic regions associated with BRDC susceptibility that can be further characterized and used for genomic selection. Moderate heritability estimates were observed for BRDC susceptibility in pre-weaned Holstein calves, thereby supporting the application of genomic selection to reduce the prevalence of BRDC in U.S. Holsteins.

Due to the restrictions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing. In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined. Methods We attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients. Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education. Results We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos. Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time. Conclusions These innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance. The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chick, Robert Connor; Clifton, Guy Travis; Peace, Kaitlin M.; Propper, Brandon W.; Hale, Diane F.; Alseidi, Adnan A.; Vreeland, Timothy J.","journal":"Journal of surgical education","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47122148621ae8df7bd1e3bf7614f11f0cb2be82.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253133/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931720420300842; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931720420300842","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surgical residents","rigorous surgical education","surgical resident education","innovative solutions","surgical residency programs","safety of residents","rigorous education","facilitated use of surgical videos","hands-on learning","person lectures","educational gap","educational landscape","person gatherings","time course","loss of learning exposure","support of national organizations","operative experience","flipped classroom model","online practice questions","procedural simulation","direct patient care","unique challenge","telemedicine clinics","place","Prevention","Disease Control","Centers","hospitals","elective operations","ways","substitute","rotations","pandemic","sites","problem","technology","unprecedented circumstance","changes","educators","scope","Conclusions","basic framework","restrictions","COVID","addition"],"language":"en"},

Aminopeptidases catalyze the process of removal of the N-terminal amino acids of target substrates by sequential cleavage of one amino acid residue at a time. Microbial aminopeptidase are of great acceptance as industrial enzymes with varying applications in food and pharma industry since these enzymes possess unique characteristics than aminopeptidases from other sources. This review describes the various applications of microbial aminopeptidases in different industrial sectors. These enzymes are widely used in food industry as a debittering agent as well as in the preparation of protein hydrolysates. In baking, brewing, and cheese making aminopeptidases are extensively used for removing the bitterness of peptides. The inhibitors of these enzymes are found great clinical applications against various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and viral infections. Aminopeptidases are widely used for the synthesis of biopeptides and amino acids, and found to be efficient than chemical synthesis. These enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing organophosphate compounds, thus having biological as well as environmental significance.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nandan, Arya; Nampoothiri, Kesavan Madhavan","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfc2c3c2e0d067d796b06e321252f2d26ff2e981.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186005.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10641-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["industrial enzymes","various applications of microbial aminopeptidases","amino acid residue","varying applications","great clinical applications","N-terminal amino acids of target substrates","food industry","great acceptance","sequential cleavage","various diseases","pharma industry","penultimate residue","synthesis of biopeptides","chemical synthesis","different industrial sectors","cleavage of peptide bond","preparation of protein hydrolysates","cancer","unique characteristics","diabetes","capable of hydrolyzing organophosphate compounds","process of removal","debittering agent","viral infections","sources","review","time","environmental significance","cheese","inhibitors","exoprotease family","bitterness of peptides","baking"],"language":"en"},

This pest forms a cryptic species complex that displays morphologically indistinguishable biotypes. Among them, the B and Q biotypes are the most important pests worldwide. Because they have different levels of insecticide resistance, these biotypes must be identified in order to achieve proper pest control. Therefore, a convenient, rapid and specific detection method for identifying the two biotypes is necessary. RESULTS: Loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was employed for rapid identification of B. tabaci B and Q biotypes. By combining a quick DNA extraction method, identification of the two biotypes was achieved within 1 h of detection time. The LAMP assay was applied to study the dynamics of B. tabaci biotypes both in the field and in greenhouses. It was found that, while temperature may be important for population dynamics of the whitefly in the field, population dynamics in greenhouse conditions may be influenced by the types of insecticide. CONCLUSION: The newly designed LAMP assay is a simple, rapid and accurate method for identifying the B and Q biotypes. It can be conducted by non\u2010specialists and can contribute to pest management.

An effective way to control IBDV would be to breed chickens with a reduced susceptibility to IBDV infection. In the present work, we used chickens selected for high and low specific responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (H and L, respectively) to assess the susceptibility of differential immune competent animals to IBDV infection. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high SRBC line (HL) and low SRBC line (LL) were infected with IBDV and viral RNA loads were determined at different time post-IBDV infection. Chicken orthologues of the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3) and interleukin-2 (IL-2); a Th2 cytokine, IL-10; a pro inflammatory cytokine, IL-6; the CCL chemokines, chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7; colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF; and a anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor \u03B2-2 (TGF\u03B2-2) were quantified. The expression of chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7 was significantly higher in L line as compared to H line. However, in H line the viral RNA loads were significantly lower than in L line. Therefore, the upregulated chemokines might be associated with the susceptibility to IBDV. The expression of IFN-\u03B3, IL-2 and IL-6 was significantly higher in H line as compared to L line. We assume that the higher proinflammatory cytokines expression in H line might be related to the rapid clearance of virus from PBMCs. Significantly higher levels of IL-10 and TGF\u03B2-2 mRNAs in L line might be related to the pathogenesis of IBDV. In conclusion, selection for antibody responses appears to influence the expression profiles of chemokines and cytokines against IBDV. Further, the selection for high SRBC response might improve the immuno-competence of chickens against IBDV.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Preeti; Singh, Rani; Saxena, V.

A variety of factors have been found to contribute to poor indoor-air quality in buildings, the primary one being indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air and the other major sources include outdoor pollutants . The chapter illustrates the factor affecting the indoor environmental quality which are inorganic contaminants, contaminants generated by combustion, organic contaminants, biological contaminants, and reducing exposure. People from different cultures have different comfort zones; even people belonging to the same family may feel comfortable under different conditions, and keeping everyone comfortable at the same time is an elusive goal at best. Thermal comfort involves temperature, humidity, and air movement. A comfort zone includes an optimal range and combinations of thermal factors, in which at least 80% of the building occupants feel satisfied. Ventilation is vital for the health and comfort of building occupants. It is needed to reduce and remove pollutants emitted from various internal and external sources. Good design combined with optimum air tightness is prerequisite to ensure healthy air quality, occupant comfort, and energy efficiency. There has been a lack of systematic experiments in which building materials are ranked according to their pollution strength and the impact on the indoor-air quality of using these materials in real rooms analyzed. These studies allow to quantify the extent to which using low-polluting building materials would reduce the energy needed for ventilation of buildings without compromising indoor-air quality.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubba, Sam","journal":"LEED Practices, Certification, and Accreditation Handbook","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781856176910000072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176910000072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poor indoor-air quality","healthy air quality","indoor environmental quality","air movement","indoor pollution sources","comfort of building occupants","Thermal comfort","optimum air tightness","occupant comfort","different comfort zones","inorganic contaminants","biological contaminants","low-polluting building materials","different cultures","different conditions","external sources","major sources","People","ventilation of buildings","chapter","combinations of thermal factors","energy efficiency","pollution strength","outdoor pollutants","variety of factors","combustion","optimal range","temperature","humidity","gases","impact","time","Good design","family","particles","Publisher Summary","elusive goal","best","extent","lack of systematic experiments","real rooms","exposure","studies"],"language":"en"},

As advancements in technology occur, more people these days are using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Due to the increase in social media\u0027s popularity, the types of behaviors are now easier to group and study as this is important to know the behavior of users via social networking in order to analyze similarities of certain behavior types and this can be used to predict what they post as well as what they comment, share, and like on social networking sites. However, very few review studies have undertaken grouping according to similarities and differences to predict the personality and behavior of individuals with the help of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to collect data from previous researches and to analyze the methods they have used. This chapter reviewed 30 research studies on the topic of behavioral analysis using the social media from 2015 to 2017. This research is based on the method of previous publications and analyzed the results, limitations, and number of users to draw conclusions. Our results indicated that the percentage of completed research on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram show that 50% of the studies were done on Twitter, 27% on Facebook, and 23% on Instagram. Twitter seems to be more popular and recent than the other two spheres as there are more studies on it. Further, we extracted the studies based on the year and graphs in 2015 which indicated that more research has been done on Facebook to analyze the behavior of users and the trends are decreasing in the following year. However, more studies have been done on Twitter in 2016 than any other social media. The results also show the classifications based on different methods to analyze individual behavior. However, most of the studies have been done on Twitter, as it is more popular and newer than Facebook and Instagram particularly from 2015 to 2017, and more research needs to be done on other social media spheres in order to analyze the trending behaviors of users. This study should be useful to obtain knowledge about the methods used to analyze user behavior with description, limitations, and results. Although some researchers collect demographic information on users\u2019 gender on Facebook, others on Twitter do not. This lack of demographic data, which is typically available in more traditional sources such as surveys, has created a new focus on developing methods to work out these traits as a means of expanding Big Data research.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Amandeep; Halgamuge, Malka N.; Moses, Beulah","journal":"Social Network Analytics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ec38198b8382246c22ad30fdab26ca53f32ef1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149696.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128154588000050; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128154588000050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Instagram","Big Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Twitter","Facebook","research studies","behavior of users","Instagram","social media spheres","results","review studies","Big Data research","help of social networking sites","behavior of individuals","user behavior","individual behavior","social media\u0027s popularity","similarities of certain behavior types","percentage of completed research","developing methods","different methods","number of users","trending behaviors of users","order","limitations","types of behaviors","lack of demographic data","study","certain behavioral outcomes","demographic information","Abstract Personality","previous researches","following year","topic of behavioral analysis","method of previous publications","major effects","character","users\u2019 gender","people","surveys","researchers","new focus","traits","means","days","trends","description","traditional sources","technology","increase","knowledge","classifications","differences","advancements","conclusions","graphs","share","chapter","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In a previously published study, we collected fecal pools from 2, 3, 5 and 8 week old turkey poults (80 pools from LTS farms and 40 from non-LTS farms) and examined them for the presence of astro-, rota-, reo-, and coronaviruses. To determine the presence of additional enteric viruses, we analyzed a fecal pool by Illumina sequencing and found picobirnavirus (PBV). Segments 1 and 2 of this virus shared 45.8% aa and 60.9\u201364.5% aa identity with genogroup I of human PBV, respectively.

The lack of such common standards combined with unfriendly interfaces make it difficult for biologists to learn how to use these tools and to translate the data formats from one to another. Consequently, the construction of an integrative bioinformatics platform to facilitate biologists\u2019 research is an urgent and challenging task. KDE Bioscience is a java-based software platform that collects a variety of bioinformatics tools and provides a workflow mechanism to integrate them. Nucleotide and protein sequences from local flat files, web sites, and relational databases can be entered, annotated, and aligned. Several home-made or 3rd-party viewers are built-in to provide visualization of annotations or alignments. KDE Bioscience can also be deployed in client-server mode where simultaneous execution of the same workflow is supported for multiple users. Moreover, workflows can be published as web pages that can be executed from a web browser. The power of KDE Bioscience comes from the integrated algorithms and data sources. With its generic workflow mechanism other novel calculations and simulations can be integrated to augment the current sequence analysis functions.

However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation remain poorly characterized. To dissect the function of HBc, a yeast two-hybrid was performed to identify HBc-binding proteins, and the C-terminal of BRG1/hBRM-associated factors 200 (BAF200C) was identified. Then, the existence of HBc interactions with BAF200C and full-length BAF200 was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293T, HepG2 and HepG2-NTCP cells. Furthermore, we show that the binding between HBc and BAF200 was of vital importance to HBc mediated downregulation of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) expression, and the mechanisms for the downregulation were disclosed as follows. Basal level of IFITM1 expression depends on BAF200, rather than the JAK\u2013STAT1 pathway. The interaction of HBc with BAF200 disturbs the stability of the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex and results in the suppression of IFTM1 transcription. Finally, the antiviral effects of IFITM1 on cell proliferation and HBV replication were found to be partially restored when HBc was co-transfected with BAF200. Collectively, our findings indicate that HBc plays a role in HBV resistance against the antiviral activities of IFN\u03B1, providing details about HBV evasion of host innate immunity.","publish_time":"2019-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Tongya; Ke, Zunlong; Liu, Weiyong; Xiong, Ying; Zhu, Ying; Liu, Yingle","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63c22b2cf82f4e4e9942d252fc33975a6db4d0d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6563218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075894/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11050427","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of HBc","interaction of HBc","HBc-binding proteins","existence of HBc interactions","HBc mediated downregulation of interferon","HBV resistance","HBV replication","full-length BAF200","HBV regulation of host","transmembrane protein","structural protein","HBV evasion of host innate immunity","antiviral effects of IFITM1","cell transcription","BAF200C","Human hepatitis B virus core protein","Basal level of IFITM1 expression","mechanisms of transcriptional regulation","cell proliferation","polybromo-associated BAF","antiviral activities of IFN\u03B1","hBRM-associated factors","co-immunoprecipitation assays","HepG2-NTCP cells","suppression of IFTM1 transcription","details","vital importance","results","C-terminal","BRG1","complex","PBAF","role","stability","JAK","yeast","hybrid","STAT1 pathway","findings"],"language":"en"},

Setcreasea purpurea lectin (designated as SPL) is a homotetrameric protein consisting of 12031.9 Da subunits linked by non-covalent bonds as determined by SDS-PAGE, gel filtration and MS. The N-terminal 25 amino-acid sequence of SPL, NVLGRDAYCGSQNPGATCPGLCCSK was determined and homology analysis suggested that SPL belongs to the family of chitin-binding plant lectins composed of hevein domains. The lectin exhibited strong hemagglutinating activity towards rabbit erythrocytes at 0.95 \u03BCg/ml and the activity could be reversed exclusively by chitin hydrolysate (oligomers of GlcNAc). Its hemagglutinating activity was stable in pH range of 2.0\u20139.0 and it showed excellent thermal tolerance. SPL showed antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Penicillium italicum and Helminthosporiun maydis. It also exhibited inhibitory effect on HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (ROD), with an EC(50) of 13.8 \u00B1 1.3 and 57.1 \u00B1 15 \u03BCg/ml, respectively. Subsequently, MTT method, cell morphological analysis and LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that SPL was highly cytotoxic to CNE-1 cells and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, due to the caspase inhibitors analyses, caspase was also found to play an important role in the potential apoptotic mechanism of SPL.","publish_time":"2010-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Qing; Wu, Chuan-fang; Luo, Ping; Xiang, Xiao-cong; Liu, Jun-jie; Mou, Lin; Bao, Jin-ku","journal":"Process Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3c22006fb9e368de72eaaf01f469f2415c1ca77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185743.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511310002072; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359511310002072; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Setcreasea","SPL","EC","LDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antifungal activity","strong hemagglutinating activity","chitin-binding lectin","family of chitin","Setcreasea purpurea lectin","amino-acid sequence of SPL","potential apoptotic mechanism of SPL","chitin hydrolysate","HIV","\u03BCg","LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays","induced apoptosis","homology analysis","rhizomes of Setcreasea purpurea Boom","cell morphological analysis","binding plant lectins","member of family Commelinaceae","caspase inhibitors analyses","Sclerotinia sclerotiorum","Rhizoctonia solani","Penicillium italicum","rabbit erythrocytes","subunits","SDS-PAGE","N-terminal","cells","CNE","NVLGRDAYCGSQNPGATCPGLCCSK","gel filtration","MTT method","non-covalent bonds","important role","Helminthosporiun","dose-dependent manner","hevein domains","pH range","activities","oligomers of GlcNAc","IIIB","homotetrameric protein","kDa","inhibitory effect","excellent thermal tolerance","ROD"],"language":"en"},

These outbreaks normally result in overstretching of health facilities as well as death in children under the age of five. Most of these infections are usually self-limiting except for the neurological complications associated with human enterovirus A 71 (EV-A71). The infection dynamics of these viruses have not been fully understood, with most inferences made from previous studies conducted with poliovirus. Non-poliovirus enteroviral infections are responsible for major outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) often associated with neurological complications and severe respiratory diseases. The myriad of disease presentations observed so far in children calls for an urgent need to fully elucidate the replication processes of these viruses. There are concerted efforts from different research groups to fully map out the role of human host factors in the replication cycle of these viral infections. Understanding the interaction between viral proteins and human host factors will unravel important insights on the lifecycle of this groups of viruses. This review provides the latest update on the interplay between human host factors/processes and non-polio enteroviruses (NPEV). We focus on the interactions involved in viral attachment, entry, internalization, uncoating, replication, virion assembly and eventual egress of the NPEV from the infected cells. We emphasize on the virus- human host interplay and highlight existing knowledge gaps that needs further studies. Understanding the NPEV-human host factors interactions will be key in the design and development of vaccines as well as antivirals against enteroviral infections. Dissecting the role of human host factors during NPEV infection cycle will provide a clear picture of how NPEVs usurp the human cellular processes to establish an efficient infection. This will be a boost to the drug and vaccine development against enteroviruses which will be key in control and eventual elimination of the viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Owino, Collins Oduor; Chu, Justin Jang Hann","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57ae4e660730c4f3591f27a4058164362d6f5cb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6582496.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-019-0540-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia Pacific","Europe","United States of America"],"keyphrases":["role of human host factors","NPEV-human host factors interactions","human enterovirus","virus- human host interplay","human cellular processes","Non-poliovirus enteroviral infections","replication processes","NPEV infection cycle","Non-polio enteroviruses","outbreaks of polio","groups of viruses","replication cycle","viral attachment","viral proteins","emerging viruses","key","neurological complications","efficient infection","children","infection dynamics","major outbreaks of hand","different research groups","eventual egress","eventual elimination","development of vaccines","vaccine development","different parts","mouth disease","previous studies","myriad of disease presentations","uncoating","foot","internalization","virion assembly","entry","existing knowledge gaps","important insights","Europe","HFMD","NPEVs","clear picture","control","Asia Pacific","latest update","United States of America","cases","death","concerted efforts","severe respiratory diseases","drug","lifecycle","design","world","antivirals","overstretching of health facilities","urgent need","boost","EV-A71","infected cells","review","inferences","age"],"language":"en"},

Mean wind flow around each building model and wind-induced flow inside re-entrant bays are computed. To determine the ventilation efficiency of the bay, the computed flow field is used to disperse a scalar pollutant initially occupying the entire bay at a uniform concentration. The subsequent time decay of pollutant concentration inside the bay is studied and the ventilation efficiency is quantified by the retention time. The results show that wind-induced flow inside the bay, especially on the building side face, is complex and highly three-dimensional. Air exchange rates through the roof opening and vertical side opening are analyzed for each bay and their relationship to the ventilation efficiency is discussed. The bays on the building side faces are much worse ventilated than those on the windward or leeward building face. The deeper the side bay, the worse is the air exchange and ventilation. The building height is found to have a governing effect on the ventilation of the windward and leeward re-entrant bays.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, C.K.C.; Lam, K.

In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its role may be of further importance because it is performed bedside and may limit chest X-ray and the need for transport to radiology for computed tomography (CT) scan. Since February 21, we progressively turned into a coronavirus-dedicated intensive care unit and applied an ultrasound-based approach to avoid traditional imaging and limit contamination as much as possible. We performed a complete daily examination with lung ultrasound score computation and systematic search of complications (pneumothorax, ventilator-associated pneumonia); on-duty physicians were free to perform CT or chest X-ray when deemed indicated. We compared conventional imaging exams performed in the first 4 wk of the COVID-19 epidemic with those in the same time frame in 2019: there were 84 patients in 2020 and 112 in 2019; 64 and 22 (76.2% vs. 19.6%, p \u003C 0.001) had acute respiratory failure, respectively, of which 55 (85.9%) were COVID-19 in 2020.

The outcomes of outbreak simulations on networks are driven both by the underlying epidemic model, and by the networks\u2019 structural properties, so that the same pathogen can generate different epidemic dynamics on different networks. Here we ask whether there are general properties that make a contact network intrinsically vulnerable to epidemics (that is, regardless of specific epidemiological parameters). By conducting simulations on a large set of modelled networks, we show that, when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account, the effect of specific network properties on outbreak magnitude is stronger than that of fundamental pathogen features such as transmission rate, infection duration, and immunization ability. Then, by focusing on a large set of real world networks of the same type (potential contacts between field voles, Microtus agrestis), we showed how network structure can be used to accurately assess the relative, intrinsic vulnerability of networks towards a specific pathogen, even when those have limited topological variability. These results have profound implications for how we prevent disease outbreaks; in many real world situations, the topology of host contact networks can be described and used to infer intrinsic vulnerability. Such an approach can increase preparedness and inform preventive measures against emerging diseases for which limited epidemiological information is available, enabling the identification of priority targets before an epidemic event.","publish_time":"2018-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strona, G.; Carstens, C.J.; Beck, P.S.A.; Han, B.A.","journal":"Ecol Modell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/560c831e215a39066388a9b94b7a576407d2d3f6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a396657b0c580d496e109b82967c1a89d191ee9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6039859.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30210182/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030438001830173X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.05.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438001830173X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different networks","intrinsic vulnerability of networks","large set of real world networks","topology of host contact networks","large set of modelled networks","specific pathogen","effect of specific network properties","network structure","different epidemic dynamics","epidemics","epidemic event","general properties","specific epidemiological parameters","broad range of network topologies","real world situations","fundamental pathogen features","underlying epidemic model","networks\u2019 structural properties","outcomes of outbreak simulations","potential contacts","potential hosts","infection duration","outbreak magnitude","infection pathways","epidemiological information","type","transmission rate","field voles","links","emerging diseases","Microtus agrestis","disease outbreaks","nodes","account","identification of priority targets","preventive measures","convenient models","preparedness","profound implications","immunization ability","results","approach","topological variability"],"language":"en"},

This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, our data unveils a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.","publish_time":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robitaille, Alexa C.; Caron, Elise; Zucchini, Nicolas; Mukawera, Esp\u00E9rance; Adam, Damien; Mariani, M\u00E9lissa K.; G\u00E9linas, Ana\u00EFs; Fortin, Audray; Brochiero, Emmanuelle; Grandvaux, Nathalie","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5deb9073195a49301f2eb72bc7d327ea2e9393e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5727028.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234123/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17689-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DUSP1 inhibition","virus-induced JNK","pathogenic virus","Sendai virus","model virus","virus pathogenesis","antiviral defense","unrecognized selective role of DUSP1","host defense","host antiviral response","SeV-induced apoptosis","human respiratory syncytial virus","scaffold protein","important role of protein phosphatases","dephosphorylation of JNK","RSV-infected cells","anti-RSV vaccine","regulation of tissue damage","cell migration","activation of cell death pathways","p38 MAPK phosphorylation","repair","induction of interferons","Pneumoviridae family","downstream cytokine production","vector","infections","proinflammatory cytokines","dual-specificity phosphatase","key regulators","Post-translational modifications","data","viral replication","Interaction","proteasomal degradation"],"language":"en"},

We present the global characteristics of the RNA genome of Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging pathogen within the Flavivirus genus. ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 in Uganda, caused a widespread epidemic in South and Central America and the Caribbean in 2015 and has recently been associated with microcephaly in newborns. METHODS: The nearly 11 kb positive-stranded RNA genome of ZIKV was analyzed for its nucleotide composition, also in the context of the folded RNA molecule. Nucleotide trends were investigated along the genome length by skew analyses and we analyzed the codons used for translation of the ZIKV proteins. RESULTS: ZIKV RNA has a biased nucleotide composition in being purine-rich and pyrimidine-poor. This preference for purines is a general characteristic of the mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses. The virus-specific nucleotide bias is further enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded regions of the structured ZIKV RNA genome, thus further imposing this ZIKV-specific signature. The codons used for translation of the ZIKV proteins is also unusual, but we show that it is the underlying bias in nucleotide composition of the viral RNA that largely dictates these codon preferences. CONCLUSIONS: The ZIKV RNA genome has a biased nucleotide composition that dictates the codon usage of this flavivirus. We discuss the evolutionary scenarios and molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for these distinctive ZIKV RNA genome features.","publish_time":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Hemert, Formijn; Berkhout, Ben","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4ced0e08f5b03e84a5addaaf3557b3cdc1ef277.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4898363.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0551-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27278486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","ZIKV"],"locations":["South","Central America","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["structured ZIKV RNA genome","ZIKV proteins","positive-stranded RNA genome of ZIKV","distinctive ZIKV RNA genome features","RNA viruses","viral RNA","biased nucleotide composition","RNA genome of Zika virus","distinct nucleotide composition","ZIKV-specific signature","Nucleotide trends","folded RNA molecule","genome length","virus-specific nucleotide bias","codon usage","codon preferences","codons","translation","underlying bias","Flavivirus genus","single-stranded regions","genomes","purine-rich","widespread epidemic","South","Central America","context","emerging pathogen","mosquito","general characteristic","molecular mechanisms","skew analyses","global characteristics","purines","evolutionary scenarios","Uganda","Caribbean","pyrimidine-poor","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","tick-borne flaviviruses","microcephaly","newborns","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Sequencing analysis of the S (S1 portion), HE, ORF4 and ORF5 genes of BCoV isolates associated with different clinical syndromes indicated that neither insertions or deletions could explain their distinct tropism. For the HE glycoprotein, a total of 15 amino acids (aa) substitutions were identified by comparing field isolates to the prototype Mebus strain. Two specific proline substitutions were identified for virulent strains being located in the signal peptides (aa 5) and aa position 367; one specific aa change was revealed at position 66 for RBCoV field isolates. Analysis of the S1 portion of the S glycoprotein revealed a total of eight aa changes specific to enteropathogenic (EBCoV) strains and eight aa changes specific to RBCoV strains. For all BCoV isolates studied, the region located between the S and M genes (ORF4) apparently encodes for two non-structural (ns) proteins of 4.9 and 4.8 kDa. A specific non-sense mutation was identified for the nucleotide at position 88 of the putative 4.9 kDa protein gene of RBCoV isolates resulting in 29 rather that 43 aa residues. The ORF5, which encodes a 12.7 ns protein and the 9.5 kDa E protein, was highly conserved amongst the BCoV field isolates.","publish_time":"2001-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00E9linas, Anne-Marie; Boutin, Martine; Sasseville, A.Marie-Jos\u00E9e; Dea, Serge","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a52404c7cdc68445f80cb3ddde5781d4ec5cbe5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127236.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817020100243X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817020100243X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ontario"],"keyphrases":["RBCoV field isolates","NCDBCoV strains","WDBCoV strains","aa position","aa changes specific","reference strains","virulent strains","specific aa change","kDa protein gene of RBCoV isolates","aa residues","ORF5 genes of BCoV isolates","respiratory bovine coronaviruses RBCoV strains","Abstract Bovine coronavirus isolates","S glycoprotein","specific proline substitutions","ns protein","kDa E protein","ORF4","total","S1 portion","specific non-sense mutation","MAbs","WDBCoV strain BCQ","Sequencing analysis","prototype Mebus strain","recent outbreaks of respiratory disease","Ontario","higher RDE activities","serogroups","EBCoV","rat erythrocytes","Quebec dairy farms","winter dysentery","different clinical syndromes","neonatal calf diarrhea","insertions","hemagglutinating properties","enteropathogenic","amino acids","deletions","nucleotide","hemagglutination inhibition","signal peptides","adult cattle","proteins","region","distinct tropism","respect"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A government hospital serving low-income and middle-income population in Amman, Jordan. PARTICIPANTS: Children under 2 years of age hospitalised with fever and/or respiratory symptoms (n=3168) from 16 March 2010 to 31 March 2013. Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisation rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS) and death. RESULTS: Of the 3168 subjects, 2581 (82%) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most predominant pathogen isolated. During admission, 1013 (32%) received oxygen therapy, 284 (9%) were admitted to ICU, 111 (4%) were placed on MV and 31 (1%) children died. Oxygen therapy was higher in RSV-only subjects compared with human rhinovirus-only (42%vs29%, p\u003C0.001), adenovirus-only (42%vs21%, p\u003C0.001) and human parainfluenza virus-only (42%vs23%, p\u003C0.001) subjects. The presence of an underlying medical condition was associated with oxygen therapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.95, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.56), ICU admission (aOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.68), MV (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.28) and longer LOS (aOR1.71, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.13). Similarly, younger age was associated with oxygen therapy (0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), ICU admission (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), MV (0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53) and longer LOS (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59). Pneumonia was strongly associated with longer LOS (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.60), oxygen therapy (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.22 to 3.89), ICU admission (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.50) and MV (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.85 to 6.00). Virus-specific hospitalisation rates ranged from 0.5 to 10.5 per 1000 children. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses are associated with severe illness in Jordanian children hospitalised with ARI. Prevention strategies such as extended breast feeding, increased access to palivizumab and RSV vaccine development could help decrease hospitalisation rates and illness severity, particularly in young children with underlying medical conditions.","publish_time":"2018-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Lawrence, Lindsey; Piya, Bhinnata; Wang, Li; Fonnesbeck, Christopher; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Vermund, Sten H; Williams, John V; Halasa, Natasha B","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57b3f365b56a5db10967e1e3f16ade5a85eb296d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e2173589087169565c3aab50650c965bd545124d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5961648.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":["ICU","MV","ARI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oxygen therapy","ICU admission","MV","young children","Jordanian children","virus-specific hospitalisation rates","respiratory syncytial virus","longer LOS","Respiratory viruses","respiratory symptoms","subjects","markers of illness severity","human parainfluenza virus","severe illness","acute respiratory infections","chemotherapy-associated neutropenia","ARI","RSV vaccine development","underlying medical conditions","years of age","human rhinovirus","younger age","Prospective cohort study","risk factors","seasonal trends","increased access","intensive care unit","middle-income population","palivizumab","mechanical ventilation","extended breast","government hospital","length of stay","Amman","fever","OUTCOME MEASURES","Prevention strategies","SETTING","DESIGN","presence","newborns","aOR1","predominant pathogen isolated","adenovirus","vs21","vs29","death","CONCLUSION","PARTICIPANTS","OBJECTIVE","Pneumonia","vs23","birth","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods Manuscripts were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, including pathophysiology and pregnancy. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Reproductive outcomes; effects on gametes; pregnancy outcomes; neonatal complications. Results Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported.

Since primary RVFV strains must be handled in BSL-3\u002B or BSL-4 facilities, a RVFV cell\u2013cell fusion assay will facilitate the investigation of RVFV glycoprotein function under BSL-2 conditions. As for other members of the Bunyaviridae family, RVFV glycoproteins are targeted to the Golgi, where the virus buds, and are not efficiently delivered to the cell surface. However, overexpression of RVFV glycoproteins using an alphavirus replicon vector resulted in the expression of the glycoproteins on the surface of multiple cell types. Brief treatment of RVFV glycoprotein expressing cells with mildly acidic media (pH 6.2 and below) resulted in rapid and efficient syncytia formation, which we quantified by \u03B2-galactosidase \u03B1-complementation. Fusion was observed with several cell types, suggesting that the receptor(s) for RVFV is widely expressed or that this acid-dependent virus does not require a specific receptor to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion. Fusion occurred over a broad temperature range, as expected for a virus with both mosquito and mammalian hosts. In contrast to cell fusion mediated by the VSV-G glycoprotein, RVFV glycoprotein-dependent cell fusion could be prevented by treating target cells with trypsin, indicating that one or more proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the host cell surface are needed to support membrane fusion. The cell\u2013cell fusion assay reported here will make it possible to study the membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins in a high-throughput format and to screen small molecule inhibitors for the ability to block virus-specific membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2006-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Filone, Claire Marie; Heise, Mark; Doms, Robert W.; Bertolotti-Ciarlet, Andrea","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2d27310b7add3827d3765104f57928f4e097a2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134558.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206005125; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206005125","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVFV cell","cell fusion assay","RVFV glycoprotein-dependent cell fusion","membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins","host cell surface","overexpression of RVFV glycoproteins","virus-specific membrane fusion","surface of multiple cell types","investigation of RVFV glycoprotein function","Brief treatment of RVFV glycoprotein","primary RVFV strains","virus buds","BSL","acid-dependent virus","VSV-G glycoprotein","specific receptor","Bunyaviridae family","Abstract Rift Valley fever virus","target cells","ability","high-throughput format","alphavirus replicon vector","small molecule inhibitors","protein-associated carbohydrate","domestic animals","acidic media","cattle","humans","mosquitoes","Phlebovirus genus","Golgi","facilities","efficient syncytia formation","\u03B2-galactosidase \u03B1-complementation","broad temperature range","sheep","mammalian hosts","conditions","members","trypsin","contrast"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to substitute the heptadic residues at 257, 264, 271, 278, 285, 292, and 299 in this motif with alanine. Additionally, 3 middle heptadic leucine residues at 271, 278, and 285 were replaced with alanine singly or in combination. A vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase transient expression system was employed to express the wild-type or mutated fusion (F) proteins. Three different types of membrane fusion assays were performed to analyze the fusogenic activity, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was executed to examine the cell surface expression level, and a coimmunoprecipitation assay was conducted to probe the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN)-F interaction at the cell surface. RESULTS: All of the substitutions in this motif exhibited diminished or even lost fusion activity in all stages of fusion, although they all had no effect on cell surface expression. In the coimmunoprecipitation assay, all mutants resulted in decreased detection of the HN-F complexes compared with that of the wild-type F protein.

One of the concerns is that there may be multiple transmission routes across households in high-rise residential buildings, one of which is the natural ventilative airflow through open windows between flats, caused by buoyancy effects. Our early on-site measurement using tracer gases confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively that the re-entry of the exhaust-polluted air from the window of the lower floor into the adjacent upper floor is a fact. This study presents the modeling of this cascade effect using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. It is found that the presence of the pollutants generated in the lower floor is generally lower in the immediate upper floor by two orders of magnitude, but the risk of infection calculated by the Wells\u2013Riley equation is only around one order of magnitude lower. It is found that, with single-side open-window conditions, wind blowing perpendicularly to the building may either reinforce or suppress the upward transport, depending on the wind speed. High-speed winds can restrain the convective transfer of heat and mass between flats, functioning like an air curtain. Despite the complexities of the air flow involved, it is clear that this transmission route should be taken into account in infection control.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, N.

The severe and sudden onset of symptoms, resulting in an atypical pneumonia with dry cough and persistent high fever in cases of severe acute respiratory virus brought to light the importance of coronaviruses as potentially lethal human pathogens and the identification of several zoonotic reservoirs has made the reemergence of new strains and future epidemics all the more possible. In this chapter, we describe the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting airway to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in relevant in vitro systems. The first culture model is a human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu3 that can be inoculated by viruses either as a non-polarized monolayer of cells or polarized cells with tight junctions and microvilli. The second model system, derived from primary cells isolated from human airway epithelium and grown on Transwells, form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo. Experimental results using these lung epithelial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases SARS-CoV replicates to high titers in epithelial cells of the conducting airway. The SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polarized Calu3 cells and human airway epithelial cultures (HAE), indicating that hACE2 was accessible by SARS-CoV after airway lumenal delivery. Furthermore, in HAE, hACE2 was exclusively localized to ciliated airway epithelial cells. In support of the hACE2 localization data, the most productive route of inoculation and progeny virion egress in both polarized Calu3 and ciliated cells of HAE was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lumen of the human lung. Preincubation of the apical surface of cultures with antisera directed against hACE2 reduced viral titers by 2 logs while antisera against DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR did not reduce viral replication levels suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for entry of SARS-CoV into the ciliated cells of HAE cultures. To assess infectivity in ciliated airway cultures derived from susceptible animal species we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF 7a/b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulting in SARS-CoV GFP.

However, disasters like COVID-19 disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with mental health conditions may be among the hardest hit.

Towards a better understanding of the bat immune system, we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable (VH) regions of antibodies from the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto. The germline repertoire of the closely related Pteropid bat, Pteropus vampyrus, whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes. Representative VH genes were found in all three mammalian VH clans (I, II and III) in both the expressed P. alecto VH repertoire and the germline P. vampyrus VH repertoire. Evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments for the generation of diverse VDJ rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of P. alecto.

In this study, we described, according to seasons, ages and clinical units, the results obtained in children (\u003C15 years old) by multiplex-PCR (mPCR) tests allowing a quick and wide range detection of all respiratory viruses. These results were also compared with RSV specific detection. METHODS: All nasopharyngeal mPCR and RSV tests requested by clinicians in our French teaching hospitals group between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively included. All repeated samples for the same children in the same month were discarded. RESULTS: Of the 381 mPCR tests (344 children) performed, 51.4% were positive. Positivity and viral co-infection rates were higher in the 6\u201336 months old strata (81% and 25%, p\u003C0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). Viral distribution showed strong variations across ages. During specific influenza epidemic periods, only 1/39 (2.5%) mPCR tests were positive for influenza and 19/39 (48.7%) for other viruses. During specific RSV epidemic periods, only 8/46 (17.4%) mPCR tests were positive for RSV and 14/46 (30.4%) for other viruses. 477/1529 (31.2%) of RSV immunochromatography-tests were positive. Among the negatives immunochromatography-test also explored by mPCR, 28/62 (31%) were positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: This study provides a wide description of respiratory viruses\u2019 distribution among children in hospital settings using mPCR over 3 years. It emphasizes the number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses according to the current diagnosis practice in France and gives a better picture of respiratory viruses identified in hospital settings by mPCR all over the year in France.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Visseaux, Benoit; Collin, Gilles; Ichou, Houria; Charpentier, Charlotte; Bendhafer, Samia; Dumitrescu, Madalina; Allal, Lahcene; Cojocaru, Bogdan; Desfr\u00E8re, Luc; Descamps, Diane; Mandelbrot, Laurent; Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9467bbfc6a67f8a76ac8242a14207676d03c041.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5325537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28235002/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172809","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["mPCR tests","RSV tests","RSV immunochromatography-tests","nasopharyngeal mPCR","children","RSV specific detection","respiratory viruses\u2019 detection","better picture of respiratory viruses","RSV testing","number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses","specific RSV epidemic periods","results","wide description of respiratory viruses\u2019 distribution","specific influenza epidemic periods","hospital settings","Viral distribution","wide range detection","ages","France","years old","study","clinical units","paediatric units","months old strata","negatives immunochromatography-test","viral co-infection rates","clinicians","current diagnosis practice","multiplex-PCR","French teaching hospitals group","Positivity","strong variations","date","seasons","METHODS","BACKGROUND","repeated samples","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In this Editorial the different aspects of changes in our routine are described, based on the experience of this Editor in Germany. I will try to give you a bit of background information first, as the situation is very much dependent on the specific phase of the pandemic and your place of work. The experience for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in New York or Madrid may differ from that of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in Singapore, or South Korea. As Europe is, at least at the moment, the most affected continent, it hopefully is an interesting topic for all of you. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is divided into 4 sessions: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family member. Most countries have stopped elective surgeries and by that relegated Orthopaedic surgeons to a minimum of work. Keeping contact to patients with digital tools might be an option to achieve an organised restart after the end of the lock down period and to keep treating patients through that phase. For many Orthopaedic surgeons, the principal task now is being part of an interdisciplinary team that is headed by colleagues from Internal Medicine or Anaesthesiology. Wards from the Orthopaedic department are reorganised as quarantine wards for Covid-19 patients. Worldwide all conferences have been cancelled and nobody knows for how long this will continue. Education now has become fully digital, allowing to present and communicate without real limitations compared to conventional conferences. Some teaching options, such as hands-on workshops, fellowships, etc. are ceased and cannot be replaced by digital options. Due to social distancing families are spending much more time together than before, while some family members, especially the people at risk (elders, ones with a fragile health) cannot be visited for a long time. Get togethers with friends as well as community meetings are completely suspended. For some of them, digital technology is the only option to minimize the problem of social distancing. Overall, it has to be stated, that all parts of our lives as an Orthopaedic Surgeon are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As nobody knows how long these restrictions need to remain in place we have to accept them and work on improving this specific situation by following the rules. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed in the near future, allowing us to return to a \u201Cnormal\u201D life.

The epidemics spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two regions: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing and its surrounding areas. The resulting case fatality ratio of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries and regions, partly due to younger-aged patients and a higher proportion of community-acquired infections. Strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response were most important for controlling SARS. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited. Many recovered patients suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of corticosteroid usage during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable experience and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. Additionally, the epidemic has substantially improved infrastructures, surveillance systems, and capacity to response to health emergencies. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Wuchun; Fang, Liqun; Xiao, Dan","journal":"Global Health Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64ac9ea208cb5fbcc6ff1c4b1624d301b492bcaf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2414644719300545; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2414644719300545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","epidemics","regions","Chinese health system","coordinated response","recovered patients","health emergencies","younger-aged patients","consequence of corticosteroid usage","long-term economic consequence","comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system","lessons relevant","severe acute respiratory syndrome","capacity","valuable experience","overview","higher proportion of community","outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","large geographical extent","surveillance systems","avascular osteonecrosis","fundamental reforms","months","infrastructures","Strong political commitment","mainland China","Beijing","resulting case fatality ratio","infections","Guangdong Province","surrounding areas","article","countries","half"],"language":"en"},

Legionnaire\u0027s disease can be differentiated from typical CAPs and from other atypical CAPs based on its characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. The first clinically useful diagnostic weighted point score system for the clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease was developed by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s. It has proven to be diagnostically accurate and useful for more than two decades, but was time-consuming. Because Legionella spp. diagnostic tests are time-dependent and problematic, a need was perceived for a rapid, simple way to render a clinical, syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease pending Legionella test results. During the \u201Cherald wave\u201D of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in the New York area, our hospital, like others, was inundated with patients who presented to the Emergency Department with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for H1N1 testing/evaluation. Most patients with ILIs did not have swine influenza. Hospitalized patients with ILIs who tested positive with rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) were placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of adult patients admitted with an ILI had negative RIDTs. Because the definitive laboratory diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), testing was restricted by health departments, resulted in clinical and infection control dilemmas in determining which RIDT-negative patients did, in fact, have H1N1 pneumonia. Objective Accordingly, a diagnostic weighted point score system was developed for H1N1 pneumonia patients, based on RT-PCR positivity by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital. This diagnostic point score system for hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs was time-consuming. As the pandemic progressed, a simplified diagnostic swine influenza (H1N1) triad was developed for the rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia, which also differentiated it from its mimics as well as from bacterial pneumonia, eg, Legionnaires\u0027 disease. During the \u201Cherald wave\u201D of the H1N1 pandemic, we noticed an unexplained increase in Legionnaires\u0027 disease CAPs. Because clinical resources were stressed to the maximum during the pandemic, it was critically important to rapidly identify patients rapidly with Legionnaire\u0027s disease who did not require influenza precautions or oseltamivir, but who did require anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy. Methods Based on the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic weighted point score system for Legionnaires\u0027 disease (modified), key indicators were identified and became the basis for the diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad. The diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad was used to make a clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease until the results of Legionella diagnostic tests were reported. The diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad diagnosed Legionnaires\u0027 disease in hospitalized adults with CAPs with extrapulmonary findings (atypical CAP) and relative bradycardia, accompanied by any three (ie, a triad) of the following: otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, early/mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), highly increased ferritin levels (\u22652 \u00D7 n), or hypophosphatemia. The diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad provides clinicians with a rapid way to clinically diagnose Legionnaires\u0027 disease, pending Legionella test results. Results The accuracy of the diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad was confirmed in our 9 cases of Legionnaires\u0027 disease by subsequent Legionella diagnostic testing. Conclusions The diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad is particularly useful in situations where a rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis is needed, ie, during an H1N1 pandemic.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.; Mickail, Nardeen; Syed, Uzma; Strollo, Stephanie; Laguerre, Marianne","journal":"Heart \u0026 Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61dddfc6419753c9063d6cce6b9031fbb6e1222b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112664.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20457348/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S014795630900260X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.10.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014795630900260X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infectious Disease Division"],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["diagnostic Legionnaires\u0027 disease triad","Legionnaires\u0027 disease CAPs","cases of Legionnaires\u0027 disease","clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease","Legionnaire\u0027s disease","syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease","rapid influenza diagnostic tests","H1N1 pneumonia patients","results of Legionella diagnostic tests","H1N1 pandemic","diagnostic point score system","simplified diagnostic swine influenza","subsequent Legionella diagnostic testing","H1N1 testing","Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic weighted point score system","rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia","useful diagnostic weighted point score system","Hospitalized patients","rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis","definitive laboratory diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia","influenza precautions","clinical resources","Legionella test results","adult patients","RIDT-negative patients","atypical CAPs","hospitalized adults","rapid way","bacterial pneumonia","negative RIDTs","ILIs","anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy","atypical community","herald wave","oseltamivir","RT-PCR positivity","unexplained relative lymphopenia","extrapulmonary findings","unexplained increase","simple way","relative bradycardia","characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","SGPT","situations","illnesses","clinicians","SGOT","elevated serum transaminases","time-dependent","infection control dilemmas","basis","New York area","increased ferritin levels","following","Emergency Department","fact","accuracy","Conclusions","health departments","need","Background","maximum","key indicators","evaluation","Objective","mimics","decades","Methods","hypophosphatemia"],"language":"en"},

Here, taking a challenging classification found in coronaviruses, we argue that consideration of biological properties in addition to sequence-based demarcations is critical for generating useful taxonomy that recapitulates complex evolutionary histories. Within the Alphacoronavirus genus, the Alphacoronavirus 1 species encompasses several biologically distinct viruses. We carried out functionally based phylogenetic analysis, centered on the spike gene, which encodes the main surface antigen and primary driver of tropism and pathogenesis. Within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species, we identify clade A (encompassing serotype I feline coronavirus [FCoV] and canine coronavirus [CCoV]) and clade B (grouping serotype II FCoV and CCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]-like viruses). We propose this clade designation, along with the newly proposed Alphacoronavirus 2 species, as an improved way to classify the Alphacoronavirus genus. IMPORTANCE Our work focuses on improving the classification of the Alphacoronavirus genus. The Alphacoronavirus 1 species groups viruses of veterinary importance that infect distinct mammalian hosts and includes canine and feline coronaviruses and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. It is the prototype species of the Alphacoronavirus genus; however, it encompasses biologically distinct viruses. To better characterize this prototypical species, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the spike protein, one of the main determinants of tropism and pathogenesis, and reveal the existence of two subgroups or clades that fit with previously established serotype demarcations. We propose a new clade designation to better classify Alphacoronavirus 1 members.","publish_time":"2018-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whittaker, Gary R.; Andr\u00E9, Nicole M.; Millet, Jean Kaoru","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1340cfab5e9d9c4e29144766f379fe8f10e4cc29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5750389.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299531/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mspheredirect.00463-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Alphacoronavirus genus","proposed Alphacoronavirus","prototypical species","prototype species","distinct viruses","species groups viruses of veterinary importance","virus taxonomy","clade B","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","new clade designation","FCoV","canine coronavirus","feline coronaviruses","CCoV","useful taxonomy","encompassing serotype","established serotype demarcations","pathogenesis","sequence-based demarcations","useful viral classification","challenging classification","main determinants of tropism","distinct mammalian hosts","spike protein","spike gene","phylogenetic analyses","phylogenetic analysis","main surface antigen","primary driver of tropism","addition","TGEV","generation sequencing","recent advances","consideration of biological properties","improved way","clades","sequences","complex evolutionary histories","field","metagenomics","existence","question","subgroups","work","difficulties","members"],"language":"en"},

We have developed a HRSV subgroup-specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detection and subgroup identification using primers and subgroup-specific probes targeting a conserved region of the nucleoprotein gene combined in a single duplex reaction using all genome sequence data currently available in GenBank. The assay was validated for analytical sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and clinical performance with a geographically diverse collection of viral isolates and respiratory specimens in direct comparison with an established pan-HRSV rRT-PCR reference test. The assay was sensitive, reproducibly detecting as few as 5\u201310 copies/reaction of target RNA.

IBV causes a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory tract and, depending on the strain, other tissues including the reproductive and urogenital tract. The control of IBV in the field is hampered by the many different strains circulating worldwide and the limited protection across strains due to serotype diversity. This diversity is believed to be due to the amino acid variation in the S1 domain of the major viral attachment protein spike. In the last years, much effort has been undertaken to address the role of the avian coronavirus spike protein in the various steps of the virus\u2019 live cycle. Various models have successfully been developed to elucidate the contribution of the spike in binding of the virus to cells, entry of cell culture cells and organ explants, and the in vivo tropism and pathogenesis. This review will give an overview of the literature on avian coronavirus spike proteins with particular focus on our recent studies on binding of recombinant soluble spike protein to chicken tissues.

Comparison of the sequences preferred by practitioners to those recommended, suggested that no single recommendation is entirely satisfactory. We suggest that recommendations be replaced with a scoring system incorporating empirical frequencies such as those reported here.","publish_time":"2004-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Onodera, Kenji; Melcher, Ulrich","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8741a6a2f6c5af7585ba60b367c7a550cea4a1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127618.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850804000520; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850804000520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["end triplets of PCR primer sequences","empirical recommendations","key component of PCR primer design","PCR primers","empirical frequencies","viral genome sequences","base compositions","refereed journal articles","scoring system","apparent preferences","VirOligo database","single recommendation","Comparison","practitioners","theoretical considerations","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Methods The Ethic Committee of our institution approved the protocol of this study and waived the requirement for patient informed consent. Two hundreds and ninety-five patients were enrolled in this study (healthy person: 149; COVID-19 patients: 146), which were divided into three separate non-overlapping cohorts (training set, n=135, healthy person, n=69, patients, n=66; validation set, n=20, healthy person, n=10, patients, n=10; test set, n=140, healthy person, n=70, patients, n=70). The DenseNet was trained and tested to classify the images as having manifestation of COVID-19 or as healthy. A radiologist also blindly evaluated all the test images and rechecked the misdiagnosed cases by DenseNet. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess the model performance. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DenseNet model and radiologist were also calculated. Results The DenseNet algorithm model yielded an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.958-1.0) in the validation set and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.972-0.995) in the test set. The threshold value was selected as 0.8, while for validation and test sets, the accuracies were 95% and 92%, the sensitivities were 100% and 97%, the specificities were 90% and 87%, and the F1 values were 95% and 93%, respectively. The sensitivity of radiologist was 94%, the specificity was 96%, while the accuracy was 95%. Conclusions Deep learning (DL) with DenseNet can accurately classify COVID-19 on HRCT with an AUC of 0.98, which can reduce the miss diagnosis rate (combined with radiologists\u0027 evaluation) and radiologists\u0027 workload.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Shuyi; Jiang, Longquan; Cao, Zhuoqun; Wang, Liya; Cao, Jiawang; Feng, Rui; Zhang, Zhiyong; Xue, Xiangyang; Shi, Yuxin; Shan, Fei","journal":"Annals of translational medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.03.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","healthy person","validation set","accuracy of DenseNet model","DenseNet algorithm model","training set","test images","detection of COVID","manifestation of COVID","test sets","sensitivity of radiologist","study","HRCT","specificity","model performance","radiologists\u0027 evaluation","radiologists\u0027 workload","features","high resolution computed tomography","separate non-overlapping cohorts","areas","ROC","institution","Convolutional Networks","characteristic curves","diagnostic efficacy","requirement","misdiagnosed cases","miss diagnosis rate","Ethic Committee","patient informed consent","Methods","Receiver","protocol","accuracies","Conclusions Deep learning","AUCs","Background","F1 values","threshold value","hundreds","sensitivities","specificities"],"language":"en"},

Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients. Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs.

While vaccination is broadly used in an effort to prevent BRD, it is far from being fully protective and cases diagnosed from a combination of observed clinical signs without any attempt at identifying the causal pathogens are usually treated with antibiotics. Dairy and beef cattle losses from BRD are profound worldwide and genetic studies have now been initiated to elucidate host loci which underlie susceptibility with the objective of enabling molecular breeding to reduce disease prevalence. In this study, we employed RNA sequencing to examine the bronchial lymph node transcriptomes of controls and beef cattle which had individually been experimentally challenged with bovine respiratory syncytial virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica or Mycoplasma bovis to identify the genes that are involved in the bovine immune response to infection. We found that 142 differentially expressed genes were located in previously described quantitative trait locus regions associated with risk of BRD. Mutations affecting the expression or amino acid composition of these genes may affect disease susceptibility and could be incorporated into molecular breeding programs. Genes involved in innate immunity were generally found to be differentially expressed between the control and pathogen-challenged animals suggesting that variation in these genes may lead to a heritability of susceptibility that is pathogen independent. However, we also found pathogen-specific expression profiles which suggest that host genetic variation for BRD susceptibility is pathogen dependent.","publish_time":"2015-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tizioto, Polyana C.; Kim, JaeWoo; Seabury, Christopher M.; Schnabel, Robert D.; Gershwin, Laurel J.; Van Eenennaam, Alison L.; Toaff-Rosenstein, Rachel; Neibergs, Holly L.; Taylor, Jeremy F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7f5828ffb5dbc51bda8427bc64056b6eeb1afb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4484807.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121276/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BRD susceptibility","genes","disease susceptibility","bovine respiratory disease","risk of BRD","heritability of susceptibility","bovine viral diarrhea virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","pathogen dependent","pathogen independent","infectious bovine rhinotracheitis","bovine immune response","host genetic variation","viral pathogens","pathogen-specific expression profiles","infection","disease prevalence","beef cattle losses","molecular breeding programs","genetic studies","host loci","causal pathogens","Pasteurella multocida","Mannheimia haemolytica","bronchial lymph node transcriptomes of controls","Mycoplasma bovis","amino acid composition","quantitative trait locus regions","RNA sequencing","multi-factorial","combination","attempt","stress","objective","animals","clinical signs","conjunction","Mutations","cases","study","antibiotics","innate immunity","effort","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: From August 2010 through July 2011, 57 outpatient healthcare providers in 12 US sites reported weekly the number of visits for ILI and ARI and collected respiratory specimens on a subset for viral testing. The incidence was estimated using the number of patients in the practice as the denominator, and the virus-specific incidence of clinic visits was extrapolated from the proportion of patients testing positive. RESULTS: The age-adjusted cumulative incidence of outpatient visits for ARI and ILI combined was 95/1000 persons, with a viral etiology identified in 58% of specimens. Most frequently detected were rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (RV/EV) (21%) and influenza viruses (21%); the resulting extrapolated incidence of outpatient visits was 20 and 19/1000 persons respectively. The incidence of influenza virus-associated clinic visits was highest among patients aged 2\u201317 years, whereas other viruses had varied patterns among age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The IISP provides a unique opportunity to estimate the outpatient respiratory illness burden by etiology. Influenza virus infection and RV/EV infection(s) represent a substantial burden of respiratory disease in the US outpatient setting, particularly among children.","publish_time":"2013-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fowlkes, Ashley; Giorgi, Andrea; Erdman, Dean; Temte, Jon; Goodin, Kate; Di Lonardo, Steve; Sun, Yumei; Martin, Karen; Feist, Michelle; Linz, Rachel; Boulton, Rachelle; Bancroft, Elizabeth; McHugh, Lisa; Lojo, Jose; Filbert, Kimberly; Finelli, Lyn","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ae77f33c915e2f68583b563830ac5309ee02238.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5749912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24338352/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit806; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/209/11/1715/16866596/jit806.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project","ILI","RV/EV","IISP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cumulative incidence of outpatient visits","resulting extrapolated incidence of outpatient visits","incidence of influenza virus-associated clinic visits","outpatient acute respiratory infection","outpatient respiratory illness burden","Influenza virus infection","virus-specific incidence of clinic visits","respiratory specimens","number of visits","Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project","influenza viruses","US outpatient setting","respiratory symptoms","outpatient healthcare providers","EV infection","ILI criteria","number of patients","viral etiology","viral testing","substantial burden of respiratory disease","IISP","proportion of patients","persons","contribution of associated viral etiologies","US sites","age groups","unique opportunity","varied patterns","denominator","BACKGROUND","subset","rhinoviruses","enteroviruses","years","practice","children","presence","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Comparisons of plaque assays before and after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing inactivation of aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied voltage. At 30 kV and an air flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of infective virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction represented ~2 log of the MS2 inactivated and ~0.35 log physically removed in the packed bed. Increasing the air flow rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not significantly impact virus inactivation effectiveness.

Inactivation procedures with Triton X-100 0.1% and/or heat are currently recommended, but have unknown effects on the accuracy of serological testing. Furthermore, virus inactivation by Triton X-100 0.1% was shown to be ineffective in serum. This study aimed to demonstrate virus inactivation in serum by Triton X-100 1% and maintained accuracy of serological testing. Methods A panel of 19 serological tests was run on patient serum samples after treatment with Triton X-100 1%, 0.1%, and 0.1% \u002B heat inactivation at 60\u00B0C for 1 h. Mean differences between measurements (bias) were calculated applying the Bland\u2013Altman method. To determine effectiveness of virus inactivation, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) was spiked into medium containing 90% or 1% serum, and treated with Triton X-100 0.1% or 1%. Infectious titres were then determined on Vero cells. Results Serological measurements showed good agreement between controls and samples treated with Triton X-100 0.1% and 1%, with an estimated bias of 0.6 \u00B1 9.2% (n = 258) and \u20130.1 \u00B1 18.6% (n = 174), respectively. Discordant qualitative results were rare. Conversely, heat inactivation alone and combined with Triton X-100 0.1% triggered a bias of 17.5 \u00B1 66.4% (n = 200) and 37.9 \u00B1 79.8% (n = 160), respectively. Triton X-100 1% completely inactivated HSV-1 in 1% and 90% serum while Triton X-100 0.1% failed to do so in 90% serum. Conclusions Unlike heat inactivation, Triton X-100 1% enabled accurate serological testing and completely inactivated HSV-1 in serum. This simple method could allow safe routine serological diagnostics in high-risk patients.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Remy, M. M.; Alfter, M.; Chiem, M.-N.; Barbani, M.

In this commentary, we briefly introduce the situation of hospitalized patients with severe mental illness and suggest some effective measures that should be rapidly undertaken to reverse current challenges.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shen; Zhang, Yong","journal":"Gen Psychiatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ccd36ab256cb9d3827a19bcb4b8d1c139cdaf82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7174023.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363326/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe mental illness","hospitalised patients","Psychiatric patients","COVID","situation of hospitalized patients","mental healthcare of different types of population groups","concern","pneumonia epidemic","experts","vulnerable group","effective measures","coronavirus disease","attention","respect","outbreak","China","current challenges","commentary"],"language":"en"},

There are many detailed investigations of PrP, but proteomic studies of other proteins in verified infectious TSE particles have not been pursued, even though brain homogenates without PrP retain their complete infectious titer. To define proteins that may be integral to, process, or protect an agent genome, we developed a streamlined, high\u2010yield purification of infectious FU\u2010CJD mouse brain particles with minimal PrP. Proteinase K (PK) abolished all residual particle PrP, but did not reduce infectivity, and viral\u2010size particles lacking PrP were \u223C70S (vs. 90\u2013120S without PK). Furthermore, over 1,500 non\u2010PrP proteins were still present and positively identified in high titer FU\u2010CJD particles without detectable PrP by mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS); 114 of these peptides were linked to viral motifs in the environmental\u2013viral database, and not evident in parallel uninfected controls. Host components were also identified in both PK and non\u2010PK treated particles from FU\u2010CJD mouse brain and human sCJD brain. This abundant cellular data had several surprises, including finding Huntingtin in the sCJD but not normal human brain samples. Similarly, the neural Wiskott\u2013Aldrich sequence and multivesicular and endosome components associated with retromer APP (Alzheimer amyloid) processing were only in sCJD. These cellular findings suggest that new therapies directed at retromer\u2013vesicular trafficking in other neurodegenerative diseases may also counteract late\u2010onset sCJD PrP amyloid pathology.

The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loeffelholz, Michael J.; Tang, Yi-Wei","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/132375358de5fda800e6b1d8aedf2091e4bc7ba6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196430/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1745095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fast diagnostic testing methods","laboratory diagnostic methods","human coronavirus infections","Newer laboratory methods","current laboratory methods available","testing coronaviruses","repeated testing","coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus","accurate diagnosis of SARS","development of novel assays","emerging ones","nasopharyngeal swab","Nasopharyngeal specimens","deeper specimen","HCoV","availability of updated tests","burden","point","collection method","presentation","molecular devices","local hospitals","clinics","COVID","beginning","likelihood","necessity","time","conventional gold standards","production of purulent sputum","century","nasopharynx increases","Viral pneumonias","Wuhan","patients","bronchoscopy"],"language":"en"},

Infection of these cell types has been proposed to contribute to the inflammation, activation of coagulation cascades and ineffective immune responses characteristic of filovirus hemorrhagic fever. However, many aspects of filovirus-APC interactions remain to be clarified. Among the unanswered questions: What determines the ability of filoviruses to replicate in different APC subsets? What are the cellular signaling pathways that sense infection and lead to production of copious quantities of cytokines, chemokines and tissue factor? What are the mechanisms by which innate antiviral responses are disabled by these viruses, and how may these mechanisms contribute to inadequate adaptive immunity? A better understanding of these issues will clarify the pathogenesis of filoviral hemorrhagic fever and provide new avenues for development of therapeutics.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez, Osvaldo; Leung, Lawrence W.; Basler, Christopher F.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2a5f901123674b952604b4729f4ba06b1f705a7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/aac12370d5b7a1000d6596fc2ad77d656a5c6745.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3299938.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354212000332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354212000332; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3299938?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22333482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["filovirus infection","aspects of filovirus","mechanisms","ineffective immune responses characteristic of filovirus hemorrhagic fever","pathogenesis of filoviral hemorrhagic fever","antiviral responses","dendritic cells","ability of filoviruses","APC interactions","different APC subsets","emerging pathogens","activation of coagulation cascades","new avenues","lethal zoonotic agents of concern","production of copious quantities of cytokines","chemokines","lead","issues","MARV","potential bioweapons","EBOV","APCs","macrophages","tissue factor","development of therapeutics","marburgvirus","inflammation","inadequate adaptive immunity","ebolavirus","pathways","better understanding","unanswered questions","Antigen","cell types"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the time of entry of swine influenza into the Finnish pig population. We also describe the molecular detection of two types of influenza A (H1N1) viruses in porcine samples submitted in 2009 and 2010. This retrospective study was based on three categories of samples: blood samples collected for disease monitoring from pigs at major slaughterhouses from 2007 to 2009; blood samples from pigs in farms with a special health status taken in 2008 and 2009; and diagnostic blood samples from pigs in farms with clinical signs of respiratory disease in 2008 and 2009. The blood samples were tested for influenza A antibodies with an antibody ELISA. Positive samples were further analyzed for H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 antibodies with a hemagglutination inhibition test. Diagnostic samples for virus detection were subjected to influenza A M-gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and to pandemic influenza A H1N1-specific real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were further analyzed with RT-PCRs designed for this purpose, and the PCR products were sequenced and sequences analyzed phylogenetically. RESULTS: In the blood samples from pigs in special health class farms producing replacement animals and in diagnostic blood samples, the first serologically positive samples originated from the period July\u2013August 2008. In samples collected for disease monitoring, \u003C 0.1%, 0% and 16% were positive for antibodies against influenza A H1N1 in the HI test in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Swine influenza A virus of avian-like H1N1 was first detected in diagnostic samples in February 2009. In 2009 and 2010, the avian-like H1N1 virus was detected on 12 and two farms, respectively. The pandemic H1N1 virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) was detected on one pig farm in 2009 and on two farms in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study, swine influenza of avian-like H1N1 virus was introduced into the Finnish pig population in 2008 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009. The source of avian-like H1N1 infection could not be determined. Cases of pandemic H1N1 in pigs coincided with the period when the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was spread in humans in Finland.","publish_time":"2013-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nokireki, Tiina; Laine, Taina; London, Laura; Ikonen, Niina; Huovilainen, Anita","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2558f92b15a62a49fdd0e7621ba97f1a4aa0080d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3850993.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047612/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-55-69","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["Diagnostic samples","Positive samples","pandemic H1N1 virus","diagnostic blood samples","categories of samples","porcine samples","H1N1 infection","pandemic influenza","swine influenza of avian","virus of avian","Cases of pandemic H1N1","types of influenza","pdm09 virus","virus detection","H1N1-specific real-time RT-PCR","disease monitoring","infectious acute respiratory disease of pigs","special health class farms","source of avian","Finnish pig population","gene-specific real-time RT-PCR","clinical signs of respiratory disease","H1N2 antibodies","PCR products","RT-PCRs","pig farm","period","special health status","HI test","molecular detection","retrospective study","hemagglutination inhibition test","replacement animals","major slaughterhouses","purpose","viruses","time of entry","humans","antibody ELISA","H3N2","BACKGROUND","sequences","Finland","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We developed a localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence fiber-optic biosensor (LSPCF-FOB) which combines a sandwich immunoassay with the LSP technique using antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of S-OIVs. The detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB for recombinant S-OIV H1 protein detection was estimated at 13.9 pg/mL, which is 10(3)-fold better than that of conventional capture ELISA when using the same capture antibodies. For clinical S-OIV isolates measurement, meanwhile, the detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB platform was calculated to be 8.25 \u00D7 10(4) copies/mL, compared with 2.06 \u00D7 10(6) copies/mL using conventional capture ELISA. Furthermore, in comparison with the influenza A/B rapid test, the detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB for S-OIV was almost 50-fold in PBS solution and 25-fold lower in mimic solution, which used nasal mucosa from healthy donors as the diluent. The findings of this study therefore indicate that the high detection sensitivity and specificity of the LSPCF-FOB make it a potentially effective diagnostic tool for clinical S-OIV infection and this technique has the potential to be applied to the development of other clinical microbe detection platforms.","publish_time":"2010-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Ying-Feng; Wang, Sheng-Fan; Huang, Jason C.; Su, Li-Chen; Yao, Ling; Li, Ying-Chang; Wu, Suh-Chin; Chen, Yi-Ming A.; Hsieh, Jo-Ping; Chou, Chien","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855191/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.08.060; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566310005762; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566310005762","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LSP","PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection limit","clinical S-OIV infection","LSPCF-FOB platform","proteins of S","recombinant S-OIV H1 protein detection","clinical S-OIV isolates measurement","influenza pandemic","clinical microbe detection platforms","high detection sensitivity","capture antibodies","control of influenza disease","Swine-origin influenza","conventional capture ELISA","virus","fold lower","new reassortant strain of influenza","copies","mimic solution","LSP technique","PBS solution","fluorescence fiber-optic biosensor","hemagglutinin","H1N1","nasal mucosa","effective diagnostic tool","B rapid test","localized surface plasmon","HA","development","specificity","sandwich immunoassay","healthy donors","timely diagnoses","diluent","potential","study","OIVs","comparison","pg","findings"],"language":"en"},

The ability of this metal to form organometallic compounds has contributed to the increase in the number of studies on the multidirectional biological activity of its various organic complexes in view of their application in medicine. OBJECTIVE: This review aims at summarizing the current state of knowledge of the pharmacological potential of V and the mechanisms underlying its anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-hypercholesterolemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective activity as well as the mechanisms of appetite regulation related to the possibility of using this element in the treatment of obesity. The toxicological potential of V and the mechanisms of its toxic action, which have not been sufficiently recognized yet, as well as key information about the essentiality of this metal, its physiological role, and metabolism with certain aspects on the timeline is collected as well. The report also aims to review the use of V in the implantology and industrial sectors emphasizing the human health hazard as well as collect data on the directions of further research on V and its interactions with Mg along with their character. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Multidirectional studies on V have shown that further analyses are still required for this element to be used as a metallodrug in the fight against certain life-threatening diseases. Studies on interactions of V with Mg, which showed that both elements are able to modulate the response in an interactive manner are needed as well, as the results of such investigations may help not only in recognizing new markers of V toxicity and clarify the underlying interactive mechanism between them, thus improving the medical application of the metals against modern-age diseases, but also they may help in development of principles of effective protection of humans against environmental/occupational V exposure.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scibior, Agnieszka; Pietrzyk, Lukasz; Plewa, Zbigniew; Skiba, Andrzej","journal":"J Trace Elem Med Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d50f17015379f502c00d212413adda443cf02c6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152879.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126508; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X20300730?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305626/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0946672X20300730","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interactions of V","use of V","anti-cancer","anti-hypercholesterolemic","anti-diabetic","pharmacological potential of V","toxicological potential of V","occupational V exposure","new markers of V toxicity","Multidirectional studies","number of studies","RESULTS","review","multidirectional biological activity","mechanisms of appetite regulation","certain life-threatening diseases","underlying interactive mechanism","neuroprotective activity","certain aspects","medical application","interactive manner","modern-age diseases","various organic complexes","effective protection of humans","industrial sectors","cardioprotective","human health hazard","metabolism","metals","physiological role","implantology","wide range of effects","current state of knowledge","data","response","essentiality","increase","fight","metallodrug","research","CONCLUSIONS","mammalian organism","development of principles","organometallic compounds","timeline","possibility","directions","Vanadium","key information","toxic action","elements","ability","medicine","treatment of obesity","BACKGROUND","analyses","report","OBJECTIVE","investigations","character"],"language":"en"},

However, two main factors complicate genomic surveillance. First, pathogens exhibiting high genetic diversity demand higher levels of scrutiny to obtain an accurate representation of the entire population. Second, current systems of detection are nonuniform, with significant gaps in certain geographic locations and animal reservoirs. Despite past unforeseen pandemics like the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, there is no standardized way of evaluating surveillance. A more complete surveillance system should capture a greater proportion of pathogen diversity. Here we present a novel quantitative method of assessing the completeness of genomic surveillance that incorporates the time of sequence collection, as well as the pathogen\u2019s evolutionary rate. We propose the q2 coefficient, which measures the proportion of sequenced isolates whose closest neighbor in the past is within a genetic distance equivalent to 2 years of evolution, roughly the median time of changing strain selection for influenza A vaccines. Easily interpretable and significantly faster than other methods, the q2 coefficient requires no full phylogenetic characterization or use of arbitrary clade definitions. Application of the q2 coefficient to influenza A virus confirmed poor sampling of swine and avian populations and identified regions with deficient surveillance. We demonstrate that the q2 coefficient can not only be applied to other pathogens, including dengue and West Nile viruses, but also used to describe surveillance dynamics, particularly the effects of different public health policies.","publish_time":"2013-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Joseph M.; Rabadan, Raul","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f7394c2575f1eb1a196c9f19cd4b57ddd05789b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3560527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362319/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00524-12","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["deficient surveillance","surveillance dynamics","q2 coefficient","completeness of genomic surveillance","complete surveillance system","swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus","pathogens","popular method","greater proportion of pathogen diversity","origin of transmission","poor sampling of swine","detection of infectious disease","genetic distance equivalent","proportion of sequenced isolates","current systems of detection","past unforeseen pandemics","novel quantitative method","time of sequence collection","high genetic diversity demand higher levels of scrutiny","median time of changing strain selection","significant gaps","supplementing information","avian populations","certain geographic locations","serological techniques","nonuniform","phylogenetic characterization","host-determinant markers","years of evolution","closest neighbor","regions","effects of different public health policies","accurate representation","animal reservoirs","dengue","vaccines","methods","advent of deep sequencing","arbitrary clade definitions","West Nile viruses","standardized way","entire population","main factors","Application","pathogen\u2019s evolutionary rate"],"language":"en"},

The cell culture-derived subunit influenza vaccine (OPTAFLU\u00AE, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics) is produced using Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to propagate seasonal viral strains, as an alternative to embryonated chicken-eggs. As only a limited range of mammalian viruses can grow in MDCK cells, similar to embryonated eggs, MDCK cells can act as an effective filter for a wide range of adventitious agents that might be introduced during vaccine production. However, the introduction of an alternative cell substrate (for example, MDCK cells) into a vaccine manufacturing process requires thorough investigations to assess the potential for adventitious agent risk in the final product, in the unlikely event that contamination should occur. The risk assessment takes into account the entire manufacturing process, from initial influenza virus isolation, through to blending of the trivalent subunit vaccine and worst-case residual titres for the final vaccine formulation have been calculated for \u003E20 viruses or virus families. Maximum residual titres for all viruses tested were in the range of 10\u22126 to 10\u221216 infectious units per vaccine dose.

The response includes changes in the concentration of plasma proteins called acute phase proteins (APPs). Calf diarrhea is an important disease that occurs in association with the interaction of various infectious agents and calf susceptibility. The economic losses is associated with death loss and treatment costs, reduction of live weight gain, and reduction of productive life span, which may be considerable. The aim of the present study was to identify relationships among APPs in calves with diarrhea in the different clinical features. Holstein calves (50) within 1 day to 4 months old with signs of diarrhea and healthy calves (40) with similar age and sex were selected. Standard clinical examinations and also dehydration degree were carried out on each calf and were recorded. Calves with clinical signs of diarrhea were divided in different groups based on the severity of the clinical findings, fever and degree of dehydration. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein from all calves into vacutainers containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for separating plasma and without EDTA for serum biochemical analysis. APP [haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen (Fib), and ceruloplasmin (Cp)] concentrations were measured using validated standard methods. The results indicated a significant increases in APPs in diarrheic calves which was most obvious in Hp and SAA (P \u003C 0.001). Calves with severe clinical signs of diarrhea had a significant increases in their Hp and SAA (P \u003C 0.001) compared to calves with moderate or without systemic clinical signs. Diarrheic calves with fever compared to diarrheic calves without fever had a significant increases in their Hp and SAA (P \u003C 0.01). Also, diarrheic calves with severe dehydration compared to diarrheic calves with mild and moderate dehydration had significant increases in Hp and SAA (P \u003C 0.05), and these parameters (Hp, SAA, Fib, and Cp) among calves with mild and moderate dehydration had no significant changes. Our results indicated that monitoring the APP responses in diarrheic calves with different clinical signs could be useful as prognostic tools and facilitate treatment decisions.","publish_time":"2011-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hajimohammadi, Ali; Nazifi, Saeed; Ansari-Lari, Maryam; Khoshmanzar, Mohammad Reza; Bigdeli, Saeed Momeni","journal":"Comp Clin Path","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49861eebbc323ac1fda5c90a3f25b755300b7413.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214972/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00580-011-1390-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrheic calves","healthy calves","Holstein calves","Hp","SAA","different clinical signs","severe clinical signs of diarrhea","significant increases","systemic clinical signs","moderate dehydration","clinical findings","Calf diarrhea","different clinical features","dehydration degree","degree of dehydration","significant changes","severe dehydration","Standard clinical examinations","fever","APPs","acute phase proteins","EDTA","acute phase response","different groups","Cp","calf susceptibility","results","concentration of plasma proteins","separating plasma","treatment costs","serum amyloid","treatment decisions","APP responses","serum biochemical analysis","validated standard methods","reduction of live weight gain","reduction of productive life span","death loss","vacutainers","nonspecific inflammatory reaction","interaction of various infectious agents","prognostic tools","ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","association","concentrations","severity","relationships","jugular vein","months old","host","ceruloplasmin","fibrinogen","important disease","haptoglobin","day","present study","similar age","economic losses","parameters","Blood samples","aim","sex","tissue injury"],"language":"en"},

Exacerbations of asthma have been associated with bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections and air pollution. We correlated the asthma admission rates with fluctuations in respiratory virus activity and traffic-related air pollution, namely particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u226410\u03BCm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). A probabilistic risk assessment framework was developed based on a detrended fluctuation analysis to predict future respiratory virus and air pollutant associated asthma incidence. Results indicated a strong association between asthma admission rate and influenza (r =0.80, p \u003C0.05) and SO2 level (r =0.73, p \u003C0.05) in Taiwan in the period 2001\u20132008. No significant correlation was found for asthma admission and PM10, O3, NO2, and CO. The proposed fluctuation analysis provides a simple correlation exponent describing the complex interactions of respiratory viruses and air pollutants with asthma. This study revealed that there was a 95% probability of having exceeded 2987 asthma admissions per 100,000 population. It was unlikely (30% probability) that the asthma admission rate exceeded 3492 per 100,000 population. The probability of asthma admission risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping the correlation exponent of influenza to below 0.9. We concluded that fluctuation analysis based risk assessment provides a novel predictor of asthma incidence.","publish_time":"2011-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Chung-Min; Hsieh, Nan-Hung; Chio, Chia-Pin","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ccfc3b4b4cb4c7966569d165a1b120698ed9b69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112072.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21663946/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711005237; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.04.056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969711005237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["Abstract Asthma","asthma admissions","Exacerbations of asthma","asthma admission rates","probability of asthma admission risk","novel predictor of asthma incidence","air pollutants","respiratory virus activity","future respiratory virus","detrended fluctuation analysis","proposed fluctuation analysis","correlation exponent of influenza","traffic-related air pollution","NO2","PM10","simple correlation exponent","significant correlation","O3","population","complex interactions of respiratory viruses","viral respiratory tract infections","probabilistic risk assessment framework","nitrogen dioxide","sulfur dioxide","SO2 level","fluctuations","particulate matter","strong association","aerodynamic diameter","\u03BCm","carbon monoxide","growing epidemic","Results","ozone","Taiwan","period","study"],"language":"en"},

In this report, we showed that BTV, through its virulence non-structural protein NS3 (BTV-NS3), is able to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. In response to growth factors, the MAPK/ERK pathway activates cell survival, differentiation, proliferation and protein translation but can also lead to the production of several inflammatory cytokines. By combining immunoprecipitation of BTV-NS3 and mass spectrometry analysis from both BTV-infected and NS3-transfected cells, we identified the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF), a crucial player of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as a new cellular interactor of BTV-NS3. BRAF silencing led to a significant decrease of the MAPK/ERK activation by BTV supporting a model where BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF to activate this signaling cascade. Furthermore, the intrinsic ability of BTV-NS3 to bind BRAF and activate the MAPK/ERK pathway is conserved throughout multiple serotypes/strains but appears to be specific to BTV compared to other members of Orbivirus genus. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 reduced viral titers, suggesting that BTV manipulates this pathway for its own replication. Therefore, the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by BTV-NS3 could benefit to BTV replication by promoting its own viral protein synthesis but could also explain the deleterious inflammation associated with tissue damages as already observed in severe cases of BT disease. Altogether, our data provide molecular mechanisms to explain the role of BTV-NS3 as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis. Bluetongue Virus (BTV) is responsible of the non-contagious arthropod-borne disease Bluetongue (BT) transmitted to ruminants by blood-feeding midges. Despite the fact that BTV has been extensively studied, we still have little understanding of the molecular determinants of BTV virulence. In this report, we found that the virulence protein NS3 interacts with BRAF, a key component of the MAPK/ERK pathway. In response to growth factors, this pathway promotes cell survival, increases protein translation but also contributes to the production of inflammatory cytokines. We showed that BTV-NS3 enhances the MAPK/ERK pathway and this activation is BRAF-dependent.

The 3C\u2010like protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for viral replication and thus represents a potential target for antiviral drug development. Presently, very few data are available on MERS\u2010CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition by small molecules. We conducted extensive exploration of the pharmacophoric space of a recently identified set of peptidomimetic inhibitors of the bat HKU4\u2010CoV 3CL(pro). HKU4\u2010CoV 3CL(pro) shares high sequence identity (81%) with the MERS\u2010CoV enzyme and thus represents a potential surrogate model for anti\u2010MERS drug discovery. We used 2 well\u2010established methods: Quantitative structure\u2010activity relationship (QSAR)\u2010guided modeling and docking\u2010based comparative intermolecular contacts analysis. The established pharmacophore models highlight structural features needed for ligand recognition and revealed important binding\u2010pocket regions involved in 3CL(pro)\u2010ligand interactions. The best models were used as 3D queries to screen the National Cancer Institute database for novel nonpeptidomimetic 3CL(pro) inhibitors. The identified hits were tested for HKU4\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition. Two hits, which share the phenylsulfonamide fragment, showed moderate inhibitory activity against the MERS\u2010CoV 3CL(pro) and represent a potential starting point for the development of novel anti\u2010MERS agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pharmacophore modeling study supported by in vitro validation on the MERS\u2010CoV 3CL(pro). HIGHLIGHTS: MERS\u2010CoV is an emerging virus that is closely related to the bat HKU4\u2010CoV. 3CL(pro) is a potential drug target for coronavirus infection. HKU4\u2010CoV 3CL(pro) is a useful surrogate model for the identification of MERS\u2010CoV 3CL(pro) enzyme inhibitors. dbCICA is a very robust modeling method for hit identification. The phenylsulfonamide scaffold represents a potential starting point for MERS coronavirus 3CL(pro) inhibitors development.","publish_time":"2017-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abuhammad, Areej; Al\u2010Aqtash, Rua\u0027a A.; Anson, Brandon J.; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Taha, Mutasem O.","journal":"J Mol Recognit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/501ae7b9e307bf0050b9490f664c925a78ab9134.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f04dbab83bd2a6f8cbf16ce7968ca37fbb267415.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608547/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmr.2644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Cancer Institute","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV enzyme","MERS coronavirus","identification of MERS","anti\u2010MERS drug discovery","development of novel anti\u2010MERS agents","potential target","inhibitors development","bat HKU4","potential drug target","potential surrogate model","potential starting point","enzyme inhibitors","antiviral drug development","guided modeling","coronavirus infection","pharmacophore modeling study","emerging virus","set of peptidomimetic inhibitors","inhibition","best models","identified hits","useful surrogate model","robust modeling method","established pharmacophore models","activity relationship","novel nonpeptidomimetic","ligand recognition","phenylsulfonamide fragment","phenylsulfonamide scaffold","ligand interactions","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","moderate inhibitory activity","docking","QSAR","National Cancer Institute database","Quantitative structure","structural features","important binding","D queries","major challenge","comparative intermolecular contacts analysis","validation","well\u2010established methods","pharmacophoric space","pocket regions","viral replication","extensive exploration","clinical management","dbCICA","high sequence identity","small molecules","knowledge","protease","HIGHLIGHTS"],"language":"en"},

A small-molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV, exhibiting an effective concentration (EC(50)) of 23 \u03BCM in cell-based assays, was identified through virtual screening against a computer-predicted model of the cysteine proteinase. Screening against two crystal structures of the same proteinase failed to identify the 23-\u03BCM inhibitor.

Massive leakage of fluid from vascular space leads to lose of blood plasma and decrease of effective circulatory blood volume, resulting in formation of severe tissue edema, hypotension or even shock, especially in severe burn injury. Fluid resuscitation has been the only valid approach to sustain patient\u2019s blood volume for a long time, due to the lack of overall and profound understanding of the mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability response. There is an emerging concept in recent years that some so-called barrier stabilizing mediators play a positive role in preventing the increase of vascular permeability. These mediators may be released in response to proinflammatory mediators and serve to restore endothelial barrier function. Some of these stabilizing mediators are important even in quiescent state because they preserve basal vascular permeability at low levels. This review introduces some of these mediators and reveals their underlying signaling mechanisms during endothelial barrier enhancing process.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiao-bing, Huang; Min, Dong; Shuang-ming, Song","journal":"Chinese Journal of Traumatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a200f2179365e6c200ebb3ada3abdb12844ca36d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1008127515302790; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1008127515302790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stabilizing mediators","increase of vascular permeability","proinflammatory mediators","basal vascular permeability","mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability response","blood plasma","patient\u2019s blood volume","vascular space leads","so-called barrier","endothelial barrier function","severe burn injury","effective circulatory blood volume","Abstract Increase of microvascular permeability","Fluid resuscitation","important pathological events","Massive leakage of fluid","formation of severe tissue edema","shock","quiescent state","recent years","profound understanding","valid approach","hypotension","long time","positive role","lack of overall","pathogenesis of trauma","low levels","underlying","emerging concept","process","review"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: Our study was performed to investigate the role of enteric viruses in acute diarrhea in our country and to evaluate methods that could be used in routine diagnostics. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age seeking medical care for acute diarrhea during the winter season 2000/2001 in Beijing Children\u0027s Hospital. All specimens were initially screened microscopically for leucocytes/red blood cells. Samples with negative results were analyzed for virus presence using commercial EIAs and/or in-house RT-PCRs. RESULTS: At least one viral agent was found in 67% of the specimens. The frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus and enteric adenovirus was 59%, 8%, 6% and 2%, respectively. Dual infections were found in 9.0% (6/67) of the positive samples. The results from rotavirus and astrovirus EIAs were concordant with those of rotavirus and astrovirus RT-PCRs.

We propose a novel influenza vaccine composing a bacterial carrier and a plasmid cargo. In the immunized subjects, the bacterial carrier invades and releases its cargo into host cells where the plasmid expresses viral RNAs and proteins for reconstitution of attenuated influenza virus. Here we aimed to construct a mouse PolI-driven plasmid for efficient production of influenza virus. RESULTS: A plasmid was constructed to express all influenza viral RNAs and proteins. This all-in-one plasmid resulted in 10(5)\u201310(6) 50 % tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/mL of influenza A virus in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells on the third day post-transfection, and also reconstituted influenza virus in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. A 6-unit plasmid was constructed by deleting the HA and NA cassettes from the all-in-one plasmid. Cotransfection of BHK-21 cells with the 6-unit plasmid and the two other plasmids encoding the HA or NA genes resulted in influenza virus titers similar to those produced by the 1-plasmid method. CONCLUSIONS: An all-in-one plasmid and a 3-plasmid murine PolI-driven reverse genetics systems were developed, and efficiently reconstituted influenza virus in BHK-21 cells. The all-in-one plasmid may serve as a tool to determine the factors inhibiting virus generation from a large size plasmid. In addition, we recommend a simple and robust \u201C1 \u002B 2\u201D approach to generate influenza vaccine seed virus.","publish_time":"2015-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiangmin; Curtiss, Roy","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c63e2bbb0915e7d4d40813d58286d51e80453507.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4495709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26093583/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0321-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["all-in-one plasmid","plasmid cargo","unit plasmid","reconstituted influenza virus","plasmid method","seasonal influenza","influenza vaccine seed virus","plasmid murine PolI","efficient production of influenza virus","reconstitution of attenuated influenza virus","influenza virus titers similar","influenza viral RNAs","large size plasmid","novel influenza vaccine","virus generation","mouse PolI-driven plasmid","current influenza vaccines","host cells","bacterial carrier","proteins","Cotransfection of BHK","baby hamster kidney","NA genes","NA cassettes","Darby canine kidney","Chinese hamster ovary","MDCK","Madin","reverse genetics systems","plasmids","approach","sudden pandemic","tissue culture infective dose","TCID","factors","CHO","day post-transfection","tool","huge flocks of birds","timely manner","immunized subjects","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","addition","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Since the course of these infections is unpredictable with potential fast deterioration into respiratory failure, infants are easily admitted to the hospital for observation. The aim of this study was to examine whether systemic inflammatory markers can be used to predict severity of disease in children with respiratory viral infections. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal washings from children \u003C3 years of age with viral LRTI attending a hospital were collected within 24 hours (acute) and after 4\u20136 weeks (recovery). Patients were assigned to a mild (observation only), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) or severe (mechanical ventilation) group. Linear regression analysis was used to design a prediction rule using plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum amyloid P component and properdin. This rule was tested in a validation cohort. RESULTS: One hundred and four children (52% male) were included. A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was a better indicator of severe disease compared with any of the individual makers and age (69% sensitivity (95% CI 50 to 83), 90% specificity (95% CI 80 to 96)). Validation in 141 patients resulted in 71% sensitivity (95% CI 53 to 85), 87% specificity (95% CI 79 to 92), negative predictive value of 64% (95% CI 47 to 78) and positive predictive value of 90% (95% CI 82 to 95). The prediction rule was not able to identify patients with a mild course of disease. CONCLUSION: A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was able to identify children with a severe course of viral LRTI disease, even in children under 2 months of age. To assess the true impact on clinical management, these results should be validated in a prospective randomised control study.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahout, Inge M L; Brand, Kim H; Zomer, Aldert; van den Hurk, Wilhelma H; Schilders, Geurt; Brouwer, Marianne L; Neeleman, Chris; de Groot, Ronald; Ferwerda, Gerben","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca46502bc5b38f9453f31a3f34ba1711e98d83a9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/638c624925ed19a692dcd98a7285191537b1c7c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5734420.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28667205/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014596","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","respiratory viral infections","PTX3","properdin","SAA","severe course of viral LRTI disease","mild course of disease","Patients","Respiratory viruses","respiratory failure","combination of CRP","severity of disease","prediction rule","lower respiratory tract infections","better indicator of severe disease","years of age","months of age","RESULTS","sensitivity","observation","specificity","negative predictive value","positive predictive value","serum amyloid P component","major cause of hospital admissions","validation cohort","prospective randomised control study","plasma levels of C reactive protein","potential fast deterioration","LRTIs","nasogastric feeding","nasopharyngeal washings","infants","supplemental oxygen","mechanical ventilation","clinical management","Blood","INTRODUCTION","pentraxin","true impact","METHODS","systemic inflammatory markers","group","individual makers","Linear regression analysis","hours","CONCLUSION","weeks","recovery","aim","male"],"language":"en"},

PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (\u003E 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (\u003E 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (\u003E 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.","publish_time":"1995-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brim, Theresa A.; VanCott, John L.; Lunney, Joan K.; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac30a85f52cf03b717bc74e0f58099d4644fd329.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016524279405416P; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016524279405416P","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","PRCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent TGEV challenge","Virulent TGEV exposure","suckling pigs","Weaned pigs","day-old pigs","primed pigs","lymph nodes of TGEV","primary replication site of TGEV","rectal virus","PRCV exposure","nasal virus","virus-specific cell","PRCV infection","limited virus","age-matched control pigs","MLN","transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation","virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus","partial immunity","mediated immunity","Primary inoculation","cpm","contact PRCV-exposed sows","Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses","Substantial BLN proliferative responses","protective immunity","lactogenic immunity","partial protection","primary oronasal inoculation","anti-viral immune responses","contribution of cell","primary porcine respiratry coronavirus","nasal secretions","days old","increased percentages of T cell subsets","decreased number of diarrhea cases","proximity","mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues","lamina propria","contrast","counts","spleens","onset","serum antibody titers","possibility","failure","groups","mononuclear cells","small intestine","lower magnitude","results","minute","feces","Analyses"],"language":"en"},

This intersection of disciplines, however, has a rich history and is currently revitalized by newfound functions of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis in human diseases. Schizophrenia, in particular, fits this model as a disorder with gene and environmental roots that may be anchored in the immune system. In this context, the combination of a precisely timed pathogen exposure in a person with genetically encoded altered immunity may have especially destructive consequences for the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, significant components of immunity, such as the development of the immune response and the concept of immune tolerance, are largely dictated by the commensal residents of the microbiome. When this community of microbes is imbalanced, perhaps as the result of a pathogen invasion, stress, or immune gene deficiency, a pathological cycle of localized inflammation, endothelial barrier compromise, translocation of gut-derived products, and systemic inflammation may ensue. If these pathologies enable access of gut and microbial metabolites and immune molecules to the CNS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and studies of the gut-brain axis support this hypothesis, a worsening of cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms is predicted to occur in susceptible individuals with schizophrenia. In this chapter, we review the role of microbes in various stages of this model and how these organisms may contribute to documented phenotypes of schizophrenia. An increased understanding of the role of pathogens and the microbiome in psychiatric disorders will better guide the development of microbial and immune-based therapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Severance, Emily G.; Yolken, Robert H.","journal":"Neuroinflammation and Schizophrenia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e01b3800e767b26ac5ac12551fe8e02a7baf1032.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6732248.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2018_84; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune system","immune molecules","immune response","gut-brain axis","immune gene deficiency","microbiome","immune-based therapeutics","concept of immune tolerance","translocation of gut","access of gut","context of psychiatric disorders","blood-brain barrier","CNS","development of microbial","psychiatric symptoms","model","role of microbes","documented phenotypes of schizophrenia","microbial metabolites","systemic inflammation","role of pathogens","pathogen invasion","altered immunity","community of microbes","endothelial barrier compromise","timed pathogen exposure","central nervous system","significant components of immunity","pathological cycle of localized inflammation","destructive consequences","stress","hypothesis","derived products","worsening of cognitive deficits","bacteria","fungi","person","disease prevention","protozoa","studies","viruses","archaea","treatment","result","combination","BBB","various stages","human diseases","environmental roots","increased understanding","newfound functions","pathologies","study of microorganisms","susceptible individuals","rich history","commensal residents","intersection of disciplines","chapter"],"language":"en"},

They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hussein, Islam T.M.; Haseeb, Abdul; Haque, Absarul; Mir, Mohammad A.","journal":"Advances in Applied Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee5a1760981ffbbebecefeea856263d32264ca61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150226.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123870223000069; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-387022-3.00006-9; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123870223000069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21459193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","HFRS","HCPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","viral attachment","RNA replicase","viral ribonucleocapsids","treatment of hantavirus","replication of viral genome","N protein","genomic RNA segments","translation of viral mRNA","infected cells","Abstract Hantaviruses","hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome","alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases","major roles","treatment of HFRS","fatal diseases","Gc","host cells","associated diseases","tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome","antiviral therapeutics","RdRp functions","antiviral therapy","HCPS","emerging zoonotic pathogens","molecular details of hantavirus life cycle","renal syndrome","important roles","effective vaccine","design of potential antiviral drug","genomic RNAs","envelope glycoproteins","nucleocapsid protein","major structural component","infected rodent hosts","entry","development","centers","assembly","hemorrhagic fever","transcription","aerosolized excreta","packaging of new virions","CDC","infection","virulence","conjunction","transcriptase","disease control","human health","serious threat","encapsidate","identification of targets","humans","main function","prevention","category","precursor glycoprotein","necessity","Bunyaviridae family","Recent studies","addition","endonuclease activity"],"language":"en"},

Since LCL are latently infected with EBV, they provide a model system to investigate EBV latency and virus-driven B cell proliferation and tumorigenesis(1). LCL have been used to present antigens in a variety of immunologic assays(2, 3). In addition, LCL can be used to generate human monoclonal antibodies(4, 5) and provide a potentially unlimited source when access to primary biologic materials is limited(6, 7). A variety of methods have been described to generate LCL. Earlier methods have included the use of mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide(8), and pokeweed mitogen(9) to increase the efficiency of EBV-mediated immortalization. More recently, others have used immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A to inhibit T cell-mediated killing of infected B cells(7, 10-12). The considerable length of time from EBV infection to establishment of cell lines drives the requirement for quicker and more reliable methods for EBV-driven B cell growth transformation. Using a combination of high titer EBV and an immunosuppressive agent, we are able to consistently infect, transform, and generate LCL from B cells in peripheral blood. This method uses a small amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are infected in vitroclusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23 with EBV in the presence of FK506, a T cell immunosuppressant. Traditionally, outgrowth of proliferating B cells is monitored by visualization of microscopic clusters of cells about a week after infection with EBV. Clumps of LCL can be seen by the naked eye after several weeks. We describe an assay to determine early if EBV-mediated growth transformation is successful even before microscopic clusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23(hi)CD58(\u002B) cells observed as early as three days post-infection indicates a successful outcome.","publish_time":"2011-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui-Yuen, Joyce; McAllister, Shane; Koganti, Siva; Hill, Erik; Bhaduri-McIntosh, Sumita","journal":"J Vis Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c919c2857ddedf0a444aa214761e16e4676d50b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3308597.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3791/3321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22090023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV infection","Infection of B cells","infected B cells","EBV latency","efficiency of EBV","vitroclusters of cells","EBV-driven B cell growth transformation","EBV-mediated growth transformation","outgrowth of proliferating B cells","Clumps of LCL","virus-driven B cell proliferation","visualization of microscopic clusters of cells","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","establishment of cell lines","combination of high titer EBV","T cell immunosuppressant","establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines","variety of methods","mediated immortalization","presence of CD23","reliable methods","days post-infection","Earlier methods","presence of FK506","successful outcome","subsequent immortalization","immunosuppressive agents","Epstein-Barr virus","variety of immunologic assays","requirement","access","primary biologic materials","unlimited source","present antigens","model system","considerable length of time","use of mitogens","cyclosporin","tumorigenesis","lipopolysaccharide","phytohemagglutinin","CD58","naked eye","human monoclonal antibodies","weeks","pokeweed mitogen","addition"],"language":"en"},

The nephropathogenic IBV strains cause nephritis and kidney lesions intrinsically and the pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, SPF chicks were infected with three nephropathogenic IBVs of different virulence and their gene expression profiles in chicken kidney were compared at transcriptome level. As a result, 1279 differentially expressed (DE) genes were found in very virulent SCDY2 inoculated group, 145 in virulent SCK2 group and 74 in non-virulent LDT3-A group when compared to mock infected group. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on SCDY2 group displayed that the up-regulated DE genes were mainly involved in cell apoptosis, and the down-regulated genes were involved in metabolic processes and DNA replication. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis showed that DE genes in SCDY2 group formed a network, and the core of the network was composed by cell apoptosis and immune response proteins. The clustering of gene expression profile among the three virus inoculated groups indicated that the majority of up-regulated DE genes on apoptosis in very virulent SCDY2 group were up-regulated more or less in virulent SCK2 group and those down-regulated on innate immune response in SCDY2 group were also down-regulated differently in SCK2 group. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells detected experimentally in kidney tissue were very different among the three virus inoculated groups and were positively accordant with the viral titer, kidney lesions and viral virulence of each group. Taken all together, the present study revealed that virulent nephropathogenic IBV infection modified a number of gene expression and induction of apoptosis in kidney cells may be a major pathogenic determinant for virulent nephropathogenic IBV.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Hui; Yang, Xin; Zhang, Zhikun; Li, Jianan; Zou, Wencheng; Zeng, Fanya; Wang, Hongning","journal":"Microbial Pathogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/add074d0144e54961e513a1c4732ee443996d8d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126322.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401017309051; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.11.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401017309051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29174688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontology"],"organizations":["IBV","DE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent SCDY2 group","virulent SCK2 group","virulent SCDY2 inoculated group","regulated genes","mock infected group","virulent nephropathogenic IBV infection","kidney lesions","chicken kidney","kidney cells","kidney tissue","number of gene expression","cell apoptosis","gene expression profiles","virus inoculated groups","induction of apoptosis","Gene Ontology","nephropathogenic IBVs of different virulence","clustering of gene expression profile","nephropathogenic IBV strains cause nephritis","viral virulence","present study","network","major pathogenic determinant","number of apoptotic cells","immune response proteins","innate immune response","Protein-Protein Interaction","viral titer","pathogenic mechanism","Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis virus","major poultry pathogen","KEGG pathway enrichment analysis","nephritic diseases","metabolic processes","PPI","serious economic loss","majority","SPF chicks","non-virulent LDT3","DNA replication","addition","transcriptome level","core","result"],"language":"en"},

Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases.

No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.

In Escherichia coli, some rare codons, which can limit the expression level of exogenous protein, have been defined by gene engineering operations. Previous studies have confirmed the existence of codon pair\u0027s preference in many genomes, but the underlying cause of this bias has not been well established. Here we focus on the patterns of rarely-used synonymous codons. A novel method was introduced to identify the rare codons merely by codon pair bias in Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In Escherichia coli, we defined the \u0022rare codon pairs\u0022 by calculating the frequency of occurrence of all codon pairs in coding sequences. Rare codons which are disliked in genes could make great contributions to forming rare codon pairs. Meanwhile our investigation showed that many of these rare codon pairs contain termination codons and the recognized sites of restriction enzymes. Furthermore, a new index (F(rare)) was developed. Through comparison with the classical indices we found a significant negative correlation between F(rare )and the indices which depend on reference datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach suggests that we can identify rare codons by studying the context in which a codon lies. Also, the frequency of rare codons (F(rare)) could be a useful index of codon bias regardless of the lack of expression abundance information.","publish_time":"2010-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xianming; Wu, Songfeng; Li, Dong; Zhang, Jiyang; Hou, Lin; Ma, Jie; Liu, Wanlin; Ren, Daming; Zhu, Yunping; He, Fuchu","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/785c02793ebb05bb4bf3c0784fe36fd0715190dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2828438.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-61; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20109184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rare codon pairs","frequency of rare codons","codon pair bias","termination codons","useful index of codon bias","synonymous codons","existence of codon pair\u0027s preference","Escherichia coli","control of gene expression","classical indices","frequency of occurrence","lack of expression abundance information","expression level of exogenous protein","new index","gene engineering operations","significant negative correlation","genomes","great contributions","recognized sites of restriction enzymes","important role","genes","coding sequences","underlying cause","context","Previous studies","reference datasets","comparison","patterns","approach","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","novel method","CONCLUSIONS","investigation"],"language":"en"},

This review examines the literature on this topic, and concludes that for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses.","publish_time":"2013-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saxena, Manvendra; Van, Thi Thu Hao; Baird, Fiona J.; Coloe, Peter J.; Smooker, Peter M.","journal":"Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5bdf18567bb3760e1ce05008135f0270badbd5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3542731.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23175507/; https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.049601-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial vectors","delivery vectors","vaccine vectors","employed vectors","viral vectors pre-existing immunity","viral pathogens","pre-existing immune responses","potential","subsequent immune response","safe form of vaccination","mediated responses","subsequent induction of cell","means of simultaneous vaccination","successful attenuation of multiple bacterial","hindrance","adenovirus","published studies","heterologous antigens","example Salmonella","vectored antigen","host","cases","enhancement","immunogenicity","general consensus","century","topic","fact","review","literature","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

The acute flaccid paralysis detected in the USA and Canada among children with EV-D68 infection has raised concerns about the aetiological role of this EV serotype in severe neurological disease. The circulation of EV-D68 in the general European population seems to be low, but European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends being vigilant to new cases, particularly in severely ill hospitalised patients. In October 2014, enteroviruses were detected in respiratory samples collected from five hospitalised patients, children and adults. Phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 sequences confirmed that the detected enteroviruses belonged to the D68 serotype, which were also similar to strains reported in USA (2014). However, all five patients developed respiratory symptoms, but only one required ICU admission. None of the patients described had symptoms of neurological disease. Other considerations related to the detection methods used for the diagnosis of respiratory enteroviruses are also discussed. In conclusion, additional evidence has been provided that supports the role of EV-D68 in respiratory infections in hospitalised patients.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gimferrer, Laura; Campins, Magda; Codina, Maria Gema; Esperalba, Juliana; Martin, Maria del Carmen; Fuentes, Francisco; Pumarola, Tomas; Anton, Andres","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63cc456cd99682083f8e6b73e1e48bc2f8d48538.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125865.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X15000518; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2015.01.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X15000518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25735714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Enterovirus","European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV-D68 infection","severe respiratory disease","EV serotype","D68 serotype","role of EV","respiratory symptoms","respiratory infections","circulation of EV","respiratory samples","diagnosis of respiratory enteroviruses","USA","ill hospitalised patients","detected enteroviruses","severe neurological disease","symptoms of neurological disease","Disease Prevention","Canada","substantial hospitalisation of children","European Centre","aetiological role","general European population","Control","Phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 sequences","ECDC","concerns","new cases","detection methods","acute flaccid paralysis","required ICU admission","adults","outbreaks of Enterovirus","conclusion","additional evidence","considerations","strains"],"language":"en"},

It is now accepted that it will take decades to eliminate the H5N1 virus in poultry and \u2018unconventional\u2019 response approaches have been called for. Drawing on increased understandings of the epizoosis over the last 10 years, this paper investigates what conditions are required if such innovative approaches are to be generated. It argues that addressing the spread and persistence of avian influenza is primarily a political matter, and if approaches appropriate for enzooticity are to be devised, the social, political, and economic dynamics of the disease and responses to it need to be identified and prioritised. A dominant response strategy focused on outbreak events, containment and eradication has obscured these important dynamics. If innovative \u2018unconventional\u2019 responses are to be generated, a wider range of perspectives and expertise needs to be engaged.

In this second part, the diagnostic applications of cytology in respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, ocular, and central nervous system tissues are discussed with a section describing fluid analysis in veterinary medicine. As noted in the previous manuscript, which characterized the cytology of the skin/subcutis, musculoskeletal, and lymphoid tissues, the interpretation of veterinary cytology samples must be undertaken with extensive knowledge of the breadth of animal species, including familiarity with the frequency and clinical progression of diseases, both of which can be influenced by species, breed, and husbandry conditions. Similar to part one, this review focuses on the most common domestic companion animal species (dog, cat, and horse) and highlights lesions that are either unique to veterinary species or have relevant correlates in people. The cytologic features and biological behavior of similar lesions are compared, and selected mechanisms of disease and ancillary diagnostics are reviewed when appropriate. Supporting figures illustrate a subset of lesions. While not an exhaustive archive of veterinary cytology, the goal is to give cytopathologists working in human medicine a general impression of correlates and unique entities in veterinary practice.

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%\u201330% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin. The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper use of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available are crucial. Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that do not require antibiotic therapy.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cots, Josep M.; Al\u00F3s, Juan-Ignacio; B\u00E1rcena, Mario; Boleda, Xavier; Ca\u00F1ada, Jos\u00E9 L.; G\u00F3mez, Niceto; Mendoza, Ana; Vilaseca, Isabel; Llor, Carles","journal":"Acta Otorrinolaringologica (English Edition)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6111694fc4a96cb39fbd1363e793100372e134a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173573515000423; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173573515000423","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of pharyngitis","bacterial causes","Abstract Acute pharyngitis","appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis","proper use of antibiotics","antibiotics of choice","suspected bacterial aetiology","overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis","management algorithms","Penicillin","initial treatment of acute infection","unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics","local suppurative","use of predictive clinical rules","Streptococcus pyogenes","rapid tests","patients allergic","Viral aetiology","association of amoxicillin","line therapy","antibiotic therapy","clinical assessment scales","non-suppurative complications","common infectious diseases","\u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus","rapid antigen detection test","contagious time span","clinicians","main agent","general practitioners\u2019 consultations","symptom resolution","scientific evidence available","diagnostic process","adults","cases","clavulanate","GABHS","macrolides","broad spectrum","techniques","aim","episodes"],"language":"en"},

The closterovirus group combines several positive-strand RNA viruses with very flexuous filamentous particles, of which beet yellows virus (BYV) is the type virus. Closteroviruses are distinct from other RNA viruses of plants in some important phenomenological aspects. They have genomes of up to 20 kilobases (kb), a value comparable only to those of the animal coronaviruses and toroviruses, which have the largest RNA genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses. The existence of such genomes having a coding capacity several times that of an average RNA virus genome raises questions as to the trend whereby the long genomes have evolved and the possible novel functions they have acquired. The dramatic increase in the closterovirus genome coding capacity may be linked to the distinct ecological niche they occupy. Thus, closteroviruses are the only elongated plant viruses known so far to cause phloem-limited infections in plants and to persist in their insect vectors for many hours, in contrast to only minutes.","publish_time":"1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agranovsky, A.

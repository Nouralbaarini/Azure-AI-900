They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged [\u2265]80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections. However, there is a hidden risk of a significant increase in the total fatalities (by up to 200%) in case schools reopen with insufficient containment measures in place.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balabdaoui, F.; Mohr, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ce30909dd1b3075df3ff733c1f5c0dcb89c5d53.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095059v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Compartmental"],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["model-based analysis","number of infected","epidemic models","infected individual","age-dependent progression of COVID","discrete compartment model","Compartmental models","R type of models","corresponding age-distributions","important basis","case schools","associated COVID","low risk","deceased individuals","hidden risk","computational case studies","outbreak","non-pharmaceutical interventions","alternative","transmission dynamics","significant increase","soft lockdown","insufficient containment measures","differential equation","modern health care system","average infection fatality ratio","different scenarios","SARS-CoV","hospitals","day-by-day advancement","overall histories","main stages","research","total fatalities","place","coronavirus","respiratory disease","policy makers","Switzerland","pronounced maximum","wave of infections","predictions","population","years"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the impact of unhealthy lifestyles including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake. We conducted the first large scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for COVID19. Methods: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID19. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4, SD 8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006 to 2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Results: There were 760 COVID19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID19. We also found a dose dependent increase in risk of COVID19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had four fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52, 7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID19. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID19 hospital admission, accounting for up to half of severe cases. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hamer, M.; Kivimaki, M.; Gale, C. R.; Batty, G.

We use (a) the stable cumulative infection of various countries and (b) the number of infection versus the tests carried out to evaluate the model. The time-dependent infection rate is set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in India, various Indian states, and other countries. India imposed an early lockdown to contain the infection that can be treated by its healthcare system. We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in India would be maximum at the end of June or beginning of July 2020. With proper containment measures in the infected zones and social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August. If the containment measures are relaxed before the arrival of the peak infection, more people from the susceptible population will fall sick as the infection is expected to see a three-fold rise at the peak. If the relaxation is given a month after the peak infection, a second peak with a moderate infection will follow. However, a gradual relaxation applied well ahead of peak infection, leads to a two-fold increase in the peak infection. The projection of the model is highly sensitive to the choice of the parameters and the available data. Our model provides a semi-quantitative overview of the progression of COVID-19 in India, with model projections reasonably replicating the current progress. However, since the pandemic is an ongoing dynamic phenomenon, the reported results are subjected to regular updates in consonance with the acquired real data.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatterjee, S.; Sarkar, A.; Karmakar, M.; Paul, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1b8b7bf82f286edf9b1d4170694f6bc4712cd87.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20098681v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRD"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["peak infection","number of infection","moderate infection","current infection rate","total active infection","time-dependent infection rate","model projections","SIRD model","stable cumulative infection of various countries","standard epidemiological model","available data","proper containment measures","real data","progression of COVID","current progress","fold increase","fold rise","gradual relaxation","various Indian states","infected zones","reported results","ongoing dynamic phenomenon","semi-quantitative overview","regular updates","social distancing","consonance","parameters","susceptible population","choice","best fit","people","arrival","pandemic","probable features","early lockdown","tests","month","healthcare system","world"],"language":"en"},

Case report This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient\u2019s HScore2 was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues\u20193 comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with Covid-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. Results The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24 hours. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48 hours, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11 days feeling fit and well. Conclusion This case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in Covid-19. It also raises the question \u2013 is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with Covid-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with Covid-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness4, 5, however patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10-14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events. We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in Covid-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haigh, Kathryn; Syrimi, Zoe Joanna; Irvine, Sharon; Blanchard, Tom J.; Pervaiz, Muhammad Sajid; Toth, Arpad G.; Ratcliffe, Libuse","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe1b01276a66e4cf08cfec0732d9b45a5c2c3d43.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590170220300200; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590170220300200?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Covid","Anakinra","infection","viral load of patients","treatment option","disease course","Case","hours","days","potential risk of cytokine storm","risk factors","year-old male","sore throat","high ferritin","throat swab","coronavirus disease","probability of HLH","potential harm of corticosteroid use","day course of intravenous immunoglobulin","triglyceride","pancytopaenia","comments","haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","gross cervical lymphadenopathy","blood tests","SARS-CoV","receptor antagonist drug","selective IL","cough","secondary","Abstract Background","scientific community","palpable splenomegaly","d-dimer levels","anorexia","colleagues\u2019","deterioration","importance of hyperinflammation syndromes","severe pneumonitis","examination","Nose","pancytopaenic","Russell","immunological phenomenon","early stages of illness4","lymph nodes","spleen","question","Conclusion","experience","adverse events","time","apyrexial","patient\u2019s HScore2","oxygen requirement","described1"],"language":"en"},

A human-to-human transmission was immediately assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was suddenly described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European Country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries. It has recently been shown that 2019-nCov utilizes host receptors namely angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for interindividual disease susceptibility and/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined around 7000 exomes from 5 different Centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three missense changes, p.Asn720Asp, p.Lys26Arg, p.Gly211Arg (MAF 0.002 to 0.015), which have never been reported in the Eastern Asia population, were predicted to interfere with protein cleavage and stabilization. Rare truncating variants likely interfering with the internalization process and one missense variant, p.Trp69Cys, predicted to interfere with 2019-nCov spike protein binding were also observed. These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed inter-individual clinical variability associated with COVID-19. They allow an evidence-based risk assessment opening up the way to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Renieri, A.; Benetti, E.; Tita, R.; Spiga, O.; Ciolfi, A.; Birolo, G.; Bruselles, A.; Doddato, G.; Giliberti, A.; Marconi, C.; Musacchia, F.; Pippucci, T.; Torella, A.; Trezza, A.; Valentino, F.; Baldassarri, M.; Brusco, A.; Asselta, R.; Mirella, B.; Furini, S.; Seri, M.; Nigro, V.; Matullo, G.; Tartaglia, M.; Mari, F.; Pinto, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82666752849e336b6aa956f147c69e4ac9f6b11b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.03.20047977v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern Asia"],"keyphrases":["ACE2 variants","nCov spike protein binding","host proteases","unexpected clinical severity","host receptors","predisposing genetic background","number of variants","COVID","protein stability","protein cleavage","termed coronavirus disease","Rare truncating variants","internalization process","missense variant","missense changes","novel coronavirus","human transmission","observed inter-individual clinical variability","cell surface binding","interindividual disease susceptibility","initial cluster of unexpected interstitial bilateral pneumonia","endemic wave","way","Wuhan","comparison","reason","Lys26Arg","Asn720Asp","potential impact","angiotensin","enzyme","European Country","Asian countries","Network of Italian Genomes","preventive measures","unrecognized entity","different Centers","Gly211Arg","evidence-based risk assessment","therapeutic options","Hubei province","Italy","advantage","NIG","MAF","Trp69Cys","findings","Eastern Asia population","exomes","stabilization","world","infection"],"language":"en"},

We identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic immune response relative to other respiratory viruses.

Countries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second-line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID-19 wave. Method. We propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Results. In general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths. Discussion. Our results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID-19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soubeyrand, Samuel; Ribaud, Melina; Baudrot, Virgile; Allard, Denis; Pommeret, Denys; Roques, Lionel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/115b1d7873b3f7561e49ae05cb8684dfb77f1c99.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069179v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering"],"locations":["Austria","Denmark","Germany","Ireland","Portugal","Romania","Sweden","Netherlands","China","Switzerland","Spain","Belgium","France","United Kingdom","Europe"],"keyphrases":["time countries","line European countries","front-line countries","terms of COVID","current COVID","terms of mortality","wave","data-driven approach","induced mortality","forecasting approach","mild mortality curves","Belgium","Spain","France","Switzerland","United Kingdom","Italy","given focal country","country scale","future","mixture model","predictors","Objective","Results","health systems","Systems Science","Hubei province","number of deaths","hundreds of deaths","decision making","Denmark","Johns Hopkins University Center","Poland","Ireland","factors","Germany","Austria","Netherlands","population structures","various trajectories","Portugal","Romania","Sweden","respect","Differences","moderate death rate","Engineering","performance","dynamics","severe ones","China","continuation","different strategies","methodological viewpoint","manuscript","components","days","analysis","outbreak","Discussion"],"language":"en"},

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. Results: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizumoto, Kenji; Kagaya, Katsushi; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFR"],"locations":["China","Wuhan City"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan City","CrI","China","estimates of transmissibility","virulence of COVID","available data","novel coronavirus","coronavirus disease","available epidemiological datasets","key epidemiological parameters","epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees","posterior estimates of basic reproduction number","multiple data sources","IFR","transmission potential","transmission patterns","total number of infections","underlying transmission dynamics","proportion of infected individuals","crude CFR","multiple introductions","statistical methods","cumulative infections","cluster of cases","declined R","emerging disease","orders of magnitude smaller","ecological modelling approach","recent crude infection fatality ratio","partial observations","quantified uncertainty","board government-chartered flights","deaths","scientists","daily series of laboratory","countries","territories","substantial fraction","time-delay","symptoms","world","Conclusions","ability","epidemic","severity","surveillance systems","enhanced public health intervention","purpose","strides","need","reached values","scarcity","Results","areas","evidence","analysis","Background","power","study"],"language":"en"},

We extracted 1) cumulative numbers of confirmed Covid-19 patients in each Japanese prefecture from January to April 2020; 2) populations per 1-km2 inhabitable area in each prefecture in 2020; and 3) meteorological factors at each prefectural capital city from January to April 2020. Meteorological factors included monthly mean air temperature (degree Celsius), wind speed (m/s), sea level air pressure (hPa), relative humidity (%), and percentage of possible sunshine (%); monthly total of sunshine duration (h) and precipitation (mm); and monthly mean daily maximum ultraviolet (UV) index. To adjust for prefectural population density, we defined the incidence of Covid-19 as the cumulative number of Covid-19 patients divided by the population per 100-km2 inhabitable area. Random-effects meta-regression was performed, and its graph depicted Covid-19 incidence (plotted as the logarithm transformed incidence on the y-axis) as a function of a given meteorological factor (plotted on the x-axis). A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative as a function of the mean air temperature (coefficient, -0.127; P = 0.023), the mean sea level air pressure (coefficient, -0.351; P \u003C 0.001), and the mean daily maximum UV index (coefficient, -0.001; P = 0.012) which indicated that Covid-19 incidence decreased significantly as air temperature, air pressure, and UV increased.

PPE-preparedness was defined as the adherence to guidelines, training HCWs, procuring PPE stocks and responding appropriately to a suspected case (transportation and admission to hospital). Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: ICUs in Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India and Philippines with a 24/7 Emergency/Casualty Department, and capable of mechanically ventilating patients for more than 24 hours. Interventions: Questionnaire sent to intensivists in 633 Level II/III ICUs in 6 Asia-Pacific countries by email, WhatsApp and text messaging. Main outcome measures: 263 intensivists responded, of whom 231 were eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68%-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. 97% either conformed to or exceeded WHO recommendations for PPE-practice. 59% employed airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol-generation-procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock-awareness (best in HK/Singapore/NZ). High-flow-nasal-oxygenation and non-invasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7%, 83.3% respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50%, 80% respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. 38% reported not having specialized airway teams.

Conclusions: Most intensivists from six Asia-Pacific countries appeared to be aware of the WHO PPE-guidelines by either conforming to/exceeding the recommendations. Despite this, there were widespread variabilities across ICUs and countries in several domains, particularly related to PPE-training and preparedness. Standardising PPE guidelines may translate to better training, better compliance and policies that improve HCW safety. Adopting low-cost approaches such as buddy-systems should be encouraged. More importantly, better pandemic preparedness and building systems with deeply embedded culture of safety is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of HCWs during such pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajamani, A.; SUBRAMANIAM, A.; Shekar, K.; Haji, J.; Luo, J.; BIHARI, S.; Wong, W.

This work aims to develop valid instruments to evaluate COVID-19 induced anxiety, protective behaviors, and knowledge towards COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between the three constructs. Methods: A total sample of 215 university students were recruited to participate in an online self-administered questionnaire. The e-survey consisted of three instruments: COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS) with 10 items, Protective Behaviors towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) with 14 items, and COVID-19 Related Knowledge Scale (CRKS) with 12 items. Results: Item-total analysis and CFA models indicated that CIAS items no. 1, 2, 5, and 8 should be removed to achieve adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.78) and structural validity. The protective behaviors towards COVID-19 can be estimated from 3 dimensions: Routine Protective Behaviors (RPB), Post-exposure Protective Behaviors (PPB), and Post-exposure Risky Behaviors (PRB). Meanwhile, PBCS showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.85). Although the sample was unbalanced on gender, gender explained 5% of the variance in protective behaviors with females being more inclined to engage in protective behaviors. Structural Equation Model (SEM) implied that an individual\u0027s COVID-19 related knowledge was associated with the three dimensions of protective behaviors (RPB, PPB, and PRB) positively. However, the level of COVID-19 induced anxiety was linked to RPB and PPB positively but negatively to PRB. Conclusion: The 6-item version of CIAS and the 14-item version of PBCS are promising tools for measuring COVID-19 induced anxiety and protective behaviors and can be adopted for future use during early phases of communicable diseases outbreaks. Knowledge is a key indicator for protective behavior; therefore, awareness strategies need to suppress infodemic impact. Severe stress must be monitored during early phases of outbreaks as it significantly increases the probability of risk behavior engagement.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riad, A.; Huang, Y.; Zheng, L.; Elavsky, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/147a65f218db3796f5a640da3590d75cdfbfb8b3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20050419v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFA","Routine Protective Behaviors","Protective Behaviors","PBCS","Structural Equation Model","RPB","PPB","CIAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dimensions of protective behaviors","Routine Protective Behaviors","Post-exposure Protective Behaviors","individual\u0027s COVID","level of COVID","protective behavioral changes","Induced Anxiety Scale","Post-exposure Risky Behaviors","CIAS items","RPB","PPB","Related Knowledge Scale","PRB","item version of CIAS","item version of PBCS","community anxiety levels","Cronbach alpha","early phases of communicable diseases outbreaks","Item-total analysis","early phases of outbreaks","total sample","gender","outbreak of communicable diseases","good internal consistency","adequate internal consistency","adjacent awareness","awareness strategies","valid instruments","structural validity","Structural Equation Model","probability of risk behavior engagement","CFA models","promising tools","SEM","future use","females","key indicator","CRKS","variance","emerging epidemic","infodemic impact","university students","Background","Results","Severe stress","e-survey","online self-administered questionnaire","work","Methods","Conclusion","relationship","constructs"],"language":"en"},

Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

A range of intersecting biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors are likely to determine an individual\u0027s susceptibility to COVID-19. These factors vary significantly across counties in the United States, and often reflect the structural inequities in our society. Recognizing this vast inter-county variation in risks will be critical to mounting an adequate response strategy. Using publicly available county-specific data we identified key biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors influencing susceptibility to COVID-19, guided by international experiences and consideration of epidemiological parameters of importance. We created bivariate county-level maps to summarize examples of key relationships across these categories, grouping age and poverty; comorbidities and lack of health insurance; proximity, density and bed capacity; and race and ethnicity, and premature death. We have also made available an interactive online tool that allows public health officials to query risk factors most relevant to their local context. Our data demonstrate significant inter-county variation in key epidemiological risk factors, with a clustering of counties in certain states, which will result in an increased demand on their public health system. While the East and West coast cities are particularly vulnerable owing to their densities (and travel routes), a large number of counties in the Southeastern states have a high proportion of at-risk populations, with high levels of poverty, comorbidities, and premature death at baseline, and low levels of health insurance coverage. The list of variables we have examined is by no means comprehensive, and several of them are interrelated and magnify underlying vulnerabilities. The online tool allows readers to explore additional combinations of risk factors, set categorical thresholds for each covariate, and filter counties above different population thresholds. COVID-19 responses and decision making in the United States remain decentralized. Both the federal and state governments will benefit from recognizing high intra-state, inter-county variation in population risks and response capacity. Many of the factors that are likely to exacerbate the burden of COVID-19 and the demand on healthcare systems are the compounded result of long-standing structural inequalities in US society. Strategies to protect those in the most vulnerable counties will require urgent measures to better support communities\u0027 attempts at social distancing and to accelerate cooperation across jurisdictions to supply personnel and equipment to counties that will experience high demand.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chin, Taylor; Kahn, Rebecca; Li, Ruoran; Chen, Jarvis T.; Krieger, Nancy; Buckee, Caroline O.; Balsari, Satchit; Kiang, Mathew V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60147573e52f2a0215b12534fc3b81e3d06296e8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","East"],"keyphrases":["socioeconomic factors","key epidemiological risk factors","query risk factors","vulnerable counties","United States","high demand","filter counties","clustering of counties","additional combinations of risk factors","significant inter-county variation","vast inter-county variation","Southeastern states","certain states","burden of COVID","high levels of poverty","large number of counties","risk of infection","available county-specific data","public health officials","lack of health insurance","public health system","high intra-state","demographic","low levels of health insurance coverage","comorbidities","population risks","bivariate county-level maps","premature death","response capacity","increased demand","high proportion of at-risk populations","examples of key relationships","different population thresholds","interactive online tool","bed capacity","vulnerable owing","categorical thresholds","state governments","US society","severe disease","structural inequities","individual\u0027s susceptibility","compounded result of long-standing structural inequalities","range of intersecting biological","adequate response strategy","spread of Coronavirus Disease","consideration of epidemiological parameters of importance","better support communities\u0027 attempts","urgent measures","social distancing","race","density","proximity","baseline","West coast cities","categories","ethnicity","covariate","readers","travel routes","international experiences","healthcare systems","jurisdictions","cooperation","densities","personnel","equipment","Americans","decision","local context","mortality","responses","list of variables","means comprehensive","underlying vulnerabilities","Strategies"],"language":"en"},

Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to a high level of uncertainty or even lack of essential data, the standard epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19 and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are used to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00FAnior, Ivair Jos\u00E9 Morais; Polveiro, Richard Costa; Souza, Gabriel Medeiros; Bortolin, Daniel Inserra; Sassaki, Fl\u00E1vio Tetsuo; Lima, Alison Talis Martins","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.040782","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global SARS-CoV","virus subtypes","virus populations","shared polymorphisms","well-defined subtypes","pandemic","confounding effect","robust clustering","traditional clustering methods","typical founder effect","World Health Organization","cistrons","nsp14","nsp13","nsp6","nsp12","nsp4","nsp3","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","nucleocapsid","spike","positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus","substantial guidelines","complexity","accessory","effectiveness of trials","family Coronaviridae","amino acid replacements","COVID","study","early stages","candidate vaccines","phenotypic implications","sequence space","ORF8","number","subdivision","genetic structure","context","approaches","drugs","genes","diversification","century"],"language":"en"},

Because SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells, the fear that ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. Due to different structural structures with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. Although ARBs and ACEi have been shown to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Therefore, to date, the exact impact of bot ARBs and ACEis on COVID-19 infection remains unknown and preliminary results are in favor of a protective role of ACEis and ARBs. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as recommended by several medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexandre, Joachim; Cracowski, Jean-Luc; Richard, Vincent; Bouhanick, B\u00E9atrice","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720300998; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720300998?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARB","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of COVID","infection","ACE2 tissue expression","ACE2 membrane expression","multiplication of COVID","inactivation of angiotensin","concerns","infusion of soluble ACE2","membrane receptor","administration of ARB","membrane-bound enzyme","tissue activity","ACE1","protective role of ACEis","case adjustment","SARS COV2","Summary","inflammatory tissue damage","protective properties","exact impact of bot ARBs","receptor blockers","available evidence","human studies","fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome","favor","experimental animals","target cells","risk","type","preliminary results","different structural structures","carboxypeptidase","hemodynamic situation","fear","cases","hypothesis","inhibitors","medical societies","date","present article","effects"],"language":"en"},

As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Methods: We searched major international and Chinese databases Medicine, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM(China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database)) for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) and MERS(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of the proportion of nosocomial infection patients in the diagnosed patients, occupational distribution of nosocomial infection medical staff and other indicators. Results: We included 40 studies. Among the confirmed patients, the proportions of nosocomial infections were 44.0%, 36.0% and 56.0% for COVID-19, SARS and MERS, respectively. Of the confirmed patients, the medical staff and other hospital-acquired infections accounted for 33.0% and 2.0% of COVID-19 cases, 37.0% and 24.0% of SARS cases, and 19.0% and 36.0% of MERS cases, respectively. Nurses and doctors were the most affected among the infected medical staff. The mean numbers of secondary cases caused by one index patient were 29.3 and 6.3 for SARS and MERS, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of nosocomial infection in patients with COVID-19 was 44%. Patients attending hospitals should take personal protection.

It is suggested that potential acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 from prior exposure may be determined by detecting the presence of circulating IgG antibodies against viral antigens, such as the spike glycoprotein and its receptor binding domain (RBD). Testing our asymptomatic population for evidence of COVID-19 immunity would also offer valuable epidemiologic data to aid health care policies and health care management. Currently, there are over 100 antibody tests that are being used around the world without approval from the FDA or similar regulatory bodies, and they are mostly for rapid and qualitative assessment, with different degrees of error rates. ELISA-based testing for sensitive and rigorous quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can potentially offer mechanistic insights into the COVID-19 disease and aid communities uniquely challenged by limited financial resources and access to commercial testing products. Employing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike protein generated in the laboratory, we devised a quantitative ELISA for the detection of circulating serum antibodies. Serum from twenty SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients were used to detect circulating IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD. Quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to the spike glycoprotein or the RBD in patient samples was not always associated with faster recovery, compared to patients with borderline antibody response to the RBD. One patient who did not develop antibodies to the RBD completely recovered from COVID-19. In surveying 99 healthy donor samples (procured between 2017-February 2020), we detected RBD antibodies in one donor from February 2020 collection with three others exhibiting antibodies to the spike protein but not the RBD. Collectively, our study suggests that more rigorous and quantitative analysis, employing large scale sample sets, is required to determine whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD is associated with protection from COVID-19 disease. It is also conceivable that humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD works in association with adaptive T cell response to determine clinical sequela and severity of COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"McAndrews, K.

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, Yiyue; Tian, Tingzhong; Huang, Suling; Wan, Fangping; Li, Jingxin; Li, Shuya; Yang, Hui; Hong, Lixiang; Wu, Nian; Yuan, Enming; Cheng, Lili; Lei, Yipin; Shu, Hantao; Feng, Xiaolong; Jiang, Ziyuan; Chi, Ying; Guo, Xiling; Cui, Lunbiao; Xiao, Liang; Li, Zeng; Yang, Chunhao; Miao, Zehong; Tang, Haidong; Chen, Ligong; Zeng, Hainian; Zhao, Dan; Zhu, Fengcai; Shen, Xiaokun; Zeng, Jianyang","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.986836","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["past SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV data","protein of SARS","PARP1 inhibitor CVL218","effective drug candidates","potential drug candidates","global spread of SARS","data-driven drug repositioning framework","transcriptome data","data present","treatment of COVID","high concentration of CVL218","effective therapeutics","appealing potential","machine learning","literature","infection","antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors","effective inhibitory activity","potential therapeutic agent","antiviral action","retrospective study","possible model","possible mechanisms","based method","anti-inflammatory effect","CpG-induced IL","obvious cytopathic effect","N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid","production","rats","monkeys","poly-ADP","lung","large-scale knowledge graph","ribose polymerase","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","replication","wet-lab validation","previous evidences","statistical analysis approaches","toxicokinetic evaluation","apparent signs of toxicity","Phase","urgent need","specific coronavirus","prevention immunopathology","pneumonia","silico screening","molecular docking simulation","summary","clinical trial","assays","addition"],"language":"en"},

The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection. Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context. Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease. In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the further course this pandemic can take. The data can be used by the health care agencies, the Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to fight the pandemic. Though the model is preliminary, it can be used at regional level to manage the health care system in the present scenario. The recommendations can be made, and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional levels.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhola, J.; Revathi Venkateswaran, V.; Koul, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c42e5f5e8d926df3dd5008d202bd41b59138a4a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.03.20047175v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["health care agencies","different states","community spread","health care system","Health care facilities","spread of community infection","populated country","fate","world","human infection","countries","pandemic","predictive mathematical model","population size","number of deaths","indicative data","vast size","predictive results","regional levels","number of infected patients","Government Organizations","Planning Commission","Italy","Iran","future projections","socio-economic conditions","suitable arrangements","USA","present scenario","measures","novel Coronavirus pathogen Covid","cause of concern","single uniform policy","paramedical staffs","advisories","course","increase","stone unturned","Wuhan","issues","Indian context","idea","China","continents","administration","paper","awareness","adverse effects","dimensions","fast pace","recommendations","vaccine","breakthrough","transmission","Scientists","disease"],"language":"en"},

However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children\u0027s activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and leaving the home. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some parents disagreed due to perceived low risk of infection and practical issues regarding childcare and financial impact. Conclusions Evidence suggests that many children continue to leave the house and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact. This review of behaviour during unplanned school closures could be used to improve infectious disease modelling.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brooks, Samantha; Smith, Louise; Webster, Rebecca; Weston, Dale; Woodland, Lisa; Hall, Ian; Rubin, James","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe21451685572ce2eeb9fdbbedadb4f62c73cf4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037457","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unplanned school closures","Background Emergency school closures","home","predictive of children","infection status","mixed evidence","social contacts","spread of infection","Conclusions Evidence","review of behaviour","public health recommendations","public health interventions","infectious disease outbreaks","infectious disease modelling","parental disagreement","perceived low risk of infection","Parental agreement","existing literature","children\u0027s activities","relevant literature","practical issues","older child age","attempt","parents","financial impact","inception","relationship","measures","non-household members","Methods","databases","Objectives","studies","Main findings","Results","citations"],"language":"en"},

This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p \u003C 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p \u003C 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p = 0.011). We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%, respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%.

To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baldea, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/990508c49e8a8d0cdb7f2925d83d7d28d22b9cc0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20093310v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population","inter-group infections","inter-group interactions","noninteracting groups","network of groups","intra-group interaction unchanged yields","proposed approach","social life","practical approach","social consequences","harvest work","stretched epidemiologic curve","total lockdwon strategy","maximum number of daily infections","different levels","big logistic units","concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy","large productive networks","factories","enterprises","schools","large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity","economic ruin","warehouses","fight","effort of substantial flattening","SARS-CoV","bearable level","importance","COVID","time","study","pandemic dynamics","virus","distancing","limiting case","intermingling","results"],"language":"en"},

Aim To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries. Design Cross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020. Setting Sixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results Seven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting. Conclusion The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costantini, M.; Sleeman, K.

Here we detail how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles can be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crawford, Katharine H.D.; Eguia, Rachel; Dingens, Adam S.; Loes, Andrea N.; Malone, Keara D.; Wolf, Caitlin R.; Chu, Helen Y.; Tortorici, M.

As an urgent public health crisis, it has severe physical and psychological impacts on human. The related experience and mental health on individuals and society during the pandemic can be devastating and has lasting impact. Objective To investigate the psychological stress and gender difference responding to the threat of COVID-19 and relevant factors. Methods A cross-sectional population-based study using online questionnaires via a social media software, WeChat, from 20th to 27th Feb, 2020. Psychological stress was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). The relevant factors included demographics, the epidemic and living status characteristics related to COVID-19, psychological status, the needs of psychological support services, and psychological resilience. Psychological responses to depression, anxiety were also measured. Results Total 3088 questionnaires from 32 provinces in China were collected online. The average score of psychological stress was 3.4. The risk factors related to psychological stress included: female, [\u2264]45 years old, higher education, farmer/worker/clerical and business/service, unemployed, more diseases, uncertainty local epidemic status, close contact or completed a medical observation, higher desire for knowledge about the COVID-19, the diseases, psychological, economic difficulties during the epidemic. The protect factors included: frequently contacting with colleagues, calm mood, and high psychological resilience. There were gender differences on stress, the adaption to current living/working status, the coping strategy for heating, and the psychological support service needs. Conclusion The stress, anxiety and depression were mainly related to gender, age, education, and occupation during the epidemic of COVID-19. It suggested that we should make appropriate control measures and provide different psychological supports according to different population characteristics.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, K.; Li, T.; Luo, D.; Hou, F.; Bi, F.; Stratton, T.

This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavezzo, Enrico; Franchin, Elisa; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Barzon, Luisa; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Rossi, Lucia; Manganelli, Riccardo; Loregian, Arianna; Navarin, Nicol\u00F2; Abate, Davide; Sciro, Manuela; Merigliano, Stefano; Decanale, Ettore; Vanuzzo, Maria Cristina; Saluzzo, Francesca; Onelia, Francesco; Pacenti, Monia; Parisi, Saverio; Carretta, Giovanni; Donato, Daniele; Flor, Luciano; Cocchio, Silvia; Masi, Giulia; Sperduti, Alessandro; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Salvador, Renato; Gaythorpe, Katy A.M.; Brazzale, Alessandra R; Toppo, Stefano; Trevisan, Marta; Baldo, Vincenzo; Donnelly, Christl A.; Ferguson, Neil M.; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Crisanti, Andrea","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Whitney"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Padua"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic infections","frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV","confirmed SARS-CoV","new infections","emergence of SARS","presence of SARS","town lockdown","prevalence of infection","new insights","duration of viral load detectability","municipality of Vo","days","transmission dynamics","study sheds new light","population of Vo","infected cases","small town","confidence interval","Contact tracing","transmission chain reconstruction","consecutive time points","mean serial interval","cycle threshold data","efficacy","network","genome equivalents","Exact Wilcoxon-Mann","clinical presentation","hospitalization","Chinese city of Wuhan","demography","RdRp genes","Hubei province","Whitney test","Padua","Italy","p-values","pneumonia","implemented control measures","death","information","regional authorities","significant difference","nasopharyngeal swabs","community","infectivity","response","COVID","resident","surveys","household","end"],"language":"en"},

The RNA extraction is a major bottleneck in current COVID-19 testing, in terms of turn-around, logistics, component availability and cost, which delays or completely precludes COVID-19 diagnostics in many settings. Efforts to simplify the current methods are important, as increased diagnostic availability and efficiency is expected to benefit patient care and infection control. Here, we describe methods to circumvent RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-qPCR directly on heat-inactivated subject samples as well as samples lysed with readily available detergents. Our data, including cross-comparisons with clinically diagnosed patient samples, suggest that direct RT-qPCR is a viable option to extraction-based COVID-19 diagnostics. We argue that significant savings in terms of time and cost can be achieved by embracing RNA-extraction-free protocols, that feeds directly into the established PCR-based testing pipeline.

High mobility between areas contribute to the importation of cases, affecting the spread of the disease. While many factors influence local incidence and making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can give rise to autonomous outbreaks that impact separate areas of the contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost local incidence and size, making control and tracing measures less effective. In Spain, the high heterogeneity in incidence between similar areas despite the uniform mobility control measures taken suggests that multi-seeding could have played an important role in shaping the spreading of the disease. In this work, we focus on the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 among the $52$ Spanish provinces, showing that local incidence strongly correlates with mobility occurred in the early-stage weeks from and to Madrid, the main mobility hub and where the initial local outbreak unfolded. These results clarify the higher order effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight the relevance of its control.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazzoli, M.; Mateo, D.; Hernando, A.; Meloni, S.; Ramasco, J.

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n=30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56\u002B/-0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47\u002B/-0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82\u002B/-2.95 days. We assume that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific and the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different communities, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n=50 states, we adopted the latent and infectious periods from China, and found a contact period of 3.38\u002B/-0.69 days. Our network model predicts that - without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today - the United states would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.3\u002B/-0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lock down, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peirlinck, Mathias; Sahli Costabal, Francisco; Linka, Kevin; Kuhl, Ellen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1edab37b21f38120b9933f7205803befab9debf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055863","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["United States","China"],"keyphrases":["United States","latent period","contact period","days","outbreak dynamics of COVID","China","global network model","successful outbreak control","disease-specific","global pandemic","infectious periods","place","coronavirus disease","massive political mitigation strategies","effect of mitigation strategies","global economy","population","local epidemic SEIR model","effect of relaxing political measures","behavior-specific","health system","massive amounts of data","World Health Organization","total lock","travel restrictions","shelter","decision guidelines","low-risk subgroups","unprecedented collective effort","potential of vaccination","different communities","mathematical modeling","transmissibility","provinces","long-term impact","valuable tool","basic reproduction number","countries","precise timeline","early stages","results","nationwide peak","infections"],"language":"en"},

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can overcome some of these problems but has limited application in the detection of low-copy-number pathogens in complex samples. Targeted genome capture (TGC) utilizes oligonucleotide probes to enrich specific nucleic acids in heterogeneous extracts and can therefore increase the proportion of NGS reads for low-abundance targets. While earlier studies have demonstrated the utility of this technology for detection of novel pathogens in human clinical samples, the capacity and practicality of TGC-NGS in a veterinary diagnostic setting have not yet been evaluated. Here we report the use of TGC-NGS assays for the detection and characterization of diverse feline pathogen taxa. We detected 31 pathogens comprising nine pathogen taxa in 28 felid samples analyzed. This included 20 pathogens detected via traditional PCR and 11 additional pathogens that had not been previously detected in the same samples. Most of the pathogens detected were sequenced at sufficient breadth and depth to confidently classify them at the species or subspecies level. Target nucleic acids were enriched from a low of 58-fold to 56 million-fold relative to host nucleic acids. Despite the promising performance of these assays, a number of pathogens detected by conventional PCR or serology were not isolated by TGC-NGS, suggesting that further validation is required before this technology can be used in lieu of quality-controlled standard assays. We conclude that TGC-NGS offers great potential as a broad multiplex pathogen characterization assay in veterinary diagnostic and research settings.","publish_time":"2017-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Justin S.; Mackie, Ryan S.; Harrison, Thomas; Shariat, Basir; Kind, Trey; Kehl, Timo; L\u00F6chelt, Martin; Boucher, Christina; VandeWoude, Sue","journal":"J Clin Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ced400d9d754e83891f4bc5b6ea39845fe076c92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5442522.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5442522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGC","NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGC-NGS","NGS assays","number of pathogens","additional pathogens","detection of novel pathogens","copy-number pathogens","proportion of NGS","detection of low","practicality of TGC","Traditional diagnostic assays","use of TGC","complex samples","felid samples","standard assays","specific nucleic acids","Target nucleic acids","veterinary diagnostic setting","human clinical samples","traditional PCR","technology","fold","broad multiplex pathogen characterization assay","characterization of diverse feline pathogen taxa","low-abundance targets","conventional PCR","oligonucleotide probes","great potential","capacity","heterogeneous extracts","research settings","Targeted genome capture","utility","sensitivity","serology","sufficient breadth","quality","application","promising performance","subspecies level","earlier studies","depth","generation sequencing","validation","problems"],"language":"en"},

These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.","publish_time":"2017-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffin, Bryan D.; Muthumani, Kar; Warner, Bryce M.; Majer, Anna; Hagan, Mable; Audet, Jonathan; Stein, Derek R.; Ranadheera, Charlene; Racine, Trina; De La Vega, Marc-Antoine; Piret, Jocelyne; Kucas, Stephanie; Tran, Kaylie N.; Frost, Kathy L.; De Graff, Christine; Soule, Geoff; Scharikow, Leanne; Scott, Jennifer; McTavish, Gordon; Smid, Valerie; Park, Young K.; Maslow, Joel N.; Sardesai, Niranjan Y.; Kim, J.

We noted that few novel proteins co-immunoprecipitated with JEV, and discovered that one of these was heat shock protein 90\u03B2 (HSP90\u03B2), which was probed by mass spectrometry with the highest score of 60.3 after questing the monkey and human protein databases. The specific HSP90\u03B2-JEV binding was confirmed by western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions, and this was significantly inhibited by an anti-human HSP90\u03B2 monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. In addition, the results of confocal laser scanning microscopic examination demonstrated that the HSP90\u03B2-JEV binding occurred on the Vero cell surface. Finally, JEV progeny yields determined by plaque assay were also markedly decreased in siRNA-treated Vero cells, particularly at 24 and 36 h post-infection.

Charonia species have large salivary glands (SGs) that are suspected to produce either a venom and/or sulphuric acid which can immobilize their prey and neutralize the intrinsic toxic properties of COTS. To date, there is little information on the types of toxins produced by tritons. In this paper, the predatory behaviour of the C. tritonis is described. Then, the C. tritonis SG, which itself is made up of an anterior lobe (AL) and posterior lobe (PL), was analyzed using an integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approach, to identify putative toxin- and feeding-related proteins. A de novo transcriptome database and in silico protein analysis predicts that ~3800 proteins have features consistent with being secreted. A gland-specific proteomics analysis confirmed the presence of numerous SG-AL and SG-PL proteins, including those with similarity to cysteine-rich venom proteins. Sulfuric acid biosynthesis enzymes were identified, specific to the SG-PL. Our analysis of the C. tritonis SG (AL and PL) has provided a deeper insight into the biomolecular toolkit used for predation and feeding by C. tritonis.","publish_time":"2017-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bose, U.; Wang, T.; Zhao, M.; Motti, C.

However, it was also recognized as a primary factor leading to hospital-acquired pulmonary dysfunction, in which pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation had been known to play important roles. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important antioxidant, and possesses anti-inflammatory capacity. In this study, we aimed to study the efficacy of Cu/Zn SOD, administered intravenously during high tidal volume (HTV) ventilation, to prevent impairment of lung function. METHODS: Thirty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: 5 h ventilation with (A) low tidal volume (LTV; 8 mL/kg; n = 10), (B) high tidal volume (HTV; 18 mL/kg; n = 14), or (C) HTV and intravenous treatment of Cu/Zn SOD at a dose of 1000 U/kg/h (HTV \u002B SOD; n = 14). Lung function was evaluated both at baseline and after 5-h ventilation. Lung injury was assessed by histological examination, lung water and protein contents in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Pulmonary oxidative stress was examined by concentrations of methylguanidine (MG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in BALF, and antioxidative activity by protein expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in the lung. Severity of lung inflammation was evaluated by white blood cell and differential count in BALF, and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and mRNA expression of nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) in the lung. We also examined protein expression of surfactant protein (SP)-A and D and we measured hourly changes in serum nitric oxide (NO) level. RESULTS: Five hours of LTV ventilation did not induce a major change in lung function, whereas 5 h of HTV ventilation induced apparent combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorder, together with increased pulmonary oxidative stress, decreased anti-oxidative activity and increased lung inflammation (P \u003C 0.05). HTV ventilation also decreased SP-A and SP-D expression and suppressed serum NO level during the time course of ventilation. Cu/Zn SOD administered intravenously during HTV ventilation effectively reversed associated pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation (P \u003C 0.05); moreover, it preserved SP-A and SP-D expressions in the lung and increased serum nitric oxide (NO) level, enhancing vascular NO bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: HTV ventilation can induce combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorders. Intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD during HTV ventilation can prevent lung function impairment and lung injury via reducing pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation, preserving pulmonary surfactant expression, and enhancing vascular NO bioavailability.","publish_time":"2017-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Nan-Chun; Liao, Fan-Ting; Cheng, Hao-min; Sung, Shih-Hsien; Yang, Yu-Chun; Wang, Jiun-Jr","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ec8feb6b05e22302b3cdd9b3aa4a850db3691e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5530466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5530466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cu/Zn SOD","LTV","HTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lung injury","lung water","increased lung inflammation","h of HTV ventilation","Severity of lung inflammation","impairment of lung function","lung function impairment","h ventilation","obstructive lung disorders","Zn SOD","increased pulmonary oxidative stress","pulmonary surfactant expression","associated pulmonary oxidative stress","hours of LTV ventilation","protein expression of surfactant protein","time course of ventilation","pulmonary dysfunction","Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation","protein expression of glutathione peroxidase","protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase","anti-oxidative activity","protein contents","increased serum nitric oxide","BALF","level","SP-D expressions","efficacy of Cu","intravenous treatment of Cu","Intravenous administration of Cu","high tidal volume","mRNA expression of nuclear factor-\u03BAB","Zn superoxide dismutase","low tidal volume","suppressed serum","primary factor","bioavailability","study","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","antioxidative activity","TNF-\u03B1","NF-\u03BAB","important antioxidant","important roles","iNOS","differential count","white blood cell","histological examination","respiratory failure","patients","intensive care unit","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","oxygenation","ICAM","intercellular adhesion molecule","hourly changes","male Sprague-Dawley rats","major change","matrix metalloproteinase","BACKGROUND","hospital","groups","dose","baseline","concentrations of methylguanidine","METHODS","MMP","anti-inflammatory capacity","malondialdehyde","MDA","GPx","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","operating room"],"language":"en"},

An ontology that expresses the shared concepts and their relationships in a specific field could be used as a semantic framework for social media data analytics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to refine an adolescent depression ontology and terminology as a framework for analyzing social media data and to evaluate description logics between classes and the applicability of this ontology to sentiment analysis. METHODS: The domain and scope of the ontology were defined using competency questions. The concepts constituting the ontology and terminology were collected from clinical practice guidelines, the literature, and social media postings on adolescent depression. Class concepts, their hierarchy, and the relationships among class concepts were defined. An internal structure of the ontology was designed using the entity-attribute-value (EAV) triplet data model, and superclasses of the ontology were aligned with the upper ontology. Description logics between classes were evaluated by mapping concepts extracted from the answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) onto the ontology concepts derived from description logic queries. The applicability of the ontology was validated by examining the representability of 1358 sentiment phrases using the ontology EAV model and conducting sentiment analyses of social media data using ontology class concepts. RESULTS: We developed an adolescent depression ontology that comprised 443 classes and 60 relationships among the classes; the terminology comprised 1682 synonyms of the 443 classes. In the description logics test, no error in relationships between classes was found, and about 89% (55/62) of the concepts cited in the answers to FAQs mapped onto the ontology class. Regarding applicability, the EAV triplet models of the ontology class represented about 91.4% of the sentiment phrases included in the sentiment dictionary. In the sentiment analyses, \u201Cacademic stresses\u201D and \u201Csuicide\u201D contributed negatively to the sentiment of adolescent depression. CONCLUSIONS: The ontology and terminology developed in this study provide a semantic foundation for analyzing social media data on adolescent depression. To be useful in social media data analysis, the ontology, especially the terminology, needs to be updated constantly to reflect rapidly changing terms used by adolescents in social media postings. In addition, more attributes and value sets reflecting depression-related sentiments should be added to the ontology.","publish_time":"2017-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Hyesil; Park, Hyeoun-Ae; Song, Tae-Min","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eddb953f3038ebeb9127268221f065c5cda2a724.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5547245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5547245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ontology concepts","ontology class concepts","adolescent depression ontology","upper ontology","ontology EAV model","sentiment analyses of social media data","social media postings","sentiment of adolescent depression","social media data analysis","social media data analytics","terminology","sentiment phrases","sentiment analysis","mapping concepts","shared concepts","sentiment dictionary","relationships","triplet data model","Social networking services","applicability","description logics test","reflecting depression-related sentiments","value","EAV triplet models","semantic framework","FAQs","study","answers","description logic queries","adolescents","SNS postings","semantic foundation","asked questions","competency questions","SNSs","literature","abundant information","thoughts","error","clinical practice guidelines","interests","feelings","BACKGROUND","attributes","academic stresses","entity-attribute","superclasses","hierarchy","patterns of behavior","changing terms","suicide","domain","scope","specific field","representability","synonyms","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","aim","addition","internal structure","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Gankeshuangqing dispersible tablets (GKSQDT) which have a good effect on treating AURTIs. GKSQDT is composed of baicalin and andrographolide. However, its severe bitterness limits application of patients. Due to the addition of plentiful accessories, common masking methods are unsuitable for GKSQDT. It is thus necessary to develop a new masking method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Previous study showed that baicalin was less bitter than andrographolide. Thus, particle coating technology was adapted to prepare composite particles that baicalin coated on the surface of andrographolide to decrease bitterness. Initially, particle size of baicalin and coating time of composite was investigated to prepare composite. Then, scanning electron microscopy, wettability, and infrared (IR) spectrogram were used to characterize the microstructure of composite. Furthermore, electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment, and human sensory test were applied to evaluate the masking effect. RESULTS: To produce composite, baicalin should be ground in vibromill for 6 min. Then, andrographolide fine powder was added to grind together for 6 min. Contact angle of composite was smaller than mixture, and more similar to baicalin. Other physical characterization including microstructure, wettability, and IR also suggested that andrographolide was successfully coated by baicalin superfine. Furthermore, taste-masking test indicated taste-masked tablets was less bitter than original tablets. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that particle coating technology can be used for taste masking of GKSQDT without adding other substance. Moreover, it provides a new strategy of taste masking for national medicine. SUMMARY: A new strategy to mask bitterness without adding any other substance based on coating technology was provided. The masking effect was confirmed by electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment and human sensory test.

Studies of mutagen-resistant viruses have identified determinants of replicative fidelity and the importance of mutation rate to viral population dynamics. We have previously demonstrated the effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza A virus using three nucleoside analogs as well as the virus\u2019s high genetic barrier to mutagen resistance. Here, we investigate the mutagen-resistant phenotypes of mutations that were enriched in drug-treated populations. We find that PB1 T123A has higher replicative fitness than the wild type, PR8, and maintains its level of genome production during 5-fluorouracil (2,4-dihydroxy-5-fluoropyrimidine) treatment. Surprisingly, this mutagen-resistant variant also has an increased baseline rate of C-to-U and G-to-A mutations. A second drug-selected mutation, PA T97I, interacts epistatically with PB1 T123A to mediate high-level mutagen resistance, predominantly by limiting the inhibitory effect of nucleosides on polymerase activity. Consistent with the importance of epistatic interactions in the influenza virus polymerase, our data suggest that nucleoside analog resistance and replication fidelity are strain dependent. Two previously identified ribavirin {1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide} resistance mutations, PB1 V43I and PB1 D27N, do not confer drug resistance in the PR8 background, and the PR8-PB1 V43I polymerase exhibits a normal baseline mutation rate. Our results highlight the genetic complexity of the influenza A virus polymerase and demonstrate that increased replicative capacity is a mechanism by which an RNA virus can counter the negative effects of elevated mutation rates. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. This standing genetic diversity gives them the potential to adapt rapidly, evolve resistance to antiviral therapeutics, and evade immune responses. Viral mutants with altered mutation rates or mutational tolerance have provided insights into how genetic diversity arises and how it affects the behavior of RNA viruses. To this end, we identified variants within the polymerase complex of influenza virus that are able to tolerate drug-mediated increases in viral mutation rates. We find that drug resistance is highly dependent on interactions among mutations in the polymerase complex. In contrast to other viruses, influenza virus counters the effect of higher mutation rates primarily by maintaining high levels of genome replication. These findings suggest the importance of maintaining large population sizes for viruses with high mutation rates and show that multiple proteins can affect both mutation rate and genome synthesis.","publish_time":"2017-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pauly, Matthew D.; Lyons, Daniel M.; Fitzsimmons, William J.; Lauring, Adam S.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1d77b3376d3cec471e2a316e0d5983b063c8d22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5557677.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5557677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high mutation rates","importance of mutation rate","viral mutation rates","drug resistance","influenza virus polymerase","altered mutation rates","drug-selected mutation","effect of higher mutation rates","polymerase complex of influenza virus","IMPORTANCE RNA viruses","normal baseline mutation rate","resistant viruses","high-level mutagen resistance","PR8-PB1 V43I polymerase","H resistance mutations","nucleoside analog resistance","behavior of RNA viruses","negative effects of elevated mutation rates","PB1 T123A","polymerase activity","mutagen-resistant phenotypes of mutations","PB1 D27N","mutagen-resistant variant","Studies of mutagen","genetic diversity","drug-treated populations","virus\u2019s high genetic barrier","increased baseline rate of C","high levels of genome replication","effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza","genetic complexity","importance of epistatic interactions","drug-mediated increases","higher replicative fitness","mutagenic nucleoside analogs","determinants of replicative fidelity","increased replicative capacity","viral population dynamics","Viral mutants","replication fidelity","PR8 background","genome synthesis","dihydroxy","identified ribavirin","low mutational tolerance","level of genome production","antiviral therapeutics","diverse populations","broad-spectrum antiviral strategy","large population sizes","inhibitory effect of nucleosides","data","PA T97I","multiple proteins","wild type","mechanism","insights","variants","hydroxymethyl","immune responses","fluorouracil","potential","contrast","oxolan","fluoropyrimidine","treatment","results","findings","end"],"language":"en"},

This study compares detection rates, genotype distribution and viral loads of different enteric viral agents in HIV-1 seropositive (n = 200) and HIV-1 seronegative (n = 125) children hospitalized with DD in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Except for group A rotavirus (RVA), which were detected through enzyme immunoassay, the other enteric viruses (norovirus [NoV], astrovirus [HAstV], adenovirus [HAdV] and bocavirus [HBoV]) were detected through PCR or RT-PCR. A quantitative PCR was performed for RVA, NoV, HAstV, HAdV and HBoV.

Although much is known about its bone-restricted gene expression pattern and protein biochemical and topological features, little information is available for BRIL physiological function. Two autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are caused by distinct, but recurrent mutations in the BRIL gene. Yet, the underlying mechanisms by which those mutations lead to OI are still poorly understood. A previous report indicated that BRIL knockout (KO) mice had bone deformities, shortened long bones, and reproductive problems. Here we generated and systematically analyzed the skeletal phenotype of a new global Bril KO/LacZ knockin mouse model. KO mice reproduced and thrived normally up to 12 month of age. The skeletal phenotype of KO and WT littermates was assessed at embryonic (E13.5 to E18.5) and postnatal (2 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 8 months) time-points. Embryos from E13.5 through to E18.5 showed significant X-Gal staining in all skeletal elements without any apparent patterning anomalies. Although bone deformities were never observed at any postnatal ages, minor and transient differences were noted in terms of bone length and static uCT parameters, but not systematically across all ages and genders. These changes, however, were not accompanied by significant alteration in bone material properties as assessed by a 3-point bending test. In addition, no changes were detected in circulating serum markers of bone turnover (P1NP, CTX-I, and osteocalcin). Gene expression monitoring also revealed no major impact of the loss of BRIL. Further, when mice were challenged with a surgically-induced fracture in tibia, bones repaired equally well in the KO mice as compared to WT. Finally, we showed that BRIL C-terminus is not a bona fide binding site for calcium. In conclusion, our in depth analysis suggest that skeletal patterning, bone mass accrual and remodeling in mice proceeded independent of BRIL.","publish_time":"2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patoine, Alexa; Husseini, Abdallah; Kasaai, Bahar; Gaumond, Marie-H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Moffatt, Pierre","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54e56ec5b95cb23c2b682b181bcc66b7fae8aa07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5589259.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5589259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["BRIL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BRIL gene","bone deformities","KO mice","BRIL knockout","independent of BRIL","loss of BRIL","new global Bril KO","skeletal phenotype of KO","bone-restricted IFITM","bone mass accrual","terms of bone length","bone material properties","BRIL physiological function","BRIL C-terminus","bone-restricted gene expression pattern","skeletal patterning","skeletal elements","circulating serum markers of bone turnover","Gene expression monitoring","months","postnatal ages","E18","E13","changes","protein biochemical","long bones","significant alteration","recurrent mutations","apparent patterning anomalies","short transmembrane protein","significant X-Gal staining","little information","topological features","remodeling","LacZ knockin mouse model","transient differences","major impact","WT littermates","P1NP","static uCT parameters","depth analysis","autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta","CTX","weeks","previous report","binding site","induced fracture","tibia","reproductive problems","days","time-points","calcium","conclusion","underlying mechanisms","osteoblasts","bending test","month of age","osteocalcin","addition","genders","Embryos"],"language":"en"},

High\u2010throughput, inexpensive, sensitive sequencing methods and metagenomics now make it possible to study the contribution dsDNA, ssDNA and RNA virus\u2010like particles make to the human virome, and in particular the intestinal virome. AIM: To review and evaluate the pioneering studies that have attempted to characterise the human virome and generated an increased interest in understanding how the intestinal virome might contribute to maintaining health, and the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. METHODS: Relevant virome\u2010related articles were selected for review following extensive language\u2010 and date\u2010unrestricted, electronic searches of the literature. RESULTS: The human intestinal virome is personalised and stable, and dominated by phages. It develops soon after birth in parallel with prokaryotic communities of the microbiota, becoming established during the first few years of life. By infecting specific populations of bacteria, phages can alter microbiota structure by killing host cells or altering their phenotype, enabling phages to contribute to maintaining intestinal homeostasis or microbial imbalance (dysbiosis), and the development of chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases including HIV infection and Crohn\u0027s disease, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our understanding of the intestinal virome is fragmented and requires standardised methods for virus isolation and sequencing to provide a more complete picture of the virome, which is key to explaining the basis of virome\u2010disease associations, and how enteric viruses can contribute to disease aetiologies and be rationalised as targets for interventions.","publish_time":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carding, S.

A significant rearrangement of host cell vimentin around Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuoles is observed during the course of infection. ROP18 (TgROP18) is a serine-threonine kinase secreted by T. gondii rhoptry and a major virulence factor; however, the mechanisms by which this kinase modulates host factors remain poorly understood. Different and dynamic patterns of vimentin solubility, phosphorylation, and expression levels were observed in host cells infected with T. gondii strain RH and RH \u0394rop18 strains, suggesting that TgROP18 contributes to the regulation of these dynamic patterns. Additionally, host cell vimentin was demonstrated to interact with and be phosphorylated by TgROP18. A significant increase in T. gondii infection rate was observed in vimentin knockout human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC), while vimentin knockout or knock down in host cells had no impact on parasite proliferation and egress. These results indicate that host cell vimentin can inhibit T. gondii invasion. Interestingly, western blotting of different mouse tissues indicated that the lowest vimentin expression level was present in the brain, which may explain the mechanism underlying the nervous system tropism of T. gondii, and the phenomenon of huge cyst burdens developing in the mouse brain during chronic infection.","publish_time":"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Cheng; Kong, Ling; Zhou, Lijuan; Xia, Jing; Wei, Haixia; Liu, Min; Peng, Hongjuan","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c39d9aa9e05723ab781cc800c89c69869fd0eeb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8d487139eb8085addba9850f90597f206531f3c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5666328.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cells","Toxoplasma gondii","significant rearrangement of host cell vimentin","host factors","gondii infection rate","gondii rhoptry","gondii invasion","gondii strain RH","dynamic patterns of vimentin solubility","TgROP18","lowest vimentin expression level","vimentin knockout human brain microvessel endothelial cells","mouse brain","course of infection","chronic infection","expression levels","parasite proliferation","significant increase","western blotting of different mouse tissues","RH \u0394rop18 strains","Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuoles","obligate intracellular parasite","serine-threonine kinase","HBMEC","phosphorylation","impact","phenomenon of huge cyst burdens","major virulence factor","nervous system tropism","mechanisms","cytoskeleton","egress","regulation","results"],"language":"en"},

Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013\u20132015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2\u20133 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83% tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71% tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. However, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.","publish_time":"2017-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogers, Kimberly B.; Roohi, Shahrokh; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Montgomery, David; Parker, Jayme; Fowler, Nisha H.; Xu, Xiyan; Ingram, Deandra J.; Fearey, Donna; Williams, Steve M.; Tarling, Grant; Brown, Clive M.; Cohen, Nicole J.","journal":"Journal of Travel Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c10a6b69d0d10ca1d524a7af135a5405a5a65a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5684694.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-pdf/24/6/tax069/21576761/tax069.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","ARI"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["influenza prevention","Influenza outbreaks","Laboratory-based influenza surveillance","inland influenza surveillance","drifted influenza virus strains","cruise ships","influenza vaccination status","passengers","predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains","southern hemisphere influenza vaccines","cruise lines","nasopharyngeal specimens","subset of specimens positive","respiratory viruses","Alaska summertime cruise season","B virus","nasopharyngeal swab specimens","public health surveillance project","Alaska State Virology Laboratory","Cruise ship medical staff","control activities","Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens","acute respiratory illness","Alaska Division of Public Health","high yield of positive results","operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs","ill crew members","Disease Control","crews","CDC","ARI","voyage","ship infirmary","Ill travellers","Onset dates of illness relative","recent travel history","introduction of novel","age groups","Centers","ASVL","week","date of boarding","potential source","costs","United States","years","METHODS","days","CONCLUSIONS","need","cruises","BACKGROUND","benefits"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to validate currently available antibodies to chicken IFN-\u03B3 using transfected CHO cells. Moreover, this ICS assay was evaluated for use to detect mitogen and antigen induced IFN-\u03B3 production in chicken peripheral blood leucocytes. Chickens from an inbred white leghorn line containing two MHC haplotypes, B19 and B21, were divided into three experimental groups; one group was kept as naive controls, one group was vaccinated intramuscularly twice with a commercial inactivated ND virus (NDV) vaccine, and the last group was vaccinated orally twice with a commercial live attenuated NDV vaccine. PBMC were ex vivo stimulated with ConA or with NDV antigen. The ICS assay was used to determine the phenotype and frequency of IFN-\u03B3 positive cells. ConA stimulation induced extensive IFN-\u03B3 production in both CD3(\u002B)TCR\u03B3\u03B4(\u002B) (\u03B3\u03B4 T cells) cells and CD3(\u002B)TCR\u03B3\u03B4(\u2212) cells (\u03B1\u03B2 T cells), but no significant differences were observed between the experimental groups. Furthermore, a large proportion of the IFN-\u03B3 producing cells were CD3(\u2212) indicating that other cells than classic T cells, secreted this cytokine. NDV antigen stimulation induced IFN-\u03B3 production but to a lower extent than ConA and with a large variation between individuals. The CD3(\u002B)TCR1\u03B3\u03B4(\u2212)CD8\u03B1(\u002B) (CTL) population produced the highest NDV specific IFN-\u03B3 responses, with significantly elevated levels of IFN-\u03B3 producing cells in the B19 chickens vaccinated orally with live attenuated NDV vaccine.

Egr-1 (Early Growth Response Factor-1) is one such cellular transcription factor, which gets phosphorylated during the lytic phase of viral life cycle to perpetrate its function. This study demonstrates the mechanism of how Egr-1 mediates transcription of the immediate early gene, RTA (Replication and transcription activator), which is the lytic switch gene of KSHV. Egr-1 depleted KSHV infected cells exhibited reduced expression of RTA. Also, an increase in Egr-1 phosphorylation led to a higher virion production, which was suppressed in the presence of p38 and Raf inhibitors. Reporter assays showed that coexpression of Egr-1 and CBP (CREB-binding protein) enhances RTA promoter activity as compared to the expression of either Egr-1 or CBP alone. Binding of Egr-1 and CBP at RTA promoter was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), which showed an enhanced accumulation during viral reactivation. Mutation in Egr-1 binding site of the RTA promoter eliminated Egr-1 response on promoter activation. Furthermore, de novo infection of THP-1 (monocytic) and HUVECs (endothelial) cells showed an upregulation of Egr-1 phosphorylation, whereas depletion of Egr-1 reduced the mRNA levels of RTA during primary infection. Together, these results demonstrate a cooperative role of Egr-1 and CBP in mediating RTA transcription, which significantly improves our understanding of the involvement of cellular factors controlling RTA transcription in KSHV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkar, Roni; Verma, Subhash C.","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2efb2e64e0fb3039c9fd9bd5abbebaf9d48ed216.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5710935.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RTA","KSHV","CBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Binding of Egr","coexpression of Egr","upregulation of Egr","depletion of Egr","mediating RTA transcription","cooperative role of Egr","RTA promoter activity","reduced expression of RTA","CBP","cellular transcription factor","mRNA levels of RTA","transcription activator","KSHV pathogenesis","lytic switch gene of KSHV","promoter activation","lytic reactivation","persistent infection","primary infection","course of infection","depleted KSHV infected cells","involvement of cellular factors","binding site","phosphorylation","host cellular environment","viral reactivation","novo infection of THP","lytic phase of viral life cycle","Early Growth Response Factor","CREB-binding protein","immediate early gene","Replication","chromatin immunoprecipitation assay","ChIP","monocytic","herpesvirus","understanding","enhanced accumulation","presence of p38","Raf inhibitors","higher virion production","HUVECs","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma","function","Reporter assays","results","pathways","Mutation","study","mechanism","increase"],"language":"en"},

In addition to Th1/Th2 cells, whose role in IBD has been previously well defined, recent evidence indicates that Th17 cells and Tregs also play a crucial role in the development of IBD. Diets which contain excess sugars, salt, and fat may also be important actors in the pathogenesis of IBD, which may be the cause of high IBD incidence in western developed and industrialized countries. Up until now, the reason for the variance in prevalence of IBD between developed and developing countries has been unknown. This is partly due to the increasing popularity of western diets in developing countries, which makes the data harder to interpret. The enterocrinins glucagon-like peptides (GLPs), including GLP-1 and GLP-2, exhibit notable benefits on lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis formation, plasma glucose levels, and maintenance of gastric mucosa integrity.

Despite a 99% reduction in annual wild poliovirus (WPV) cases since 1988, tackling the last 1% has proven difficult. We identified key covariates of geographical variation in polio transmission patterns by relating country-specific annual disease incidence to demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors. We assessed the relative contributions of these variables to the performance of computer-generated models for predicting polio transmission. We also examined the effect of spatial coupling on the polio extinction frequency in islands relative to larger land masses. Access to sanitation, population density, forest cover and routine vaccination coverage were the strongest predictors of polio incidence, however their relative effect sizes were inconsistent geographically. The effect of climate variables on polio incidence was negligible, indicating that a climate effect is not identifiable at the annual scale, suggesting a role for climate in shaping the transmission seasonality rather than intensity. We found polio fadeout frequency to depend on both population size and demography, which should therefore be considered in policies aimed at extinction. Our comparative epidemiological approach highlights the heterogeneity among polio transmission determinants.

Prediction of drug-induced dysfunction onset is difficult and is still largely based on detection of cardiac troponin (cTn), a circulating marker of heart damage. In the last years, several investigations focused on the possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DOX-induced toxicity in vitro, with contrasting results. Recently, several groups employed animal models to mimic patient\u2019s condition, investigate the biological pathways perturbed by DOX, and identify diagnostic markers of cardiotoxicity. We reviewed the results from several studies investigating cardiac miRNAs expression in rodent models of DOX-treatment. We also discussed the data from two publications indicating the possible use of circulating miRNA as biomarkers of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Unfortunately, limited information was derived from these studies, as selection methods of candidate-miRNAs and heterogeneity in cardiotoxicity assessment greatly hampered the novelty and robustness of the findings. Nevertheless, at least one circulating miRNA, miR-1, showed a good potential as early biomarker of drug-mediated cardiac dysfunction onset. The use of animal models to investigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity surely helps narrowing the gap between basic research and clinical practice. Despite this, several issues, including selection of relevant miRNAs and less-than-optimal assessment of cardiotoxicity, greatly limited the results obtained so far. Nonetheless, the association of patients-based studies with the use of preclinical models may be the key to address the many unanswered questions regarding the pathophysiology and early detection of cardiotoxicity.","publish_time":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruggeri, Clarissa; Gioffr\u00E9, Sonia; Achilli, Felice; Colombo, Gualtiero I.; D\u2019Alessandra, Yuri","journal":"Heart Fail Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/778e39cb165c72b4245262781d804c4e1f6da3d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5756562.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced cardiotoxicity","cardiotoxicity assessment","early detection of cardiotoxicity","optimal assessment of cardiotoxicity","use of animal models","diagnostic markers of cardiotoxicity","cardiac miRNAs expression","use of preclinical models","induced dysfunction onset","rodent models","based studies","possible use of circulating miRNA","induced toxicity","selection of relevant miRNAs","cardiac dysfunction onset","detection of cardiac troponin","contrasting results","early biomarker of drug","Prediction of drug","circulating marker of heart damage","limited information","selection methods of candidate","possible involvement of microRNAs","gap","biomarkers","patient\u2019s condition","cTn","pathophysiology","heterogeneity","unanswered questions","good potential","basic research","clinical practice","key","novelty","publications","association of patients","biological pathways","robustness","investigations","issues","groups","effect of doxorubicin","phenomenon","findings","data","treatment","mechanisms","years"],"language":"en"},

Severe disease following H5N1 influenza infection is often associated with dysregulated host innate immune response also known as cytokine storm but the virological and cellular basis of these responses has not been clearly described. We rescued a series of 6:2 reassortant viruses that combined a PR8 HA/NA pairing with the internal gene segments from human adapted H1N1, H3N2, or avian H5N1 viruses and found that mice infected with the virus with H5N1 internal genes suffered severe weight loss associated with increased lung cytokines but not high viral load. This phenotype did not map to the NS gene segment, and NS1 protein of H5N1 virus functioned as a type I IFN antagonist as efficient as NS1 of H1N1 or H3N2 viruses. Instead we discovered that the internal genes of H5N1 virus supported a much higher level of replication of viral RNAs in myeloid cells in vitro, but not in epithelial cells and that this was associated with high induction of type I IFN in myeloid cells. We also found that in vivo during H5N1 recombinant virus infection cells of haematopoetic origin were infected and produced type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together our data infer that human and avian influenza viruses are differently controlled by host factors in alternative cell types; internal gene segments of avian H5N1 virus uniquely drove high viral replication in myeloid cells, which triggered an excessive cytokine production, resulting in severe immunopathology.","publish_time":"2018-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Bradley, Konrad C.; Long, Jason S.; Frise, Rebecca; Ashcroft, Jonathan W.; Hartgroves, Lorian C.; Shelton, Holly; Makris, Spyridon; Johansson, Cecilia; Cao, Bin; Barclay, Wendy S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5771632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H5N1 influenza virus","avian H5N1 viruses","internal genes of H5N1 virus","H5N1 influenza infection","H5N1 internal genes","internal gene segments of avian H5N1 virus","NS1 protein of H5N1 virus","avian influenza viruses","myeloid cells","H5N1 recombinant virus infection cells of haematopoetic origin","high viral replication","pathogenic avian influenza","H3N2 viruses","epithelial cells","high viral load","high induction of type","reassortant viruses","NS1 of H1N1","produced type","viral RNAs","human adapted H1N1","IFN antagonist","Severe disease","human infections","severe immunopathology","high case fatality rate","severe weight loss","NS gene segment","cytokine storm","host factors","dysregulated host","proinflammatory cytokines","increased lung cytokines","higher level of replication","excessive cytokine production","alternative cell types","NA pairing","HPAI","frequent zoonoses","PR8 HA","immune response","cellular basis","mice","public health concern","decade","responses","data","series","phenotype"],"language":"en"},

In the online connected world possibilities for such communication have grown further, in particular with the opportunity that social media presents. As a consequence, communication strategies have become a key plank of responses to crises ranging from epidemics to terrorism to natural disaster. Such strategies involve a range of innovative practices on social media. Whilst being able to bring about positive effects, they can also bring about a range of harmful unintended side effects. This include economic harms produced by incorrect information and a range of social harms that can be fuelled by myths and rumours, worsening negative phenomena such as stigmatisation and discrimination. Given the potential for such harms, one might expect that affected or potentially affected individuals would be able to challenge such measures before courts or administrative tribunals. As this paper demonstrates however this is not the case. More often than not seemingly applicable legal approaches are unlikely to be able to engage such methods. This is often because such measures represent activities that are purely expressive in nature and therefore not capable of imposing any binding legal or corporeal changes on individuals. Whilst some forms of soft law may pose requirements for public officials involved in such activities (e.g. codes of conduct or of professional ethics), they are not likely to offer potentially harmed individuals the chance to to challenge particular communication strategies before courts or legal tribunals. The result is that public authorities largely have a free reign to communicate how they wish and do not have to have to comply with a range of requirements (e.g. relating to form and substantive) content) that would in general apply to most forms of official administrative act.","publish_time":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quinn, Paul","journal":"Life Sci Soc Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ec34d986fab1e312e058a47ab41341ee9297dfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5799154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["range of social harms","particular communication strategies","range of requirements","public authorities","legal tribunals","social media","affected individuals","courts","public officials","range of innovative practices","activities","harmed individuals","administrative tribunals","range of harmful unintended","measures","economic harms","applicable legal approaches","crisis situation","forms of official administrative act","positive effects","forms of soft law","incorrect information","negative phenomena","epidemics","crises","chance","key plank of responses","terrorism","codes of conduct","myths","online connected world possibilities","corporeal changes","professional ethics","content","natural disaster","stigmatisation","discrimination","rumours","general","nature","free reign","opportunity","life","result","consequence","property","potential","methods","paper","case"],"language":"en"},

SP-D exerts antimicrobial effects and dampens inflammation through direct microbial interactions and modulation of host cell responses via a series of cellular receptors. However, low protein concentrations, genetic variation, biochemical modification, and proteolytic breakdown can induce decomposition of multimeric SP-D into low-molecular weight forms, which may induce pro-inflammatory SP-D signaling. Multimeric SP-D can decompose into trimeric SP-D, and this process, and total SP-D levels, are partly determined by variation within the SP-D gene, SFTPD. SP-D has been implicated in the development of respiratory diseases including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, allergic asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease-induced breakdown or modifications of SP-D facilitate its systemic leakage from the lung, and circulatory SP-D is a promising biomarker for lung injury. Moreover, studies in preclinical animal models have demonstrated that local pulmonary treatment with recombinant SP-D is beneficial in these diseases. In recent years, SP-D has been shown to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in various non-pulmonary organs and to have effects on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory effects in vessel walls, which enhance the risk of atherosclerosis. A common SFTPD polymorphism is associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, and SP-D has been associated with metabolic disorders because of its effects in the endothelium and adipocytes and its obesity-dampening properties. This review summarizes and discusses the reported genetic associations of SP-D with disease and the clinical utility of circulating SP-D for respiratory disease prognosis. Moreover, basic research on the mechanistic links between SP-D and respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases is summarized. Perspectives on the development of SP-D therapy are addressed.","publish_time":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sorensen, Grith L.","journal":"Front Med (Lausanne)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47dffc938eba5dd824d4f715af096791b0d2d04b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5809447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5809447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multimeric"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant SP-D","circulatory SP-D","SP-D gene","trimeric SP-D","pro-inflammatory SP-D","decomposition of multimeric SP-D","D therapy","development of SP","total SP-D levels","modifications of SP","clinical utility of circulating SP-D","Surfactant protein D","reported genetic associations of SP","antimicrobial effects","anti-inflammatory effects","pro-inflammatory effects","respiratory disease prognosis","development of respiratory diseases","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","metabolic diseases","local pulmonary treatment","Disease-induced breakdown","various non-pulmonary organs","respiratory distress syndrome","genetic variation","multimeric collectin","low protein concentrations","proteolytic breakdown","lung injury","metabolic disorders","risk of atherosclerosis","common SFTPD polymorphism","low-molecular weight forms","allergic asthma","modulation of host cell responses","direct microbial interactions","bronchopulmonary dysplasia","inflammation","biochemical modification","lipid metabolism","vessel walls","mechanistic links","promising biomarker","preclinical animal models","adipocytes","process","systemic leakage","series of cellular receptors","endothelium","innate immune defense","diabetes","basic research","obesity-dampening properties","studies","recent years","review","epithelia","Perspectives"],"language":"en"},

Human SAMD9, a tumor suppressor and a restriction factor for poxviruses in cell lines, is antagonized by two classes of poxvirus proteins, represented by vaccinia virus (VACV) K1 and C7. A paralog of SAMD9, SAMD9L, is also encoded by some mammals, while only one of two paralogs is retained by others. Here, we show that SAMD9L functions similarly to SAMD9 as a restriction factor and that the two paralogs form a critical host barrier that poxviruses must overcome to establish infection. In mice, which naturally lack SAMD9, overcoming SAMD9L restriction with viral inhibitors is essential for poxvirus replication and pathogenesis. While a VACV deleted of both K1 and C7 (vK1L(-)C7L(-)) was restricted by mouse cells and highly attenuated in mice, its replication and virulence were completely restored in SAMD9L(-/-) mice. In humans, both SAMD9 and SAMD9L are poxvirus restriction factors, although the latter requires interferon induction in many cell types. While knockout of SAMD9 with Crispr-Cas9 was sufficient for abolishing the restriction for vK1L(-)C7L(-) in many human cells, knockout of both paralogs was required for abolishing the restriction in interferon-treated cells. Both paralogs are antagonized by VACV K1, C7 and C7 homologs from diverse mammalian poxviruses, but mouse SAMD9L is resistant to the C7 homolog encoded by a group of poxviruses with a narrow host range in ruminants, indicating that host species-specific difference in SAMD9/SAMD9L genes serves as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus transmission.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Yan, Bo; Si, Chuanping; Honda, Hiroaki; Nagamachi, Akiko; Sun, Lu-Zhe; Xiang, Yan","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af6b7e03cb374a3d20ac5fc3477bcc9b772bc7ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5831749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5831749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACV","VACV K1"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SAMD9L restriction","mouse SAMD9L","Human SAMD9","knockout of SAMD9","Host restriction factors","poxvirus restriction factors","SAMD9L genes","SAMD9L functions","paralog of SAMD9","paralogs","poxvirus replication","C7 homologs","VACV K1","mice","critical host barrier","group of poxviruses","viral replication","mouse cells","human cells","diverse mammalian poxviruses","formidable barrier","host species-specific difference","narrow host range","classes of poxvirus proteins","interferon-treated cells","vK1L","C7L","cross-species poxvirus transmission","viral inhibitors","cell lines","interferon induction","cell types","ruminants","vaccinia virus","tumor suppressor","Crispr-Cas9","evolved counter-measures","pathogenesis","virulence","humans","infection","mammals"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination against BRD-associated viruses does not offer complete immune protection and vaccine failure animals present potential routes for disease spread. Serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is possible using antigen-deleted vaccines, but during virus outbreaks DIVA responses are masked by wild-type virus preventing accurate serodiagnosis. Previous work by the authors has established the potential for metabolomic profiling to reveal metabolites associated with systemic immune responses to vaccination. The current study builds on this work by demonstrating for the first time the potential to use plasma metabolite profiling to differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals following infection-challenge. Male Holstein Friesian calves were intranasally vaccinated (Pfizer RISPOVAL(\u00AE)PI3\u002BRSV) and subsequently challenged with Bovine Parainfluenza Virus type-3 (BPI3V) via nasal inoculation. Metabolomic plasma profiling revealed that viral challenge led to a shift in acquired plasma metabolite profiles from day 2 to 20 p.i., with 26 metabolites identified whose peak intensities were significantly different following viral challenge depending on vaccination status. Elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin and decreased 3-indolepropionic acid in non-vaccinated animals at day 6 p.i. may be associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen scavenging at periods of peak virus titre. During latter stages of infection, increased levels of N-[(3\u03B1,5\u03B2,12\u03B1)-3,12-dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine and lysophosphatidycholine and decreased enterolactone in non-vaccinated animals may reflect suppression of innate immune response mechanisms and progression to adaptive immune responses. Levels of hexahydrohippurate were also shown to be significantly elevated in non-vaccinated animals from days 6 to 20 p.i. These findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic profiling to identify plasma markers that can be employed in disease diagnostic applications to both differentially identify infected non-vaccinated animals during disease outbreaks and provide greater information on the health status of infected animals.","publish_time":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gray, Darren W.; Welsh, Michael D.; Mansoor, Fawad; Doherty, Simon; Chevallier, Olivier P.; Elliott, Christopher T.; Mooney, Mark H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27fb200a637c8fff339f06399be1d563e365a7a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5886402.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886402/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected non-vaccinated animals","potential of metabolomic profiling","Metabolomic plasma profiling","health status of infected animals","plasma metabolite profiling","disease outbreaks","virus outbreaks DIVA responses","vaccine failure animals present potential routes","adaptive immune responses","systemic immune responses","disease spread","infection-challenge","plasma markers","vaccination status","wild-type virus","Bovine Respiratory Disease","plasma metabolite profiles","Bovine Parainfluenza Virus type","complete immune protection","different following viral challenge","periods of peak virus titre","disease diagnostic applications","metabolites","increased levels of N","BRD-associated viruses","Elevated levels of biliverdin","Levels of hexahydrohippurate","Serological differentiation of infected","suppression of innate immune response mechanisms","peak intensities","decreased enterolactone","stages of infection","Previous work","increased oxidative stress","progression","reactive oxygen","lysophosphatidycholine","greater information","indolepropionic acid","major source of economic loss","glycine","bilirubin","antigen-deleted vaccines","BPI3V","shift","Pfizer RISPOVAL","yl","accurate serodiagnosis","authors","Male Holstein Friesian calves","findings","time","days","agricultural industry","dioxocholan","RSV","nasal inoculation","current study","dihydroxy"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the V920 vaccine is capable of replicating in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species and of replicating in live mosquitoes. While the V920 vaccine replicated well in Vero cells, no replication was observed in Anopheles or Aedes mosquito, Culicoides biting midge, or Lutzomyia sand fly cells, nor in live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes following exposure through intrathoracic inoculation or feeding on a high-titer infectious blood meal. The insect taxa selected for use in this study represent actual and potential epidemic vectors of VSV. V920 vaccine inoculated into Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated persistence of replication-competent virus following inoculation, consistent with the recognized biological stability of the vaccine, but no evidence for active virus replication in live mosquitoes was observed. Following administration of an infectious blood meal to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at a titer several log(10) PFU more concentrated than would be observed in vaccinated individuals, no infection or dissemination of V920 was observed in either mosquito species.

Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment. Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological intervention, including telephone psychological counseling (active and passive), self-adjustment of written materials and one-to-one psychological crisis intervention. Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental health status of all patients on the day of admission and 1 week after treatment. Results:The scores of HAMA and HAMD of all patients (including isolation ward and observation ward) were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the time of admission. The total score of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were both higher than that General Pneumonia group.

The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (\u201Ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201D), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (\u201CAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2\u201D) protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics. To that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 \u0026 SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures - including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing - may be required to reduce transmission. Using a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40,162 UK participants, we simulated the impact of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing and physical distancing scenarios. As well as estimating reduction in effective reproduction number, we estimated, for a given level of COVID-19 incidence, the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated that combined testing and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone (50-65% compared to 2-30%). If limits are placed on gatherings outside of home/school/work (e.g. maximum of 4 daily contacts in other settings), then manual contact tracing of acquaintances only could have a similar effect on transmission reduction as detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where there were 10,000 new symptomatic cases per day, we estimated in most contact tracing strategies, 140,000 to 390,000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimates that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number that is below one in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kucharski, Adam J; Klepac, Petra; Conlan, Andrew; Kissler, Stephen M; Tang, Maria; Fry, Hannah; Gog, Julia; Edmunds, John","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cdd84cbbaa193437e5665afb32b365d75a6077f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077024v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BBC Pandemic","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tracing of contacts","contact tracing strategies","detailed contact tracing","number of contacts","self-isolation","manual contact tracing of acquaintances","additional physical distancing measures","moderate physical distancing measures","intensive physical distancing","physical distancing scenarios","transmission reduction","Isolation of symptomatic cases","level transmission","daily contacts","day","novel digital tracing approaches","combination of measures","combined testing","different strategies","high proportion of cases","effective reproduction number","mass testing","early COVID","range of different testing","school","given level of COVID","new symptomatic cases","work","need","country-specific COVID","estimating reduction","control of infection","responses","countries","previous modelling studies","analysis estimates","similar effect","UK participants","date","impact","household","incidence","settings","containment measure","BBC Pandemic data","plausible assumptions","model of individual","disruption","populations","gatherings","home","outbreaks","limits","absence"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care. This article addresses operational decision-making during the epidemic. Development: We report the measures taken, including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan, strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management, the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care, provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients, decisions about complementary testing and periodic in-hospital treatments, and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures. Conclusion: Despite the situation of confinement, neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation. Like all elements of management, these must be evaluated.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mat\u00EDas-Guiu, Jorge; Porta-Etessam, Jesus; Lopez-Valdes, Eva; Garcia-Morales, Irene; Guerrero-Sol\u00E1, Antonio; Matias-Guiu, Jordi A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8621c540b04c06f609cf66857b87625178eefc80.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320300669; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320300669?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["and the","The COVID","including the preparation of","maintain the provision of neurological care","Despite the situation of confinement","We report the","of telephone consultations","making during the epidemic","the need for unprecedented decisions","provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients","of a specific telephone service","maintain neurological care","Like all elements of management","provide patient care through different means of operation","for hospitalisation and emergency management","hospital treatments","asistencia neurol\u00F3gica","atenci\u00F3n neurol\u00F3gica","toma de decisiones operativas","f\u00F3rmulas operativas","be made","these must be evaluated","pacientes preferentes","pandemia de Covid","f\u00F3rmulas empleadas","decisions about complementary testing and periodic in","Abstract Introduction","Abstract Introducci\u00F3n","functional reorganisation plan","plan de reorganizaci\u00F3n funcional","realizaci\u00F3n de consultas telef\u00F3nicas","neurology departments must continue","prioritise patients with epileptic","taken","led","operational decision","exploraciones complementarias","tel\u00E9fono","tratamientos intrahospitalarios peri\u00F3dicos","\u00E1rea externa","urgencias","hospitalizaci\u00F3n","estrategias","mantenimiento","Conclusion","This article","Development","servicios de neurolog\u00EDa","situaci\u00F3n de aislamiento","priorizaci\u00F3n de crisis epil\u00E9pticas","autores","elemento de gesti\u00F3n","Desarrollo","art\u00EDculo","precedentes","necesidad","Conclusi\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abhari, Reza S.; Marini, Marcello; Chokani, Ndaona","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c49ce45f1785884bc272efad51a66b0210c7e103.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data"],"locations":["Switzerland","Europe","South Korea","sub Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","containment of COVID","entire Swiss population","Swiss demographics","Big Data","EnerPol platform","entire Swiss public","data-driven manner","available statistical data","micro-census data","virus","Various governmental interventions","impacts of various policy scenarios","artificial intelligence simulation platform","future scenarios","time period","aforementioned period","simulation of daily activities","possible transmission pathways","absence of governmental intervention","substantial number of infected individuals","different sectors","capacity of local healthcare facilities","regards","closures","appropriate logistic needs","South Korea","private transport network","Japan","Europe","broad range of case studies","effective measures","people","Saharan Africa","developed agent","cross-border commuters","evolution","present study","health care services","social distancing","country","infection","thousands of lives","relaxation","lockdown","digital tool","spatio-temporal characteristics","deployment of large-scale vaccination","individual contacts","preliminary variability","estimates","use","years","deaths","cases","Switzerland","epidemiology","predictions"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body\u0027s immunity.

Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases. A 10-\u03BCg/m3 increase (lag0\u201314) in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively.

Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months. Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities. Abstract Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US. Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s): COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Christopher JL","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["peak of COVID","non-COVID","Peak demand","confirmed COVID","UI","hospital capacity","timing of deaths","date of peak excess demand","estimated excess demand","hospital utilization","large number of deaths","US states","Peak ventilator use","hospital services","system capacity","peak volumes","statistical model forecasting deaths","licensed capacity","ICU beds","pandemic","months","enactment of social distancing measures","enforcement of social distancing measures","capacity of health facilities","hospital systems","utilization data","total beds","predicted health service utilization","hospital system overload","ICU occupancy","current capacity of hospitals","United States","day","ICU care","study","epidemic","available health service resources","set of estimates","implementation of strategies","Abstract Importance","average annual occupancy rates","national governments","forecasted gaps","addition","websites","locations","Key Points Question","Participants","plans","extent","urgent need","Relevance","Setting","Main outcome","development","maintenance","Design","Conclusions","Findings","Results","enforcing","Exposure","Objective","ventilators","weeks"],"language":"en"},

To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686 (PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs might be involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 \u03BCM, 0.12 \u03BCM, and 26.4 \u03BCM, respectively. Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation.

COVID-19 pandemic poses a burden on hospital resources and intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. The study aimed to derive a scoring system that, assessed upon patient first-contact evaluation, predicts the need for admission to ICU. Methods. All consecutive patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center were prospectively assessed. Patients were segregated into a group that required admission to ICU during their hospitalization and a group that never required ICU admission and was already discharged from hospitalization. Three models including clinical, laboratory and imaging findings were derived by logistic regression analysis and internally validated. A score, defined as the ABC-GOALS score was created by assigning values based on the variables weighted odd ratios. Results. The study comprised 329 patients, 115 (35%) required ICU admission and 214 (65%) were hospitalized and discharged from general wards. The clinical prediction model (ABC-GOALSc) included sex, obesity, the Charlson comorbidity index, dyspnea, arterial pressure and respiratory rate at triage evaluation. The clinical plus laboratory model (ABC-GOALScl) added serum albumin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase and S/F ratio to the clinical model. The model that included imaging (ABC-GOALSclx) added the CT scan finding of \u003E50% lung involvement. All three models outperformed other pneumonia-specific scores with area under the curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.83), 0.86 (0.82-0.90) and 0.88 (0.84-0.92) for the clinical, laboratory and imaging model, respectively. Conclusion.

Currently with just under 7000 cases and 100 deaths, Australia is seeing less than 20 new cases per day. This is a positive outcome, but makes estimation of current effective reproduction numbers difficult to estimate. Australia, like much of the world is poised to step out of lockdown and looking at which measures to relax first. We use age-based contact matrices, calibrated to Chinese data on reproduction numbers and difference in infectiousness and susceptibility of children to generate next generation matrices (NGMs) for Australia. These matrices have a spectral radius of 2.49, which is hence our estimated basic reproduction number for Australia. The effective reproduction number (Reff) for Australia during the April/May lockdown period is estimated by other means to be around 0.8. We simulate the impact of lockdown on the NGM by first applying observations through Google Mobility Report for Australia at 3 locations: home (increased contacts by 18%), work (reduced contacts by 34%) and other (reduced contacts by 40%), and we reduce schools to 3% reflecting attendance rates during lockdown. Applying macro-distancing to the NGM leads to a spectral radius of 1.76. We estimate that the further reduction of the reproduction number to current levels of Reff = 0.8 is achieved by a micro-distancing factor of 0.26. That is, in a given location, people are 26% as likely as usual to have an effective contact with another person. We apply both macro and micro-distancing to the NGMs to examine the impact of different exit strategies. We find that reopening schools is estimated to reduce Reff from 0.8 to 0.78. This is because increase in school contact is offset by decrease in home contact. The NGMs all estimate that adults aged 30-50 are responsible for the majority of transmission. We also find that micro-distancing is critically important to maintain Reff \u003C1. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is presented.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"McBryde, E. S.; Trauer, J.

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1\u002B albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF. Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lunwen; Li, Xun; Chen, Hui; Yan, Shaonan; Li, Yan; Li, Dong; Gong, Zuojiong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e45cd5feb7928bbc8bcd524d9c6b7adeae08a6b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CRF","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","treatment of COVID","hospitalized COVID","infection of SARS","renal illness","renal function indicators","urine sediments of enrolled patients","effects of SARS","acute renal function damage","chronic renal failure","Interpretation Acute renal impairment","obvious acute renal injury","exacerbation of CRF","regular continuous renal replacement therapy","clinical data","CRRT","RNA","treatment measures","course of treatment","cases","study","medical history","demographic data","problem worthy of clinical attention","laboratory test results","chest computer tomography","signs","symptoms","scans","potential comorbidities","mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen","Department of Infectious Diseases","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","creatinine","recorded information","trace","ORF","real-time RT-PCR","pulmonary inflammation","basic kidney disease","Summary Background","addition","albuminuria","Methods","times","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Currently, severe and non-severe COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few clinical features, which do not comprehensively characterize complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion in different types. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe and 148 in severe type, from Wuhan, China. The patients\u0027 comorbidity and symptoms (26 features), and blood biochemistry (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest (RF) models using features in each modality were developed and validated to classify COVID-19 clinical types. Using comorbidity/symptom and biochemistry as input independently, RF models achieved \u003E90% and \u003E95% predictive accuracy, respectively. Input features\u0027 importance based on Gini impurity were further evaluated and top five features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, diabetes; D-Dimer, hsTNI, neutrophil, IL-6, and LDH). Combining top 10 multimodal features, RF model achieved \u003E99% predictive accuracy. These findings shed light on how the human body reacts to SARS-CoV-2 invasion as a unity and provide insights on effectively evaluating COVID-19 patient\u0027s severity and developing treatment plans accordingly.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly. Conclusion While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"AMMAR, A.; Brach, M.; Trabelsi, K.; Chtourou, H.; Boukhris, O.; Masmoudi, L.; Bouaziz, B.; Bentlage, E.; How, D.; Ahmed, M.; Mueller, P.; Mueller, N.; Aloui, A.; Hammouda, O.; Paineiras-Domingos, L.

Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and of native human Nsp1-ribosome complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C-terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel.

Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods EMBASE, PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, Tau2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias. Results: 148 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12149 patients (5739 female) and a median age was 47.0 [35.0-64.6]. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication, while 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic.

Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Gaofu; Yang, Haiping; Zhang, Aihua; Shen, Qian; Wang, Li; Li, Zhijuan; Li, Yuhong; Zhao, Lijun; Du, Yue; Sun, Liangzhong; Zhao, Bo; Zhu, Hongtao; Fu, Haidong; Li, Xiaoyan; Gao, Xiaojie; Hao, Sheng; Ding, Juanjuan; Chen, Zongwen; Xu, Zhiquan; Liu, Xiaorong; Wu, Daoqi; Gao, Mingsi; Wang, Mo; Li, Qiu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/530f3ba1a2c044305d73123fd8d2246f63120bc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029199","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CKD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","CKD","outbreak","medical treatment of children","online consultation","COVID","total","treatment centers","medical advice","Chinese children","greatest needs","context","parents","weeks","anonymous online questionnaire survey","management of low income children","medication delivery","greatest concern","psychological counselling","remote rural areas","pediatric nephropathy diagnosis","chronic kidney disease","Methods","changes","approach","solutions","China","data","significant influence","basic information","Materials","experienced anxiety","questions","impact","touch","specialists","families","Multicenter Cross-section Study","valid questionnaires","intervention of psychologists","Results","epidemic","Conclusion","Objective","relapse","nCoV"],"language":"en"},

Rapid Assessment of the Inhalation Resistance Performance of Uncertified Medical Face Masks in the Context of Restricted Resources Imposed during a Public Health Emergency","doi":"10.1101/2020.05.13.20100602","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"In the case of a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, access to large quantities of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) has presented a significant problem. A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady-state flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin-1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting. Although the absolute values of pressure drop measured by this method are unlikely to correlate with other testing approaches, the observed, indicative trends and relative performance of the masks is key to this approach. Critically, this method does not replace certification but it has enabled a public body to quickly make decisions; certify, re-assign, refund, thus saving time and resources. The total time spent conducting the tests was less than 8 hours and the low cost method proposed can be repurposed for low resource regions.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Begg, S.; Emekwuru, N.

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working\u003E 10 years (HR, 2.02; P\u003C0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P\u003C0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P\u003C0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines.

Critical patients with COVID-19 require basic and advanced respiratory support. Therefore, the objective was to describe the ventilatory support strategies in SARS-CoV-2 during intensive therapy. Materials and methods: A systematic review of observational studies of the available scientific literature was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane collaboration and the criteria of the PRISMA Declaration. Results: Fifteen observational studies were included that gave a study population of 4,081 patients. Mechanical ventilation is the main respiratory support treatment for critically ill patients, which should be administered as soon as normal oxygenation cannot be maintained, and despite the fact that there is no current consensus on the parameters of mechanical ventilation, the evidence collected suggests the use of Fio2 on average 50%, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, lung compliance of 29-37 ml per cm of water, driving pressure between 12-14 cm of water and a plateau pressure of 22-25 cm of water. Conclusions: IL-6 is shown as a possible marker of respiratory failure and a worse prognosis as well as obesity.

Methods: Following expedited approval from our Institutional Review Board, we analyzed retrospectively collected data from consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on a positive polymerase chain reaction testing at our institution from March 03, 2020 to April 7, 2020. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and patient-reported symptom data were collected at presentation in the emergency room. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between hospitalization and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: During this study period, we identified 207 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. 34.5% noted concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms; of which 90% of gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. In a multivariate regression model controlled for demographics and disease severity, an increased risk for hospitalization was noted in patients with any gastrointestinal symptom (adjusted OR 4.84 95% CI: 1.68-13.94]. Diarrhea was associated with a seven-fold higher likelihood for hospitalization (adjusted OR=7.58, 95% CI: 2.49-20.02, P \u003C0.001) and nausea or vomiting had a four times higher odds (adjusted OR 4.39, 95% CI: 1.61-11.4, P = 0.005).

We examined whether healthier and wealthier places more successfully implemented social distancing. Methods: Mobile device location data were used to quantify declines in movement by county (n=2,633) in the United States of America, comparing April 15-17 (n=65,544,268 traces) to baseline of February 17 - March 7. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate gradients of privilege across eleven healthcare and economic indicators, adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home mandates. External validation used separate venue-specific data from Google Location Services. Findings: Counties without stay-at-home orders showed a mobility decline of -52.3% (95% CI: -50.3%, -54.3%), slightly less than the decline in mandated areas (-60.8%; 95% CI: -60.0%, -61.6%). Strong linear gradients in privilege were observed. After adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home orders, counties in the highest quintile of social distancing mobility restriction had: 52% less uninsured, 47% more primary care providers, 29% more exercise space, 27% less food insecurity, 26% less child poverty, 17% higher incomes, 14% less overcrowding, 9.6% more racial segregation, 8.2% less youth, 7.4% more elderly, and 6.2% less influenza vaccination, compared to least social distancing areas. Interpretation: Healthier and wealthier counties displayed a social distancing privilege gap, measured via smartphone mobility change.

Objective: To estimate the CFR applying a delay-adjusted method across countries, exploring differences to simple methods and potential correlation to country level variables. Methods: Secondary analysis of publicly available data from countries with [\u2265]500 cases by April 30th. We calculated CFR adjusting for delay time from diagnosis to death and using simple methods for comparison. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to pooling CFRs for all countries and for those with high testing coverage and low positivity rate. We explored correlation of adjusted CFR with age structure and health care resources at country level. Results: We included 107 countries and the Diamond Princess cruise-ship. The overall delay adjusted CFR was 2.8% (95%CI: 2.1 to 3.1) while naive CFR was 5.1% (95%CI: 4.1 to 6.2). In countries with high testing coverage/low positivity rate the pooled adjusted CFR was 2.1% (95%CI: 1.5 to 3.0), there was a correlation with age over 65 years ({beta} = 0.12; 95%CI: 0.06 to 0.18), but not with number of physician or critical care beds. Naive method underestimated the CFR of the CFR with a median of 1.3% across countries. Conclusion: Our best estimation of CFR across countries is 2% and varies according to the aged population size.

Specifically, we found that mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 at passage 6 (MACSp6) efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type BALB/c mice, resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses. The elevated infectivity of MACSp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue (N501Y) in the receptorbinding domain (RBD). Using this novel animal model, we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 MACSp6 challenge. This novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level. Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540). Results. About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] smaller than .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69).

These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to re-use N95 FFRs in emergency situations where re-using FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable.

Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4\u002B T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4\u002B T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4\u002B T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of 1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4\u002B and/or CD8\u002B T cell epitopes, 2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, 3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and 4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes. We believe that future investigations of emerging pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) should include population-wide T cell epitope discovery using blood samples from patients, convalescents and/or long-term survivors, who might all hold important information on T cell epitopes and responses.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stryhn, Anette; Kongsgaard, Michael; Rasmussen, Michael; Harndahl, Mikkel Nors; \u00D8sterbye, Thomas; Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Thybo, S\u00F8ren; Gabriel, Mette; Hansen, Morten Bagge; Nielsen, Morten; Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard; Thomsen, Allan Randrup; Buus, Soren","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fef872feb9484ff76800de33e2cfdf7770d7c675.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.012468","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell epitopes","T cell responses","T cells","T cell epitope discovery approach","evidence of T cell immunodomination","HLA-class","population-wide T cell epitope discovery","HLA tetramers","HLA binding","peptide epitopes","HLA haplotype","HLA-binding core","restricting HLA allotypes","diversity of CD4","non-HLA background","refinement of future peptide-HLA class","CD8","confounding effects of HLA diversity","broad coverage of epitopes","predictors of peptide","generation of peptide","peptides","wide population coverage","false discovery rate","multi-tetramer staining","tetramer technologies","primary Yellow Fever vaccination","double-staining","entire Yellow Fever virus proteome","future investigations of emerging pathogens","blood samples","patients","different flanking regions","convalescents","extensive diversification","cohort","specificities","immunodominant","combination","important information","analysis of ex","considerable academic","unbiased nature","SARS-CoV","protein antigens","true magnitude","humans","risk of pathogen escape","sense","long-term survivors","volunteers","individual","isotypes"],"language":"en"},

Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Guangming; Lin, Hualiang; Chen, Liangjun; Wang, Shichan; Zeng, Zhikun; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Shiyu; Rebmann, Terri; Li, Yirong; Pan, Zhenyu; Yang, Zhonghua; Wang, Ying; Wang, Fubing; Qian, Zhengmin; Wang, Xinghuan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3647d8c1ad273781475e6df02936b4c094d87b98.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","Zhongnan Medical Center","NCP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Measures SARS-CoV","contaminated zones","hospital function zones","contaminated objects","contaminated PPE","ongoing pandemic of SARS","major objects","HCWs","China","NCP","details of hospital environmental contamination status","ongoing outbreak of COVID","highest contamination levels","used objects","medical equipment","epicenter of Wuhan","major personal protection equipment","RNAs","healthcare settings","surfaces","surface swabs","findings","various patient care areas","large number of healthcare workers","infection prevention training","infection prevention precautions","intensive care unit","Obstetric Isolation Ward","care of novel coronavirus pneumonia","various environments","human transmission","RT-PCR","surface samples","adequate environmental cleaning","Zhongnan Medical Center","reverse transcription-PCR","Participants Dacron swabs","urgent need","pregnant women","Importance","Main Outcomes","mist","self-service printers","Hospitals","significant epicenters","laboratory experiment","Relevance","patients","extent","presence","hand sanitizer dispensers","desktop","important implications","Conclusions","visitors","policy","field investigation","keyboard","gloves","Objective","data","doorknob"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) provides a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) function. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) analogues added to the growing RNA chain should supposedly terminate viral RNA replication, but ExoN can cleave the incorporated compounds and counteract their efficacy. Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 12.6 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of remdesivir in nucleotide addition (RdRp complex: nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and proofreading (ExoN complex: nsp14-nsp10). We found that the 1\u2019-cyano group of remdesivir possesses the dual role of inhibiting both nucleotide addition and proofreading. For nucleotide addition, we showed that incorporation of one remdesivir is not sufficient to terminate RNA synthesis. Instead, the presence of the polar 1\u2019-cyano group of remdesivir at an upstream site causes instability via its electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge formed by Asp865 and Lys593, rendering translocation unfavourable. This may eventually lead to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension by three nucleotides. For proofreading, remdesivir can inhibit cleavage via the steric clash between the 1\u2019-cyano group and Asn104. To further examine the role of 1\u2019-cyano group in remdesivir\u2019s inhibitory effects, we studied three additional NTP analogues with other types of modifications: favipiravir, vidarabine, and fludarabine. Our simulations suggest that all three of them are prone to ExoN cleavage. Our computational findings were further supported by an in vitro assay in Vero E6 cells using live SARS-CoV-2. The dose-response curves suggest that among tested NTP analogues, only remdesivir exerts significant inhibitory effects on viral replication. Our work provides plausible mechanisms at molecular level on how remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dong; Yuan, Congmin; Wang, Xiaowei; Li, Yongfang; Jia, Xilin; Gao, Xin; Yen, Hui-Ling; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cb1901fa957cda4ffa0a200ecf8b705eff50440.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.063859","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["cyano group of remdesivir","inhibitory effects of remdesivir","viral RNA replication","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA synthesis","viral replication","growing RNA chain","ExoN complex","molecular mechanisms","nucleotide addition","underlying inhibitory mechanisms","ExoN cleavage","significant inhibitory effects","remdesivir\u2019s inhibitory effects","RdRp complex","delayed chain termination of RNA extension","tested NTP analogues","additional NTP analogues","live SARS-CoV","molecular level","intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease","plausible mechanisms","simulations","high drug efficacy","all-atom molecular dynamics","computational findings","dual role of inhibiting","challenging drug target","new treatments of COVID","electrostatic interactions","upstream site causes instability","nsp8","Vero E6 cells","types of modifications","nsp12-nsp7","Asp865","Lys593","salt bridge","rational design","microseconds","global health crisis","effective interventional therapy","accumulated simulation time","favipiravir","vidarabine","assay","work","function","incorporation","dose-response curves","nsp14-nsp10","translocation unfavourable","nucleotides","incorporated compounds","Nucleoside triphosphate","steric clash","fludarabine","Asn104","presence"],"language":"en"},

Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3\u2019-fluoro-3\u2019-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3\u2019-azido-3\u2019-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension.

These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ju, Jingyue; Li, Xiaoxu; Kumar, Shiv; Jockusch, Steffen; Chien, Minchen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Morozova, Irina; Kalachikov, Sergey; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Russo, James J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.989186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV RdRp","inhibitors of SARS","SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","deoxythymidine triphosphate","activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir","high-fidelity DNA polymerase","active triphosphate forms of Alovudine","model polymerase extension experiments","FDA approved HIV","AZT","coronavirus replication","activities of viral inhibitors","coronavirus family","anti-viral agents","nucleotide analogues","potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents","HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors","FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA","AIDS drug","molecular structures","molecular insight","low-fidelity polymerases","analysis of hepatitis C virus","evaluation","Velpatasvir","global public health emergency","ability","host","fluoro","azido","coronaviruses","RdRps","amino acid similarity","guidance","incorporation","member","results"],"language":"en"},

As of 1st May 2020, the Italian health authorities reported 28,238 deaths nationally. To control the epidemic, the Italian government implemented a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school and university closures, social distancing and full lockdown involving banning of public gatherings and non essential movement. In this report, we model the effect of NPIs on transmission using data on average mobility. We estimate that the average reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) is currently below one for all Italian regions, and significantly so for the majority of the regions. Despite the large number of deaths, the proportion of population that has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (the attack rate) is far from the herd immunity threshold in all Italian regions, with the highest attack rate observed in Lombardy (13.18% [10.66%-16.70%]). Italy is set to relax the currently implemented NPIs from 4th May 2020. Given the control achieved by NPIs, we consider three scenarios for the next 8 weeks: a scenario in which mobility remains the same as during the lockdown, a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 20%, and a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 40%. The scenarios explored assume that mobility is scaled evenly across all dimensions, that behaviour stays the same as before NPIs were implemented, that no pharmaceutical interventions are introduced, and it does not include transmission reduction from contact tracing, testing and the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases. New interventions, such as enhanced testing and contact tracing are going to be introduced and will likely contribute to reductions in transmission; therefore our estimates should be viewed as pessimistic projections. We find that, in the absence of additional interventions, even a 20% return to pre-lockdown mobility could lead to a resurgence in the number of deaths far greater than experienced in the current wave in several regions. Future increases in the number of deaths will lag behind the increase in transmission intensity and so a second wave will not be immediately apparent from just monitoring of the daily number of deaths. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as mobility should be closely monitored in the next weeks and months. To compensate for the increase in mobility that will occur due to the relaxation of the currently implemented NPIs, adherence to the recommended social distancing measures alongside enhanced community surveillance including swab testing, contact tracing and the early isolation of infections are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of resurgence in transmission.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vollmer, M.

We evaluated the impact of small-area lockdowns in Chile, aimed to reduce viral transmission while minimizing the population disrupted. The effectiveness of this intervention on the outbreak control is unknown. Methods A natural experiment assessing the impact of small-area lockdowns between February 15th and April 25th, 2020. We used mobility data and official governmental reports to compare regions with small-area lockdowns versus regions without. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the effective reproductive number (Re) of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were changes in mobility indicators. We used quasi-experimental methods for the analysis and examined the impact of other concurrent public health interventions to disentangle their effects. Results Small-area lockdown produced a sizable reduction in human mobility, equivalent to an 11.4% reduction (95%CI -14.4% to -8.38%) in public transport and similar effects in other mobility indicators. Ten days after implementation, the small-area lockdown produced a reduction of the effective reproductive number (Re) of 0.86 (95%CI -1.70 to -0.02). School and university closures, implemented earlier, led to a 40% reduction in urban mobility. Closure of educational institutions resulted in an even greater Re reduction compared with small-area lockdowns. Conclusions Small-area lockdowns produced a reduction in mobility and viral transmission, but the effects were smaller than the early closures of schools and universities. Small-area lockdowns may have a relevant supporting role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and could be useful for countries considering scaling-down stricter social distancing interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuadrado, C.; Monsalves, M.

In order to prevent the epidemic, lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. To explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by COVID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal (PD) patients during the lockdown period. Methods: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients\u0027 trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. Results: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00-19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms. HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs 8.00) (p\u003C0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. There was no significant difference on further demand of psychological support between the two groups.

From a public health perspective, rapid patient isolation is also extremely important to curtail the rapid spread of the disease. From this point of view the proposed method offers an easy to use and understand tool to the front-line medics. It is of huge importance not only the statistical accuracy and other measures, but also the ability to understand and interpret how the decision was made. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to surpass the other published results which were using standard Deep Neural Network in terms of performance. Moreover, it produces highly interpretable results which may be helpful for the early detection of the disease by specialists.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angelov, P.; Soares, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02ee9da0a14f56a8aad930bbdc3d75a6ab2bd16f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078584v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","disease","rapid detection","rapid spread","public health perspective","World Health Organization","global health emergency","published results","proposed approach","interpretable results","paper","advanced public health systems of European countries","rapid patient isolation","eXplainable Deep Learning approach","supreme importance","early detection","huge importance","proposed method","standard Deep Neural Network","lives","terms of performance","computer tomography","statistical accuracy","case","Scan images","number of infected","tool","measures","people","timely treatment","specialists","front-line medics","USA","point","ability","beginning","decision"],"language":"en"},

The prefusion trimer forms a tightly packed structure with three receptor-binding domains clamped down by a segment adjacent to the fusion peptide, significantly different from recently published structures of a stabilized S ectodomain trimer. The postfusion conformation is a rigid tower-like trimer, but decorated by N-linked glycans along its long axis with almost even spacing, suggesting possible involvement in a mechanism protecting the virus from host immune responses and harsh external conditions.

Considering the widely spread COVID-19, it is of great benefit to develop an automated and accurate system for quantification of COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities using thick-section chest CT images. Purpose: To develop a fully automated AI system to quantitatively assess the disease severity and disease progression using thick-section chest CT images. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep learning based system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19 infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. 531 thick-section CT scans from 204 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital from 23 January 2020 to 12 February 2020. The lung abnormalities were first segmented by a deep learning model. To assess the disease severity (non-severe or severe) and the progression, two imaging bio-markers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU). The performance of lung abnormality segmentation was examined using Dice coefficient, while the assessment of disease severity and the disease progression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Cohen\u0027s kappa statistic, respectively. Results: Dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and the manual delineations of two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19 infected lung abnormalities were 0.74 {\u002B/-} 0.28 and 0.76 {\u002B/-} 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement, i.e., 0.79 {\u002B/-} 0.25. The computed two imaging bio-markers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.9680 (p-value \u003C 0.001). Very good agreement ({kappa} = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists were achieved on evaluating the changes of infection volumes. Conclusions: A deep learning based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities, assess the disease severity and its progressions.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Z.; Zhong, Z.; Li, Y.; Zhang, T.; Gao, L.; Jin, D.; Sun, Y.; Ye, X.; Yu, L.; Hu, Z.; Xiao, J.; Huang, L.; Tang, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e61b5ec10a7aac1e867d38022a6fc9741a5e5387.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20070219v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thick-section CT imaging","thick-section chest CT images","Thick-section CT scanners","thick-section CT scans","disease progression","associated lung abnormalities","infected lung abnormalities","automated AI system","quantification of COVID","appointed COVID","spread COVID","assessment of disease severity","deep learning based AI system","deep learning based system","accurate system","infected lung regions","performance of lung abnormality segmentation","non-severe stages","deep learning model","imaging bio-markers","AUC","Dice coefficient","portion of infection","average infection HU","changes of infection volumes","experienced radiologists","good agreement","Cohen\u0027s kappa statistic","inter-observer agreement","retrospective study","area","manual delineations","characteristic curve","receiver","Conclusions","Background","patients","Methods","iHU","Results","developing countries","great benefit","Materials","p-value","hospital","progressions","Purpose"],"language":"en"},

Because this RNA virus can mutate massively without a specifically tracing maker. Herein, using a geographic stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2599 full-genome sequences, we identified that two SNPs (i.e., 1059.C\u003ET and 25563.G\u003ET) of linkage disequilibrium were presented in approximately half of North America SARS-CoV-2 population (p = 2.44 x 10\u2212212 and p = 2.98 x 10\u2212261), resulting two missense mutations (i.e., Thr 265 Ile and Gln 57 His) in ORF1ab and ORF3a, respectively. Interestingly, these two SNPs exclusively occurred in the North America dominated clade 1, accumulated during mid to late March, 2020. We did not find any of these two SNPs by retrospectively tracing the two SNPs in bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV-2 from the first epicenter Wuhan or other regions of China mainland. This suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 population of Chinese mainland were different from the prevalent strains of North America. Time-dependently, we found that these two SNPs first occurred in Europe SARS-CoV-2 (26-Feb-2020) which was 3 days early than the occurring date of North America isolates and 17 days early for Asia isolates (Taiwan China dominated). Collectively, this population genetic analysis highlights a well-confidential transmission route of the North America isolates and the two SNPs we newly identified are possibly novel diagnosable or druggable targets for surveillance and treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ou, Xumin; Yang, Zhishuang; Zhu, Dekang; Mao, Sai; Wang, Mingshu; Jia, Renyong; Chen, Shun; Liu, Mafeng; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhao, Xinxin; Zhang, Shaqiu; huang, Juan; Gao, Qun; Liu, Yunya; Zhang, Ling; Peopplenbosch, Maikel; Pan, Qiuwei; Cheng, Anchun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.092056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","China","Europe","Asia","Taiwan China"],"keyphrases":["SNPs","human SARS-CoV","half of North America SARS-CoV","Europe SARS-CoV","pangolin related SARS-CoV","prevalent strains of North America","occurring date of North America isolates","human population","population of Chinese mainland","Asia isolates","population genetic analysis","days","regions of China mainland","well-confidential transmission route","Taiwan China","genome sequences","geographic stratified genome-wide association study","druggable targets","surveillance","GWAS","bat","Thr","linkage disequilibrium","epicenter Wuhan","Gln","Ile","treatment","clade","missense mutations","ORF1ab","pandemic","RNA virus","ORF3a","COVID","maker","Time"],"language":"en"},

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woelfel, Roman; Corman, Victor Max; Guggemos, Wolfgang; Seilmaier, Michael; Zange, Sabine; Mueller, Marcel A; Niemeyer, Daniela; Vollmar, Patrick; Rothe, Camilla; Hoelscher, Michael; Bleicker, Tobias; Bruenink, Sebastian; Schneider, Julia; Ehmann, Rosina; Zwirglmaier, Katrin; Drosten, Christian; Wendtner, Clemens","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bbfd3d34ee18ea1b9f4669331a6cee9c5992893.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lower respiratory tract symptoms","upper respiratory tract disease","upper respiratory tract tissues","lower respiratory tract infection","viral load courses","Average viral load","end of symptoms","symptoms end","Proof of active viral replication","detection of subgenomic viral RNA","hospitalized cases","analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates","adjustments of current case definitions","RT-PCR","nasopharyngeal swabs","sensitive case","Active replication","sputum samples","COVID","stool","days","week of illness","Clinical sensitivity of RT","coronavirus disease","Infectious virus","present study","overall clinical appearance","Live virus isolates","re-evaluation","blood","76x10E5 copies","urine","findings","prospects of outbreak containment","neutralization testing","cell culture","epidemic","differences","prolonged time","Methods","Results","immune response","Serology","Conclusions","Background","epicenter","SARS-CoV","Seroconversion"],"language":"en"},

Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P\u003C0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (\u003C0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damas, Joana; Hughes, Graham M.; Keough, Kathleen C.; Painter, Corrie A.; Persky, Nicole S.; Corbo, Marco; Hiller, Michael; Koepfli, Klaus-Peter; Pfenning, Andreas R.; Zhao, Huabin; Genereux, Diane P.; Swofford, Ross; Pollard, Katherine S.; Ryder, Oliver A.; Nweeia, Martin T.; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; Teeling, Emma C.; Karlsson, Elinor K.; Lewin, Harris A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9ab4537c3ddad7efce17cfad8e775f1c8600d6f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.045302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","main receptor of SARS","multiple species","different species","binding score","high category","study cross-species conservation of ACE2","high categories","binding sites","high risk","conservation properties","identification of intermediate host species","conservation of animals","mammals","amino acid changes","selection of animal models of COVID","human care","amino acids important","evidence of positive selection","human population data","protein structural analysis","cause of Coronavirus Disease","number of predicted unfavorable changes","variable residues","routes of transmission","native habitats","catarrhine primates","sensitivity","angiotensin","likelihood","vertebrates","extensive scrutiny","variants","medium","bats","unique dataset","addition","enzyme","infection","results"],"language":"en"},

Attempts to resolve these complexities have led to the proposal of a variety of trial designs, including individual randomization and several types of cluster randomization designs: parallel-arm, ring vaccination, and stepped wedge designs. Because of the strong time trends present in infectious disease incidence, however, methods generally used to analyze stepped wedge trials may not perform well in these settings. Using simulated outbreaks, we evaluate various designs and analysis methods, including recently proposed methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials, to determine the statistical properties of these methods. While new methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials can provide some improvement over previous methods, we find that they still lag behind parallel-arm cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials in achieving adequate power to detect intervention effects.

Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing the efficacy of serostatus on future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kahn, R.; Kennedy-Shaffer, L.; Grad, Y.; Robins, J.

DESIGN Retrospective, observational case series. SETTING Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital PARTICIPANTS Thirty-three patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to hospital. Data were collected from January 27 to April 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Throat swabs, sputum, stool, and blood samples were collected, and viral load was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific IgM and IgG against spike protein (S), spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) were analyzed. RESULTS At the early stages of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in throat swabs and sputum, but lower in stool. The median (IQR) time of undetectable viral RNA in throat swab, sputum, and stool was 18.5 (13.25-22) days, 22 (18.5-27.5) days, and 17 (11.5-32) days, respectively. In sputum, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days (short persistence), and 16 (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA more than 22 days (long persistence). Three patients (9.1%) had a detectable relapse of viral RNA in sputum within two weeks of their discharge from the hospital. One patient had persistent viral RNA for 59 days or longer. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5) days, 14 (9-24) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG was 10 (7.25-16.5) days, 13 (9-17) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. By week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels were 4-times higher in convalescence than in acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA coexisted with antibodies for more than 50 days. Anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels, including anti-RBD IgM levels at presentation and peak time, were significantly higher in viral RNA short persistence patients than in long persistence patients. CONCLUSION This study adds important new information about the features of viral load and antibody dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It is clear from these results that the viral RNA persists in sputum and stool specimens for a relatively long time in many patients. Anti-RBD may also serve as a potential protective antibody against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as viral persistence appears to be related to anti-RBD levels. Earlier treatment intervention also appears to be a factor in viral persistence.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jianping; Mao, Tingting; Li, Shufei; Wu, Lianpeng; Xu, Xueqin; Li, Huanzheng; xu, Chenyang; Su, Feifei; Dai, Jianyi; Shi, Jichan; Cai, Jing; Huang, Chongquan; Lin, Xuan; Chen, Dong; Lin, Xiaoling; Sun, Baochang; Tang, Shaohua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbfcc8ef7d0b19fda8e3d2001b34744c303af83b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20071258v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","viral persistence","anti-RBD levels","anti-RBD IgG levels","anti-RBD IgM levels","dynamics of viral RNA","persistent viral RNA","viral RNA short persistence patients","anti-N IgG","anti-N IgM","time of undetectable viral RNA","long persistence patients","sputum","detectable relapse of viral RNA","SARS-CoV","seroconversion time of anti-S IgG","seroconversion time of anti-S IgM","features of viral load","positive patients","Specific IgM","long time","peak levels","peak time","antibody dynamics of SARS","IQR","median","stool specimens","times higher","pneumonia","RESULTS","Peoples Hospital PARTICIPANTS","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Throat swabs","early stages of symptom onset","RT-PCR","week period","spike protein receptor binding domain","reverse transcription PCR","potential protective antibody","important new information","laboratory","presentation","weeks","relationships","SETTING Wenzhou","blood samples","observational case series","DESIGN Retrospective","CONCLUSION","study","convalescence","infection","acute phase","discharge","nucleocapsid","factor","antibodies","ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE","Earlier treatment intervention","Data"],"language":"en"},

We consider a divide and conquer strategy in which a high risk group (HRG) is put on strict isolation, whereas the remainder of the population is exposed to the virus, building up immunity against Covid-19. The question is whether this strategy may suppress the effective reproduction number below the critical value of R_eff \u003C 1 without further lockdown once the HRG is released from isolation. While this proposal appears already rather academic, we show that R_eff \u003C 1 can only be obtained provided that the HRG is less than ~20-30% of the total population. Hence, this strategy is likely to fail in countries with a HRG larger than the given upper bound. In addition, we argue that the maximum infection rate occurring in this strategy is likely to exceed realistic capacities of most health care systems. While the conclusion is rather negative in this regard, we emphasise that the strategy of stopping the curve at an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic has a chance to work out. The required duration of the lockdown is estimated to be {tau} ~ 14 days/(1-R_eff) (up to some order one factor) for R_eff \u003C 1, provided a systematic tracing strategy of new infections exists for the subsequent relaxation phase. In this context we also argue why R_eff remains the crucial parameter which needs to be accurately monitored and controlled.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mangat, P.

Here, we present the first results of the analyses that we have performed on 34 PM10 samples of outdoor/airborne PM10 from an industrial site of Bergamo Province, collected with two different air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period, from February 21st to March 13th. We can confirm to have reasonably demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by detecting highly specific RtDR gene on 8 filters in two parallel PCR analyses. This is the first preliminary evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on outdoor particulate matter, thus suggesting that, in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations of PM, SARS-CoV-2 could create clusters with outdoor PM and, by reducing their diffusion coefficient, enhance the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere. Further confirmations of this preliminary evidence are ongoing, and should include real-time assessment about the vitality of the SARS-CoV-2 as well as its virulence when adsorbed on particulate matter. At the present, no assumptions can be made concerning the correlation between the presence of the virus on PM and COVID-19 outbreak progression. Other issues to be specifically addressed are the average concentrations of PM eventually required for a potential boost effect of the contagion (in case it is confirmed that PM might act as a carrier for the viral droplet nuclei), or even the theoretic possibility of immunization consequent to minimal dose exposures at lower thresholds of PM.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Baribieri, Pierluigi; Perrone, Maria Grazia; Borelli, Massimo; Palmisani, Jolanda; Di Gilio, Alessia; Torboli, Valentina; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; PISCITELLI, PRISCO; Miani, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c791e5296024ab05564750b9bf14d7e55f036d0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20065995","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","outdoor PM","presence of SARS","high concentrations of PM","average concentrations of PM","outdoor particulate matter","preliminary evidence","viral RNA","PM10 samples of outdoor","airborne PM10","viral droplet nuclei","parallel PCR analyses","theoretic possibility of immunization consequent","minimal dose exposures","filters","industrial site of Bergamo Province","specific RtDR gene","conditions of atmospheric stability","lower thresholds of","different air samplers","contagion","persistence","potential boost effect","carrier","COVID","vitality","real-time assessment","infection","case","outbreak progression","correlation","confirmations","spreading","clusters","weeks period","diffusion coefficient","viruses","atmosphere","assumptions","virulence","previous communications","results","issues"],"language":"en"},

The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P\u003E0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P\u003C0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K\u002B loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K\u002B supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K\u002B loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K\u002B loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"chen, dong; Li, Xiaokuni; song, qifa; Hu, Chenchan; Su, Feifei; Dai, Jianyi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/264a816e7099246c13a5dad3a581a474d85d50bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":["Wenzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["severe hypokalemia patients","severity of hypokalemia","correction of hypokalemia","clinical implications of hypokalemia","prevalent hypokalemia METHODS","primary cause of hypokalemia","normokalemia patients","ill patients","CK-MB","loss","elevated CK","series of COVID","RAS system","LDH","end of urine","SARS-CoV","hospital","CRP","renin-angiotensin system","clinical features","binds angiotensin","underlying causes","g potassium","degradation of ACE2","normokalemia group","end of adverse effect","median age","women","enzyme","relationship","China","sensitive biomarker","good prognosis","Body temperature","IQR","time","SD","Wenzhou","day","average","years","BACKGROUND","supplements","exciting finding","Gastrointestinal symptoms","CONCLUSIONS","recovery","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A number of studies and reviews have been performed regarding the use of medical grade masks like surgical masks, N95 respirators etc. However, the use of cloth masks has received little attention. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to analyze the available data regarding the use of cloth masks for the prevention of respiratory infections. We intended to use data from both clinical and non-clinical studies to arrive at our conclusion. Methods: We used PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar as our source databases. Both clinical and non-clinical studies, which had data regarding the efficacy of cloth masks, were selected. Articles not containing analyzable data including opinion articles, review articles etc. were excluded. After screening the search results, ten studies could be included in our review. Data relevant to our objective was extracted from each study including clinical efficacy, compliance, filtration efficacy etc. Data from some studies were simplified for the purpose of comparison. Extracted data was summarized and categorized for detailed analysis. Qualitative synthesis of the data was performed. But the heterogeneity between the studies did not allow for a meta-analysis. Discussion: The review was limited by a lack of sufficient clinical studies. Lack of standardization between studies was another limitation. Although cloth masks generally perform poorer than the medical grade masks, they may be better than no masks at all. Filtration efficacy varied greatly depending on the material used, with some materials showing a filtration efficacy above 90%. However, leakage could reduce efficacy of masks by about 50%. Standardization of cloth masks and appropriate use is essential for cloth masks to be effective. However, result of a randomized controlled trial suggest that they may be ineffective in the healthcare setting.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mondal, A.; Das, A.; Goswami, R.

The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov-2 genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (\u223C 1000s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly 30, 000 nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly 1, 000 samples per category.

Patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection requiring admission to UHB between 10th March 2020 and 17th April 2020 Exposure. Ethnicity Main outcome measures. Standardised Admission Ratio (SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each ethnicity was calculated using observed sex specific age distributions of COVID19 admissions/deaths and 2011 census data for Birmingham/Solihull. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated for each ethnic group with white population as reference group, using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation and co-morbidities, and propensity score matching. Results. 2217 patients admitted to UHB with a proven diagnosis of COVID19 were included. 58.2% were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co morbidities. 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger (median age 61 years vs.77 years), have no co morbidities (27.8% vs. 16.6%) but a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.0% vs 28.2%) than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted. South Asian patients were also more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.66 (95%CI 1.32 to 2.10)) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, (Hazard ratio 1.68 (1.33 to 2.13), using the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not.

This pandemic is the result of a zoonotic coronavirus, Severe Acute Respirsatory Syndrom Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is believed to have originated in bats and transferred to humans possibly through an intermediate host species (Zhou et al. 2020; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2020). The virus attacks host cells by attaching to a cell membrane surface protein receptor called ACE2 (Ge et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2020). Given the critical role of ACE2 as a binding receptor for a number of coronaviruses, we studied the molecular evolution of ACE2 in a diverse range of mammalian species. Using ACE2 as the target protein, we wanted to specifically test the Red Queen hypothesis (Dawkins and Krebs 1979) where the parasite and host engage in an evolutionary arms race which can result in positive selection of their traits associated to their fitness and survival. Our results clearly show a phylogenetically broad evolutionary response, in the form of positive selection detected at the codon-level in ACE2. We see positive selection occurring at deep branches as well as 13 incidents at the species level. We found the strongest level of positive selection in Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), donkey (Equus asinus), large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), and dog (Canis lupus familiaris). At the codon-level, we found up to 10% of ACE2 codons are impacted by positive selection in the mammalian lineages studied. This phylogenetically broad evolutionary arms race can contribute to the emergence of new strains of coronaviruses in different mammalian lineages with a potential to transfer between species given the common binding receptor ACE2. Our study provides a molecular evolutionary perspective to the current pandemic and sheds light on its evolutionary mechanisms. \u201CNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\u201D (Theodosius Dobzhansky)","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hajibabaei, Mehrdad; Singer, Gregory A.

In contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus which cause congenital infections are highly expressed by placental cell types.

Design: observational cohort study. Setting: large Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability. Participants: patients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation. Main outcome measures: care escalation rates, including hospital admission. Results: between 11-29 March 2020, 162/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift.

We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain.

We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging SARSr-CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Shuai; Liu, Meiqin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Wei; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Feng, Siliang; Qi, Feifei; Bao, Linlin; Du, Lanying; Liu, Shuwen; Qin, Chuan; Sun, Fei; Shi, Zhengli; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a476fe38d0cce3c4701331479fe8579737219fb9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.983247","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","pseudovirus infection","viral infection","treatment of infection","S protein-mediated membrane fusion","potent fusion inhibitor","pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor","HR1 domain","protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay","human coronavirus pseudoviruses","plasma membrane fusion capacity superior","S protein S2 subunit","live human coronaviruses","divergent human coronaviruses","Intranasal application of EK1C4","specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","emerging SARSr-CoVs","HR2 domains","EK1 peptide","prophylactics","inhibiting replication","serious threat","mutated amino acid residues","molecular mechanism","helical bundle","challenge","core","mice","COVID","IC50s","spike","HCoV-OC43","enhanced interactions","global public health","HB","China","Wuhan","X-ray crystal structure","prevention","fold","series of lipopeptides","nM"],"language":"en"},

Data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients in an imported cases as model in island outside Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 to 13 March 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data. Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%). The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Follow-up of 160 discharged patients found that 20 patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs or anal swabs or fecal. Conclusions: In light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, early diagnosis and quarantine is important to curb the spread of Covid-19 and intensive treatments in early stage is to prevent patients away from critical condition.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Shijiao; Song, Xingyue; Lin, Feng; Zhu, Haiyan; Wang, Xiaozhi; Li, Min; Ruan, Jianwen; Lin, Changfeng; Liu, Xiaoran; Wu, Qiang; Luo, Zhiqian; Fu, Wenning; Chen, Song; Yuan, Yong; Liu, Shengxing; Yao, Jinjian; Lv, Chuanzhu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d9926ab4fdc7f5b3cf56c331910c1188619d9b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038539","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":["Hainan","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["discharged patients","affected patients","confirmed cases of Covid","imported cases","severe cases","rapid spread of Covid","Wuhan residents","world","real-time RT-PCR","positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs","anal swabs","common symptoms","early diagnosis","early stage","clinical characteristics","pandemic model","laboratory data","common radiologic finding","hypertension","CVD","chest computed tomography","quarantine","ground-glass opacity","intensive treatments","fever","diabetes","onset of illness","demographic","retrospective study","light","island","elderly people","years","admission","coronavirus disease","Hainan province","dry cough","median age","Methods","Conclusions","critical condition","Follow-up","expectoration","females","Background"],"language":"en"},

Design: 2 by 3 experimental design. Setting: Online with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020. Participants: 1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel. Intervention: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of hand washing and physical distancing. Results: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]). Using the terms Passport or Certificate, as opposed to Test, had no significant effect (AOR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62 to 2.48] and AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47 to 1.99] respectively). There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology. Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]) but there was no significant association with intended avoidance of physical contact with others outside of the home (AOR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.93 to 2.03]). Conclusions: Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated with less frequent hand washing. The way antibody testing is described may have implications for the likely impact of testing on transmission rates.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waller, J.; Rubin, G.

Moreover, very limited information is available about SARS-CoV-2 expressed regions and immune responses. In this paper an effort has been made, to facilitate vaccine development by proposing multiple epitopes as potential vaccine candidates by utilising SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data. Here, publicly available RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE and A549 human cell lines were used to construct SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to understand disease pathogenesis and immune responses. In the first step, epitope prediction, MHC class I and II gene identification for epitopes, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservation and crossreactivity analysis with host antigens were performed by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and in the second step, structural compatibility of identified T-and B-cell epitopes were evaluated with MHC molecules and B-cell receptors through molecular docking studies. Quantification of MHC gene expression was also performed that indicated high variation in allele types and expression level of MHC genes with respect to cell lines. In A549 cell line, HLA-A*30:01:01:01 and HLA-B*44:03:01:01 were highly expressed, whereas 92 variants of HLA-A*24 genes such as HLA-A*24:02:01:01, HLA-A*24:286, HLA-A*24:479Q, HLA-A*24:02:134 and HLA-A*24:02:116 were highly expressed in NHBE cell lines. Prevalence of HLA-A*24 alleles was suggested as risk factors for H1N1 infection, and associated with type-1 diabetes. HLA-C*03:03, linked with male infertility factors was also highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cell lines. Finally, three potential T-cell and five B-cell epitopes were selected for molecular docking studies with twenty-two MHC molecules and two B-cell receptors respectively. The results of in silico analysis indicated that proposed epitopes have high potential to recognize immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study will facilitate in vitro and in vivo vaccine related research studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kushwaha, Sandeep Kumar; Kesarwani, Veerbhan; Choudhury, Samraggi; Gandhi, Sonu; Sharma, Shailesh","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a301dbfeaa34ecee30c50501873a1551196cea8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.097170","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHBE","MHC","T-and"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HLA-B","B-cell epitopes","B-cell receptors","utilising SARS-CoV","variants of HLA","Prevalence of HLA","HLA-C","potential T-cell","infected NHBE cell lines","A549 cell line","A549 human cell lines","immune response of SARS","MHC molecules","MHC class","multiple epitopes","proposed epitopes","available RNA-seq data of SARS","potential vaccine candidates","expression level of MHC genes","high potential","Quantification of MHC gene expression","vaccine development","transcriptome data","immune responses","molecular docking studies","vaccine related research studies","step","absence of approved vaccine","H1N1 infection","crossreactivity analysis","high variation","gene identification","silico analysis","risk factors","male infertility factors","structural compatibility of identified T","single-stranded RNA virus","conservation","population coverage","allele types","immunogenicity","antigenicity","respect","host antigens","disease pathogenesis","epitope prediction","regions","limited information","pandemic","drug","alleles","influence of COVID","results","paper","effort","diabetes","study","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19. Methods: Firstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 108CFU /kg/day, considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6 x 108 CFU/kg/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 1010 CFU/kg/day to rats. In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010 /animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37 in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat# HK321). Human clinical study was approved by Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2020-074-04) and a total of 11 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan hankou hospital and Huoshenshan hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed consent. Among them, there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 {\u002B/-} 12 (36-70) years old, and the duration from onset to medication enrollment was 35 {\u002B/-} 19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid positive and 5 patients were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received the oral drug cas001 treatment according to requirement(1 x 109 CFU/capsule, 3 capsules/time, three times a day for 3weeks), with an average follow-up time of 33 {\u002B/-} 15 days (see table 1 for the results). Findings: Western blot analysis shows that reasonable amount of LL-37 were induced by different concentrations of nisin, which means we have successfully constructed cas001. In the pre-clinical safety evaluation test, after three weeks administration of cas001, no adverse effects were observed on the rat\u0027s body weight, food and water intake, hematological or serum biochemical parameters. The results showed that the LD50 of cas001 was higher than that of the 100 times of the expected clinical dose of 6 x 1010 CFU/day. These results showed that cas001 could be safe in animal experiments. In addition, rat pharmacokinetics results showed that the serum concentration of LL-37 reached peak 2 hours after gavage of cas001 and returned to basal level 6 hours after gavage. During study period, the volunteers did not feel any discomfort while taking the cas001 capsules, and two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 were increased in healthy volunteers. cas001 shows definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in the improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test. 11 patients enrolled showed good compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted with the doctors. None of the patients had any adverse reactions. Conclusions Based on above observations, we conclude here that as an oral anti-viral agent, cas001 displayed good safety profiles. It is very hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the cas001, although changes of several symptoms indicate encouraging findings.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, H.; Zhao, Y.; Jiang, X.; Li, Y.; Li, C.; Dong, M.; Luan, Z.; Yan, C.; Jiao, J.; Zhao, C.; Li, H.; Chen, W.; Feng, C.; Tian, L.; Qin, E.; Mu, J.; Zeng, T.; Feng, S.; Wang, S.; Guan, X.; Li, T.; Yu, H.; Zheng, A.; Jin, W.; Sun, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7712758b4ef86ab8fedea1806da58de6b75a318c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20064584v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","Huoshenshan"],"keyphrases":["gavage of cas001","pharmacokinetics of cas001","cas001 capsules","weeks administration of cas001","LD50 of cas001","daily administration of cas001","oral administration of LL","CFU","oral drug cas001 treatment","patients of COVID","serum concentration of LL","Human clinical study","therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL","clinical dose selection","expected clinical dose","male SD rats","tandem repeats of mature human LL","hours","times higher dose","healthy SD rats","treatment group","estimated clinical dosage","rat pharmacokinetics results","rat\u0027s body weight","Huoshenshan hospital","pre-clinical safety evaluation test","Lactococcus lactis","control group","modified organisms","total","specific treatment","study period","healthy volunteers","days","modified food-grade probiotic","verificaition of toxic reaction","acute toxic reaction","Wuhan hankou hospital","nucleic acid positive","nucleic acid negative","conversion of body surface area","bacteria powder","animal experiments","Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital","serum biochemical parameters","delivery of therapeutic proteins","average follow-up time","different concentrations of nisin","nisin-inducible nisA promoter","water intake","economic development","huge loss of life security","sequence","death","social stability","effective approach","necessary reference basis","ELISA kit","mild symptoms","duration","Hycult biotechnology Cat","GMOs","AMPs","adverse effects","requirement","possible target organs","Western blot analysis","basal level","onset","HK321","broad-spectrum activity","S2020","use of living","medication enrollment","countries","Findings","viruses","Coronavirus Disease","addition","efficacy","best","discomfort","years old","point","potential therapies","Background","global epidemic","informed consent","table","order","blood","females","world","Methods","aim","cas001","respiratory symptoms","systemic symptoms","improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms","patients","improvement of results","good compliance","nucleic acid test","lung CT test","good safety profiles","oral anti-viral agent","tolerance","subjective feeling","definite effect","role","changes","effects","conclusion of clinical outcomes","encouraging findings","adverse reactions","Conclusions","observations","doctors"],"language":"en"},

Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for better understanding the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, firstly, we developed a viral post-translational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of viral PTM data. The VPTMdb contains 912 PTM sites that integrate 414 experimental-confirmed PTM sites with 98 proteins in 45 human viruses manually extracted from 162 publications and 498 PTMs extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Secondly, we investigated the viral PTM sequence motifs, the function of target human proteins, and characteristics of PTM protein domains. The results showed that (i) viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation, SUMOylation and N-glycosylation. (ii) The function of human proteins that targeted by viral PTM proteins are related to protein targeting, translation, and localization. (iii) Viral PTMs are more likely to be enriched in protein domains. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites. Finally, an online web server was implemented for users to download viral protein PTM data and predict phosphorylation sites of interest. Author summary Post-translational modifications (PTMs) plays an important role in the regulation of viral proteins; However, due to the limitation of data sets, there has been no detailed investigation of viral protein PTMs characteristics. In this manuscript, we collected experimentally verified viral protein post-translational modification sites and analysed viral PTMs data from a bioinformatics perspective. Besides, we constructed a novel feature-based machine learning model for predicting phosphorylation site. This is the first study to explore the roles of viral protein modification in virus infection using computational methods. The valuable viral protein PTM data resource will provide new insights into virus-host interaction.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Yujia; Zou, Quan; Zhao, Lilin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.019562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral PTM proteins","roles of viral PTMs","viral protein phosphorylation sites","regulation of viral proteins","analysed viral PTMs data","roles of viral protein modification","viral PTM sequence motifs","comprehensive viral PTM datasets","viral protein post-translational modification sites","valuable viral protein PTM data resource","PTM sites","systematic information of viral PTM data","detailed investigation of viral protein PTMs characteristics","mechanism of viral infections","viral post-translational modification database","characteristics of PTM protein domains","protein targeting","function of human proteins","human viruses","function of target human proteins","virus-human interactions","virus infection","field of virus","Author summary Post-translational modifications","virus-host interaction","limitation of data sets","users","VPTMdb","important role","important contribution","novel sequence-based classifier","consensus motifs","novel feature-based machine learning model","new insights","VPTMpre","SUMOylation","computational methods","potential drug targets","bioinformatics perspective","publications","N-glycosylation","online web server","UniProtKB","localization","life cycle","findings","Swiss-","studies","study","results","manuscript","gap"],"language":"en"},

Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was efficiently converted into its triphosphates in cells. When combined with GSK983, it led to large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral genome infection.

To gain a complete understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect commercial driver stress, health, and safety over time, and to mitigate these impacts, research and prevention efforts must be grounded in theoretical perspectives that contextualize these impacts within the chronic stressors already endemic to profession, the historical and ongoing forces that have induced them, and the potentially reinforcing nature of the resulting afflictions. Methods Extant literature reveals how an array of macro-level changes has shaped downstream trucking industry policies, resulting in stressogenic work organization and workplace characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing stressors and introduces novel stressors, with potentially exacerbatory impacts on health and safety disparities. Results As COVID-19 exerts an array of multi-level stressors on commercial drivers, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens to guide research and prevention. Syndemic frameworks can provide the grounding to allow foregoing commercial driver COVID-19 research to transcend the limitations of prevailing research frameworks by contextualizing COVID-19 stressors holistically within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety afflictions. Syndemic-informed prevention efforts can then be implemented that simultaneously tackle multiple afflictions and the macro-level forces that result in the emergence of commercial drivers\u2019 health and safety disparities over time. Conclusions The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial drivers cannot be adequately understood or acted upon in isolation from the endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety disparities that characterize the profession. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention needs syndemic frameworks to holistically understand the impacts of COVID-19 on commercial driver stress, health, and safety, and to identify high-leverage preventive actions.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemke, Michael Kenneth; Apostolopoulos, Yorghos; S\u00F6nmez, Sevil","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/720b38be5940656a68fd797afe4dc832f603ac34.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214140520300815; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140520300815?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["impacts of COVID","safety disparities","foregoing commercial driver COVID","safety afflictions","commercial driver stress","novel stressors","existing stressors","interrelated health","emergence of commercial drivers\u2019 health","contextualizing COVID","profound health","complex system of endemic chronic stressors","array of multi-level stressors","endemic chronic stressors shape drivers\u2019 behavioral","prevention needs syndemic frameworks","exacerbatory impacts","pandemic","limitations of prevailing research frameworks","Syndemic-informed prevention efforts","stressogenic profession","resulting afflictions","macro-level forces","array of macro-level changes","multiple afflictions","time","theoretical perspectives","ongoing forces","stressogenic work organization","appropriate theoretical lens","psychosocial responses","exposures","trucking industry policies","grounding","workplace characteristics","Methods Extant literature","reinforcing nature","Abstract Introduction","isolation","preventive actions","complete understanding","Emerging evidence","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jing; Ouyang, Wen; Chua, Melvin L.K.; Xie, Conghua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a9164999237a46d3d6aed53bd59b17d91a9e6d0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025320","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan University"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cancer patients","majority of cancer treatments","SARS-CoV","elevated risk of SARS","increased risk of COVID","tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University","incidence of severe COVID","hospital visitation","disease surveillance","elevated incidence","ongoing treatment","general population","infection","novel coronavirus disease","different disease types","rapid human","human transmission","outbreak of atypical pneumonia","new type of pneumonia","chemotherapy","place","likely factor","proper isolation protocols","radiotherapy","time","period","unrelated cause","total","recorded deaths","China"],"language":"en"},

To date, strict biosecurity is still the most effective disease prevention and control measures, and the early detection of pathogens is the most important link. Here, we developed a microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system for the first time, which could detected PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV simultaneously, and had advantages of rapid, simple, sensitive, high-throughput, and accurate at point-of-care settings. The lowest detection limits of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip method are 101 copies/\u03BCL, 102 copies/\u03BCL and 102 copies/\u03BCL for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV, respectively. The whole detection procedure can be finished rapidly in 40 min without any cross-reaction with other common swine viruses. A total of 173 clinical swine fecal samples characterized with diarrheal symptoms were used to evaluate the performance of the newly developed system, which presented good stabilities (C.V.s\u003C5%) and specificities (100%), and possessed sensitivities of 92.24%, 92.19% and 91.23% for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV respectively.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term. Conclusions: The long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Hassaan; Patel, Kajal; Greenwood, Darren; Halpin, Stephen; Lewthwaite, Penny; Salawu, Abayomi; Eyre, Lorna; Breen, Andrew; O\u0027Connor, Rory; Jones, Anthony; Sivan, Manoj","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b50e28ff0712a0b383e6f4f6372e42a342d6bec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20067975v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit","ICU","Evidence Tool"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["months follow-up","Coronavirus survivors","Follow-up studies","Coronavirus Infections","reduced quality of life","Pooled analysis of studies","Coronavirus disease","Original studies","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","MERS","respiratory dysfunction","psychological problems","clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks","COVID","long-term clinical problems","reduced exercise capacity","high prevalence","admission","survivors of CoV infections","pooled estimates of prevalence","Level of Evidence Tool","premorbid quality of life","meta-analysis","Intensive Care Unit","long term clinical problems","considerable prevalence of psychological disorders","SARS virus","ICU","hospitalisation","Critical care","PTSD","complications","depression","anxiety","impaired diffusing capacity","different outcomes","OCEBM grading","Systematic review","Evidence-Based Medicine","mental health services","EMBASE","post-traumatic stress disorder","aim","carbon monoxide","severity","Ovid MEDLINE","rehabilitation","Oxford Centre","DLCO","discharge","CINAHL","Data sources","low Short Form","minute walking distance","Design","Conclusions","strategy","timely management","MWD","PsycINFO","literature","limited improvement","Results","search","Objective","scores"],"language":"en"},

Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, Dc, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above Dc traditional epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find Dc ~ 7.2. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thurner, S.; Klimek, P.; Hanel, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3eb2f3562d9045410cdd1a8619f0e19780bec117.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110403v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["growth rate","traditional models","Traditional epidemiological models","linear growth of confirmed cases","recovery rate","new cases","new phase","given transmission rate","Dc traditional epidemiological dynamics","infection numbers","COVID","SIR-type models","countries","new containment regime","containment phase","lockdown measures","applicability of standard compartmental models","actual infection curves","low infection prevalence","structure of contact networks","realistic contact networks","number of days","epidemic peak","severe lockdown","critical number of social contacts","remarkable precision","extended time-periods","empirical estimates","place","result of non-pharmaceutical interventions","Austria","pandemic","puzzling observation","corresponding model","examples","fitting","findings","country","herd immunity","degree","explanation","household-size","probability","parameters"],"language":"en"},

The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data.

To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models. We use the model to assess parameter sensitivity for a number of key variables that characterise the COVID-19 epidemic. We also test several control parameters with respect to their influence on the severity of the outbreak. Our analysis shows that due to inclusion of spatial heterogeneity in the population and the asynchronous timing of the epidemic across different areas, the severity of the epidemic might be lower than expected from other models. We find that one of the most crucial control parameters that may significantly reduce the severity of the epidemic is the degree of separation of vulnerable people and people aged 70 years and over, but note also that isolation of other groups has an effect on the severity of the epidemic. It is important to remember that models are there to advise and not to replace reality, and that any action should be coordinated and approved by public health experts with experience in dealing with epidemics. The computational approach makes it possible for further extensive scenario-based analysis to be undertaken. This and a comprehensive study of sensitivity of the model to different parameters defining COVID-19 and its development will be the subject of our forthcoming paper. In that paper, we shall also extend the model where we will consider different probabilistic scenarios for infected people with mild and severe cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhigljavsky, Anatoly; Noonan, Jack","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9fcab49021565e1fbb3e6bfb5c3f1477f335a3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053462","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different parameters","stochastic model","different probabilistic scenarios","different scenarios relevant","different possible scenarios","different areas","severity","SIR-based models","susceptibility of different age groups","Coronavirus COVID","crucial control parameters","flexible modelling approach","computational approach","standard SIR-type models","infected people","vulnerable people","probabilistic nature of contagion","population members","robust modelling","computational nature","situation","insights","UK","extensive scenario-based analysis","inclusion of spatial heterogeneity","parameter sensitivity","relevant sources","widespread contagion","spatial constraints","associated uncertainty","inherent uncertainty","forthcoming paper","fixed cycle of susceptibility","comprehensive study of sensitivity","average","factors","agreement","infection","mitigation","mean field","influence","degree of separation","asynchronous timing","number of key variables","small changes","experience","medical pre-histories","severe cases","communities","recovery","regions","accuracy","effect","respect","public health experts","subject","years","policy","spreads","scarcity of verified data","epidemics","ease","potential","isolation","convention","social contact","outbreak","development","extreme caution","reality","action"],"language":"en"},

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality. Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (\u03B11-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the \u03B11-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice, and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying \u03B11-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS. As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic, preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges, secondary cytokine dysregulation, and mortality. To investigate a potential role for \u03B11-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 13,125 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 655 patients (5.0%) were prescribed \u03B11-AR antagonists in the previous year. Applying logistic regression models, we found that patients with prior use of \u03B11-AR antagonists had lower odds of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.019). Perhaps more importantly, those patients had a ~36% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.34-0.95, p=0.042). By contrast, prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor (\u03B2-AR) antagonists was not correlated with either outcome. We extended these analyses to patients admitted with pneumonia. Of 108,956 subjects in this cohort, 5,498 patients (5.0%) were taking \u03B11-AR antagonist. Similar to ARDS, patients with pneumonia on \u03B11-AR antagonists (but no \u03B2-AR antagonists) had a lower odds of mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p\u003C0.001) and of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.014) compared to non-users. Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these data support a clinical rationale to study \u03B11-AR antagonists in the prevention of severe complications of pneumonia, ARDS, and COVID-19. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of alpha-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms are needed to assess their efficacy in preventing CSS and reducing mortality in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konig, Maximilian F; Powell, Mike; Staedtke, Verena; Bai, Ren-Yuan; Thomas, David L; Fischer, Nicole; Huq, Sakibul; Khalafallah, Adham M; Koenecke, Allison; Xiong, Ruoxuan; Mensh, Brett; Papadopoulos, Nickolas; Kinzler, Kenneth W; Vogelstein, Bert; Vogelstein, Joshua T; Athey, Susan; Zhou, Shibin; Bettegowda, Chetan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3904118ee41cd2e9a5b086e4cc08d6e2682ce631.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051565","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","CSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study \u03B11-AR antagonists","prescribed \u03B11-AR antagonists","\u03B2-AR antagonists","ARDS","\u03B11-AR antagonist prazosin","receptor antagonists","hospital mortality","prophylaxis of patients","predictors of COVID","subset of COVID","prior use of \u03B11","excessive mortality","CSS","retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients","mortality of Coronavirus disease","clinical rationale","hospital capacity","lower odds of mechanical ventilation","lower odds of invasive mechanical ventilation","prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor","cytokine responses","pre-clinical models","cytokine storm syndrome","Catecholamines","prazosin of individuals","severity","SARS-CoV","lower incidence","non-users","randomized clinical trials of alpha","prevention of severe complications of pneumonia","secondary cytokine dysregulation","immune cells","catecholamine surges","various hyper-inflammatory stimuli","inflammatory injury","production of IL","Mirroring findings","hyper-inflammation","dysregulated immune response","logistic regression models","onset of severe symptoms","Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis","acute respiratory distress syndrome","self-amplifying feed-forward loop","increased survival","preventative approaches","pandemic","Truven Health MarketScan Research Database","poor outcomes","cytokines","mice","interleukin","levels","contrast","potential role","high infection rates","previous year","development","efficacy","Emerging evidence","treatment","age","subjects","cohort","analyses"],"language":"en"},

In order to understand this spreading, we investigate a stochastic epidemic model using a metapopulation approach. Simulations are supplied with real data for mobility, demography, and confirmed cases of COVID-19 extracted from public sources. Contagion follows a compartmental epidemic model for each municipality which, in turn, interact with each other through recurrent mobility. Considering the number of municipalities with confirmed COVID-19 cases, simulations can infer the level of mitigation (strong, moderate, or none) that each state is effectively adopting. Properties of the epidemics curves such as time and value of epidemic peak and outbreak duration have very broad distributions across different geographical locations. This outbreak variability is observed in several scales from state, passing through intermediate and immediate up to municipality levels. The epidemic waves start from several foci concentrated in highly populated regions and propagate towards countryside. Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and distance from the respective capital cities are strong in several states, showing propagation towards the countryside, and weak in others, signaling strong influences of multiple centers, not necessarily within the same state. Our take home message is that the responses of different regions to a same mitigation protocol can vary enormously such that the policies of combat to COVID-19, such as quarantine or lockdown, must be engineered according to the region specificity but integrated with the overall situation. Even though we considered a single case of study, we believe that these ideas can be generalized to other countries with mainland scales and heterogeneous demographic distributions.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa, G.

A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model. Method one based on curve fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be on 19th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method two based on SIR Model estimated that the peak will be on 20th - 31st May 2020 if Movement Contro (MCO) is in place with an estimation of 630,000 to 800,000 infected persons. Method three based on System Dynamic Model estimated that the peak will be on 17th May 2020 with an estimation of 22,421 infected persons. Forecasts from each of model suggested the epidemic may peak between middle of April to end of May 2020.

At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia.

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two \u0060\u0060zero\u0022 points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two \u0060\u0060zero\u0022 points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results. Results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huiwen; Zhang, Yanwen; Lu, Shan; Wang, Shanshan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0cfc82dc5230a93b4af3fe3a60f2462f35ebe5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of daily confirmed cases","number of patients","early-outbreak","time","mainland China","early stage","Hubei Province","epidemic trends","alleviation of epidemic","COVID","prediction results","meaningful milepost moments","extent of epidemic spread","important turning points","China Centers","new unknown infectious disease","Disease Control","process","forecasting procedure","effectiveness","paper","hospital","proposed procedure","unknown infectious diseases","public available data","outbreaks of new","important question","government control","precise prediction","flexible framework","general understanding","CDC","days","reasonable assumption","counties","real world situations","people","tracking","future","periods","novel coronavirus","reveal","iconic indicators","model","death","development","global attention","Background","Method"],"language":"en"},

The disagreement results, in part, from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 detected at a single point. Review questions: 1. Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre-symptomatic? Methods: Rapid living systematic review (protocol https://osf.io/9ewys/). We searched Pubmed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a living evidence database of SARS-CoV-2 literature on 25.03.2020. We included studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up and modelling studies. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment were done by one reviewer and verified by a second, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. We used a common-effect model to synthesise proportions from comparable studies. Results: We screened 89 studies and included 11. We estimated an upper bound for the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections of 29% (95% confidence interval 23 to 37%) in eight studies. Selection bias and likely publication bias affected the family case investigation studies. One statistical modelling study estimated the true proportion of asymptomatic infections at 18% (95% credibility interval 16 to 20%). Estimates of the proportions of pre-symptomatic individual in four studies were too heterogeneous to combine. In modelling studies, 40-60% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are the result of transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals, with a smaller contribution from asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: An intermediate contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing tracing and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed. The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buitrago-Garcia, D.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Healthcare workers around the world utilize N95 masks to protect themselves and their patients, yet during this global pandemic they are forced to re-wear what is intended to be single-use masks. This poses significant risk to these healthcare workers along with the populations they are trying to protect. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been validated previously as a way to effectively sterilize these masks between use, however, not all facilities have access to the high cost commercial UV-C lamp sterilization equipment. However, UV-C bulbs are sitting idle in biosafety cabinets (BSCs) at universities and research facilities around the globe that have been shuttered to slow the spread of COVID-19. These bulbs may also be available in existing medical centers where infectious diseases are commonly treated. Therefore, we have developed a method to modify existing light fixtures, or create custom light fixtures compatible with new or existing common UV-C bulbs. This system is scalable and can be created for less than 50 US dollars, on site, at the point of need, and leverages resources that are currently untapped and sitting unused in public and private research facilities. The freely-accessible design can be easily modified for use around the world. Hospitals can obtain this potentially life-saving UVGI resource with minimal funds, via collaboration between research facilities to obtain the UV-C meters and limited availability UVGI bulbs.

Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: \u003E80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brand, Samuel P C; Aziza, Rabia; Kombe, Ivy K; Agoti, Charles N; Hilton, Joe; Rock, Kat S; Parisi, Andrea; Nokes, D James; Keeling, Matt; Barasa, Edwine","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69a305813b49f0445c26970302a60731745798ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059865","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["KenyaCoV","Kenya","China"],"keyphrases":["Kenya range","age distribution of confirmed COVID","person transmission","significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID","epidemic curve","growing epidemic","age distribution of cases","age-specific rate of developing COVID","age groups","slow transmission","transmission scenario","SARS-CoV","KenyaCoV","reproductive number estimates","risk of epidemic rebound","median estimates","combination of published estimates","estimates of age group social interaction rates specific","observed growth rate","Kenyan census","different Kenyan regions","potential incidence rate","Kenyan setting","China","asymptomatic infected individuals","scenarios","basic reproductive number","defined regions","high percentage","case isolation","Exceptional social distancing measures","combination of human mobility data","symptoms","analysis","demographic","accounting","geographic dissimilarities","population","infection","Key epidemiological characteristics","modelling framework","restrictions","magnitude","role of subclinical","forecasts","Chinese outbreak","Methods","months"],"language":"en"},

Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Kai; Wang, Lingwei; Li, Furong; Chen, Dandan; Li, Xi; Qiu, Chen; Chen, Rongchang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d75c48f51b2a5c26a41fe615339e5947d5e9cb30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028555","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan","Hubei","Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["Shenzhen city","confirmed cases","Early identification of imported cases","early identification of COVID","early case of COVID","epidemic of COVID","diagnosed COVID","daily new cases","number of familial clustering cases","implementation of early preventive strategies","peak date of cases arrival","preventive measures","series of early preventive strategies","epidemiological characteristics of COVID","successful control of outbreak","main hospitals","number of patients","decline phase","high mobility city","high population density","hospital setting","designated hospital","strict infection control procedure","medical care","fever","nosocomial infection","nearby province of Hubei","phases","Wuhan","slow increase phase","plateau phase","high proportion of external population","entrances of main traffic","situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease","days isolated observation","prevention of family clustering transmission","medical staff","community transmission","care of suspected","Protection procedure","rapid increase","Observation wards","throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus","detection of body temperature","public area","Chest CT","buildings","outpatients service","admission","order","screening","subjects","blood lymphocyte","potential link","risk","provinces","conclusion","cities","China","countries"],"language":"en"},

However, their central role in media, official reports and decision-making may be undeserved and misleading. Previously published Infection Fatality Rates were weighted by age structure in the 50 countries with more reported deaths to obtain country-specific rates. For each country, the number of infections up to the Infection Date (23 days ago = Incubation Period \u002B Onset to Death period) and the present percentage of immune population were estimated using Infection Fatality Rate, the number of reported deaths (which is less prone to undersampling), and projecting back to Infection Date. We then estimated a Detection Index for each country as the percentage of estimated infections that confirmed cases represent. Assuming that detection remains constant after Infection Date, we estimated the number of deaths and the estimated percentage of the population of each country expected to be immune up to 23 days into the future. Estimated Infection Fatality Rates are higher in Europe. In most countries, confirmed cases currently represent less than 30% of estimated infections on Infection Date, and this value decreases with time. Countries with flat curves throughout the pandemic show the lowest immunity percentages and these values seem unlikely to change in the near future, suggesting that they remain vulnerable to new outbreaks. Estimates for some countries with low Infection Fatality Rates suggest a still steep increase in the number of casualties in the next three weeks. Countries that did not control initial outbreaks seem to have reached higher immunity percentages, although mostly still under 5%. We provide the code to monitor the trajectories of these estimates in 178 countries throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Macias-Ordonez, R.; Villasenor-Amador, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13e4e1e7752c6bdeff6894545dafe7030d74651f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20107516v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infection Date"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Infection Date","countries","Estimated Infection Fatality Rates","estimated percentage","low Infection Fatality Rates","percentage of estimated infections","published Infection Fatality Rates","number of deaths","number of infections","country-specific rates","pandemic","number of reported deaths","number of casualties","present percentage of immune population","higher immunity percentages","days","Estimates","cases","lowest immunity percentages","Confirmed Case Data","Death period","Incubation Period","initial outbreaks","new outbreaks","current COVID","Detection Index","near future","official reports","steep increase","decision-making","media","Onset","age structure","central role","spread","values","projecting","value decreases","Europe","SARS-CoV","flat curves","trajectories","virus","undersampling","time","code","weeks"],"language":"en"},

This has put an enormous demand on medical professionals. Increased wait times in the ED increases the risk of infection transmission. In this work we present an open-source, low cost, off-body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ED based on widely available hardware. The system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection - fever and cyanosis. The use of visible and far-infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1m distance, thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals. Its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non-emergency times as well to reduce wait time, channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks and also prioritize severe cases. Our system consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, a Google Coral USB accelerator, a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 and a FLIR Lepton 3.5 Radiometry Long-Wave Infrared Camera with an associated IO module. Algorithms running in real-time detect the presence and body parts of individual(s) in view, and segments out the forehead and lip regions using PoseNet. The temperature of the forehead-eye area is estimated from the infrared camera image and cyanosis is assessed from the image of the lips in the visible spectrum. In our preliminary experiments, an accuracy of 97% was achieved for detecting fever and 77% for the detection of cyanosis, with a sensitivity of 91% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Although preliminary results are promising, we note that the entire system needs to be optimized before use and assessed for efficacy. The use of low-cost instrumentation will not produce temperature readings and identification of cyanosis that is acceptable in many situations. For this reason, we are releasing the full code stack and system design to allow others to rapidly iterate and improve the system. This may be of particular benefit in low-resource settings, and low-to-middle income countries in particular, which are just beginning to be affected by COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hegde, C.; Suresha, P.

Are there ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in humans? If so, then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods? These were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans. Virologists, ecologists and computational biologists from academia, federal government and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts, vectors and reservoirs. This workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability. Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps. To answer the question of where to look, prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents, arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed. Finally, opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps. Taken together, these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps.","publish_time":"2011-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flanagan, M.

There continue to be sporadic flare-ups of EVD cases in West Africa. EVD presentation is nonspecific and characterized initially by onset of fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and fever; this is followed several days later by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Anorexia and gastrointestinal losses lead to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis, and, in some patients, acute kidney injury. Hypoxia and ventilation failure occurs most often with severe illness and may be exacerbated by substantial fluid requirements for intravascular volume repletion and some degree of systemic capillary leak. Although minor bleeding manifestations are common, hypovolemic and septic shock complicated by multisystem organ dysfunction appear the most frequent causes of death. Males and females have been equally affected, with children (0\u201314 years of age) accounting for 19 %, young adults (15\u201344 years) 58 %, and older adults (\u226545 years) 23 % of reported cases. While the current case fatality proportion in West Africa is approximately 40 %, it has varied substantially over time (highest near the outbreak onset) according to available resources (40\u201390 % mortality in West Africa compared to under 20 % in Western Europe and the USA), by age (near universal among neonates and high among older adults), and by Ebola viral load at admission. While there is no Ebola virus-specific therapy proven to be effective in clinical trials, mortality has been dramatically lower among EVD patients managed with supportive intensive care in highly resourced settings, allowing for the avoidance of hypovolemia, correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and the provision of oxygen, ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis when indicated. This experience emphasizes that, in addition to evaluating specific medical treatments, improving the global capacity to provide supportive critical care to patients with EVD may be the greatest opportunity to improve patient outcomes.

In the coleoid cephalopods, a lens with a graded refractive index provides good vision and is required for survival. Cephalopod S-crystallin is thought to have evolved from glutathione S-transferase (GST) with various homologs differentially expressed in the lens. However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-\u00C5 crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We\u2019ve also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a \u201CGST-like\u201D S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-\u03C3, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Wei-Hung; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Liu, Yu-Tung; Wu, Cheng-Guo; Lin, Min-Han; Chen, Chiao-Che; Lin, Chao-Hsiung; Chou, Chi-Yuan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bf72671f78524129acb86ceef6c598e10c7daa7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4976375.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976375/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-crystallin mutant","Cephalopod S-crystallin","evolution of S","glutathione S-transferase","biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin","lens protein","GST-\u03C3","GST enzymatic activity","lens evolution","glutathione binding","glutathione complex","Protein stability studies","enzyme activity","refractive properties","graded refractive index","direct structural information","Octopus vulgaris","active-site architecture","important functions","good vision","animal lenses","major driving force","various homologs","\u00C5 crystal structure","aggregation","preference","contrasts","tradeoff","mechanisms","coleoid cephalopods","historical mutations","Crystallins","survival","protection"],"language":"en"},

In rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), adverse cardiac remodelling occurs despite elevated cardiac ACE2 activity. We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1\u20137 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1\u20137 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels. As in vitro studies showed no direct effect of DIZE on ACE2 or ACE activity, the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains to be determined.","publish_time":"2016-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Velkoska, Elena; Patel, Sheila K.; Griggs, Karen; Burrell, Louise M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebf25663cfe4314966c86a48ba4ce6a04a435760.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5003360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozgx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II","Ang"],"organizations":["DIZE","LVH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cardiac Ang","cardiac fibrosis","increased cardiac ACE","elevated cardiac ACE2 activity","cardiac RAS balance","adverse cardiac remodelling","beneficial cardiac effects","Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17","ACE activity","direct effect of DIZE","reduced ACE","STNx rats","protective effect","target effect","levels","weeks of subcutaneous DIZE","improved diastolic dysfunction","blood pressure","reduction","reduced ADAM17 mRNA","improved kidney function","renin angiotensin system","pathological condition of kidney injury","cardioprotective profile","fall","ventricular hypertrophy","heart","negative regulator","precise mechanism of action","subtotal nephrectomy","hypertension","LVH","results","role","studies","change","diminazene aceturate","conclusion","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

Since oncogene expression could often modulate sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, we wanted to examine if N-myc expression status would determine virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that induction of exogenous N-myc in a non-N-myc-amplified cell line background (TET-21N) increased susceptibility to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (mutant VSV\u0394M51) and alleviated the type I IFN-induced antiviral state. Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSV\u0394M51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFN-stimulated antiviral state.

Here using a recombinant virus encoding a NS1B protein defective in ISG15 binding, we show that NS1B counteracts ISGylation-mediated antiviral activity by binding and sequestering ISGylated viral proteins, primarily ISGylated viral nucleoprotein (NP), in infected cells. ISGylated NP that is not sequestered by mutant NS1B acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of oligomerization of the more abundant unconjugated NP.

Some have advised that a blood ion level \u003E7 \u00B5g/L indicates potential for ARMDs. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of metal ion testing for ARMDs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify articles from which it was possible to reconstruct a 2 \u00D7 2 table. Two readers independently reviewed all articles and extracted data using explicit criteria. We computed a summary receiver operating curve using a Bayesian random-effects hierarchical model. RESULTS: Our literature search returned 575 unique articles; only six met inclusion criteria defined a priori. The discriminative capacity of ion tests was homogeneous across studies but that there was substantial cut-point heterogeneity. Our best estimate of the \u201Ctrue\u201D area under curve (AUC) for metal ion testing is 0.615, with a 95% credible interval of 0.480 to 0.735, thus we can state that the probability that metal ion testing is actually clinically useful with an AUC \u2265 0.75 is 1.7%. CONCLUSION: Metal ion levels are not useful as a screening test for identifying high risk patients because ion testing will either lead to a large burden of false positive patients, or otherwise marginally modify the pre-test probability. With the availability of more accurate non-invasive tests, we did not find any evidence for using blood ion levels to diagnose symptomatic patients. Cite this article: M. Pahuta, J. M. Smolders, J.

These viruses express envelope glycoproteins that are singularly important during the infection of host cells by mediating fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes. Despite low homology at protein levels, three classes of viral fusion proteins have, as of yet, been identified based on structural similarities. Their incorporation into viral particles is dependent upon their proper sub-cellular localization after being expressed and folded properly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, viral protein expression can cause stress in the ER, and host cells respond to alleviate the ER stress in the form of the unfolded protein response (UPR); the effects of which have been observed to potentiate or inhibit viral infection. One important arm of UPR is to elevate the capacity of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is comprised of host quality control machinery that ensures proper protein folding. In this review, we provide relevant details regarding viral envelope glycoproteins, UPR, ERAD, and their interactions in host cells.","publish_time":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frabutt, Dylan A.; Zheng, Yong-Hui","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8befe1b5905e502b127ae478f3b9de1d6e25e317.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral protein expression","viral infection","viral envelope glycoproteins","viral particles","infection of host cells","protein levels","ER stress","ER-associated protein degradation","proper protein folding","classes of viral fusion proteins","unfolded protein response","host cell membranes","ERAD","host quality control machinery","viruses express envelope glycoproteins","important arm of UPR","Enveloped viruses","proper sub-cellular localization","significant category of pathogens","relevant details","form","pathway","serious diseases","capacity","interactions","low homology","animals","incorporation","review","effects","endoplasmic reticulum","structural similarities"],"language":"en"},

To address these gaps in our knowledge, we leveraged a nonhuman primate model of VZV infection where rhesus macaques are intrabronchially challenged with the closely related Simian Varicella Virus (SVV). Acute infection is characterized by immune infiltration of the lung airways, a significant up-regulation of genes involved in antiviral-immunity, and a down-regulation of genes involved in lung development. This is followed by a decrease in viral loads and increased expression of genes associated with cell cycle and tissue repair. These data provide the first characterization of the host response required to control varicella virus replication in the lung and provide insight into mechanisms by which VZV infection can cause lung injury in an immune competent host.","publish_time":"2016-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arnold, Nicole; Girke, Thomas; Sureshchandra, Suhas; Nguyen, Christina; Rais, Maham; Messaoudi, Ilhem","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edd3e8db7f89f93c6a91f5546c1c5a8354f58abe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5039758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Varicella"],"organizations":["VZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute VZV infection","Acute infection","Varicella Zoster Virus","varicella virus replication","Simian Varicella Virus","lung injury","lung airways","regulation of genes","lung development","nonhuman primate model of VZV infection","host response","immune competent host","causative agent of varicella","increased expression of genes","host-pathogen interactions","immune infiltration","herpes zoster","cell cycle","viral loads","insight","respiratory route","rhesus macaques","decrease","lungs","mechanisms","limited access","tissue repair","clinical samples","knowledge","characterization","antiviral-immunity","SVV","gaps","data"],"language":"en"},

These bacteria still are of great importance, but continuously increasing herd sizes have complicated the scenario and the influence of secondary invaders may have been increased. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of A. pleuropneumoniae and M. hyopneumoniae, as well as that of the secondary invaders Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis by serology in four pig herds (A\u2013D) using age segregated rearing systems with high incidences of pleuritic lesions at slaughter. RESULTS: Pleuritic lesions registered at slaughter ranged from 20.5 to 33.1 % in the four herds. In herd A, the levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae exceeded A(450) \u003E 1.5, but not to any other microbe searched for. The seroconversion took place early during the fattening period. Similar levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae were also recorded in herd B, with a subsequent increase in levels of antibodies to P. multocida. Pigs seroconverted to both agents during the early phase of the fattening period. In herd C, pigs seroconverted to P. multocida during the early phase of the fattening period and thereafter to A. pleuropneumoniae. In herd D, the levels of antibodies to P. multocida exceeded A(450) \u003E 1.0 in absence (A(450) \u003C 0.5) of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae. The levels of serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae and to S. suis remained below A(450) \u003C 1.0 in all four herds. Pigs seroconverted to M. hyopneumoniae late during the rearing period (herd B\u2013D), or not at all (herd A). CONCLUSION: Different serological patterns were found in the four herds with high levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae and P. multocida, either alone or in combination with each other. Seroconversion to M. hyopneumoniae late during the rearing period or not at all, confirmed the positive effect of age segregated rearing in preventing or delaying infections with M. hyopneumoniae.

Acute inflammation is an essential element of host defense against infection, but can be damaging to the host when left unchecked. Effective host defense requires multiple lipid mediators, which collectively have proinflammatory and/or proresolving effects on the lung. During pulmonary infections, phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol can be chemically and enzymatically oxidized, as well as truncated and modified, producing complex mixtures of bioactive lipids. We review recent evidence that phospholipids and cholesterol and their derivatives regulate pulmonary innate and adaptive immunity during infection. We first highlight data that oxidized phospholipids generated in the lung during infection stimulate pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs and scavenger receptors, thereby amplifying the pulmonary inflammatory response. Next, we discuss evidence that oxidation of endogenous pools of cholesterol during pulmonary infections produces oxysterols that also modify the function of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Last, we conclude with data that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, both in the form of phospholipid acyl chains and through enzymatic processing into endogenous proresolving lipid mediators, aid in the resolution of lung inflammation through distinct mechanisms. Unraveling the complex mechanisms of induction and function of distinct classes of bioactive lipids, both native and modified, may hold promise for developing new therapeutic strategies for improving pulmonary outcomes in response to infection.","publish_time":"2016-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaikh, Saame Raza; Fessler, Michael B.; Gowdy, Kymberly M.","journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/421302dc5df774ef449768c48227b45b1640d775.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5069085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5069085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary infections","pulmonary outcomes","pulmonary inflammatory response","endogenous proresolving lipid mediators","resolution of lung inflammation","distinct mechanisms","Effective host defense","phospholipids","data","function of distinct classes of bioactive lipids","oxidation of endogenous pools of cholesterol","form of phospholipid acyl chains","essential element of host defense","complex mixtures of bioactive lipids","multiple lipid mediators","complex mechanisms of induction","viral respiratory tract infections","scavenger receptors","adaptive immunity","Acute inflammation","proresolving effects","recent evidence","pattern recognition receptors","adaptive immune cells","enzymatic processing","aid","derivatives","TLRs","millions of deaths","polyunsaturated fatty acids","new therapeutic strategies","proinflammatory","oxysterols","leading cause of death"],"language":"en"},

In this commentary, a set of seven specific and concrete actions are proposed to directly address these issues and to accelerate P. falciparum elimination within the Greater Mekong Subregion to avert a wider public health crisis. These actions are specifically needed to elevate the situation and response mechanisms to those of a true emergency; to address systems-level challenges with personnel limitations and stock-outs of key commodities; and to restructure the response mechanisms to be well-aligned with the required outcomes. Consideration of these issues is especially pressing with planning meetings for renewal of the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI) framework slated for late 2016 and into 2017, but these suggestions are also relevant for malaria programmes globally.","publish_time":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lover, Andrew A.; Gosling, Roly; Feachem, Richard; Tulloch, Jim","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13fdfe26f33c4b7a267d3a00e64dec1eb5fe84e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5073706.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5073706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["falciparum elimination","health systems-level challenges","response mechanisms","issues","Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant","malaria control","malaria programmes","concrete actions","decades of global progress","Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative","artemisinin-based combination therapy","wider public health crisis","primary therapies","personnel limitations","RAI","stock-outs","use","Greater Mekong Subregion","renewal","multiple sets of initiatives","Southeast Asia","planning meetings","framework","key commodities","partners","date","true emergency","wide range of organizational","required outcomes","suggestions","emergence","commentary","situation","Consideration"],"language":"en"},

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The histopathology of concurrent, but often subclinical, inflammatory processes in the small intestine, liver, and pancreas of cats is poorly described. We aimed to investigate the frequency of enteritis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, or some combination of these in symptomatic and asymptomatic cats, compare clinicopathological features, and correlate histopathological with laboratory findings. ANIMALS: Domestic cats (27 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic, and 8 normal). METHODS: Prospective study. Physical examination, laboratory variables (CBC, serum biochemistry profile, serum thyroxine concentration, serum feline trypsin\u2010like immunoreactivity [fTLI], feline lipase immunoreactivity [fPLI, as measured by Spec fPL (\u00AE)], urinalysis, and fecal analysis), imaging, and histopathological examinations were conducted. Feline liver, pancreas, and small intestine were biopsied during laparotomy. RESULTS: Inflammatory lesions were detected in 47 cats (27 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic). In total, 20 cats had histopathologic lesions of IBD (13/47, 27.7%), cholangitis (6/47, 12.8%), or pancreatitis (1/47, 2.1%) alone, or inflammation involving \u003E1 organ (27/47, 57.4%). More specifically, 16/47 cats (34.0%) had concurrent lesions of IBD and cholangitis, 3/47 (6.4%) of IBD and pancreatitis, and 8/47 cats (17%) of triaditis. Triaditis was identified only in symptomatic cats (8/27, 29.6%).

We thus aimed to understand the interaction of viral infections and the nasal microbiota in early life to appraise their roles in disease development. Thirty-two healthy, unselected infants were included in this prospective longitudinal cohort study within the first year of life. Biweekly nasal swabs (n = 559) were taken, and the microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and 10 different viruses and 2 atypical bacteria were characterized by real-time PCR (combination of seven duplex samples). In contrast to asymptomatic human rhinovirus (HRV) colonization, symptomatic HRV infections were associated with lower alpha diversity (Shannon diversity index [SDI]), higher bacterial density (PCR concentration), and a difference in beta diversities (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis index) of the microbiota. In addition, infants with more frequent HRV infections had a lower SDI at the end of the study period. Overall, changes in the microbiota associated with symptomatic HRV infections were characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. The interaction between HRV infections and the nasal microbiota in early life might be of importance for later disease development and indicate a potential approach for future interventions. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viral infections are very frequent in infancy and of importance in acute and chronic disease development. Infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) are, e.g., associated with the later development of asthma. We found that only symptomatic HRV infections were associated with acute changes in the nasal microbiota, mainly characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. Infants with more frequent symptomatic HRV infections had a lower bacterial diversity at the end of the first year of life. Whether the interaction between viruses and the microbiota is one pathway contributing to asthma development will be assessed in the follow-ups of these children. Independent of that, measurements of microbial diversity might represent a potential marker for risk of later lung disease or monitoring of early life interventions.","publish_time":"2016-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korten, Insa; Mika, Moana; Klenja, Shkipe; Kieninger, Elisabeth; Mack, Ines; Barbani, Maria Teresa; Gorgievski, Meri; Frey, Urs; Hilty, Markus; Latzin, Philipp","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94ccf97f5df377bf432fa3a831e38f11985965bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5120172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bray-Curtis","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frequent HRV infections","frequent symptomatic HRV infections","nasal microbiota","interaction of viral infections","microbiota composition","IMPORTANCE Respiratory viral infections","lower bacterial diversity","later disease development","loss of microbial diversity","year of life","asthma development","lower alpha diversity","chronic disease development","early life interventions","measurements of microbial diversity","later development of asthma","Shannon diversity index","influence of viral colonization","increased bacterial colonization","lower SDI","risk of later lung disease","end","acute changes","Biweekly nasal swabs","unselected infants","higher bacterial density","asymptomatic human rhinovirus","potential marker","potential approach","real-time PCR","PCR concentration","different viruses","study period","future interventions","Bray-Curtis index","prospective longitudinal cohort study","Jaccard","difference","atypical bacteria","infancy","beta diversities","S rRNA pyrosequencing","combination","Traditional culture techniques","contrast","pathway","roles","duplex samples","addition","follow-ups","children"],"language":"en"},

In this report, the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of SM934 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was investigated using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. We demonstrated that SM934 treatment alleviate the severity of arthritis in CIA mice with established manifestations. The therapeutic benefits were associated with ameliorated joint swelling and reduced extent of bone erosion and destruction. Further, administration of SM934 diminished the development of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Th17 cells and suppressed the production of pathogenic antibodies, without altering the proportion of germinal center B cells. Ex vivo, SM934 treatment inhibited the bovine type II collagen (CII) induced proliferation and inflammatory cytokines secretion of CII -reactive T cells. In vitro, SM934 impeded the polarization of na\u00EFve CD4(\u002B) T cells into Tfh cells and the expression of its transcript factor Bcl-6. Moreover, SM934 decreased the IL-21-producing CD4(\u002B) T cells and dampened the IL-21 downstream signaling through STAT3. These finding offered the convincing evidence that artemisinin derivative might attenuate RA by simultaneously interfering with the generation of Tfh cells and Th17 cells as well as the subsequent antibody-mediated immune responses.","publish_time":"2016-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Ze-Min; Yang, Xiao-Qian; Zhu, Feng-Hua; He, Shi-Jun; Tang, Wei; Zuo, Jian-Ping","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbf232152712b5e379797c6b0008bb7926001bb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5126690.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIA","RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Th17 cells","reactive T cells","SM934 treatment","generation of Tfh cells","administration of SM934","underlying mechanisms of SM934","proportion of germinal center B cells","CIA mice","collagen-induced arthritis","rheumatoid arthritis","severity of arthritis","therapeutic efficacy","therapeutic benefits","autoimmune mice","J mice","IL","development of T follicular helper","potent therapeutic activity","artemisinin analogue","artemisinin derivative","polarization of na\u00EFve CD4","inflammatory cytokines secretion of CII","lupus","immunosuppressive properties","ameliorated joint swelling","reduced extent of bone erosion","proliferation","expression","diseases","DBA","bovine type","convincing evidence","subsequent antibody","destruction","established manifestations","production of pathogenic antibodies","transcript factor Bcl","immune responses","finding","report","STAT3"],"language":"en"},

The present study was undertaken to evaluate chikungunya virus (CHIKV) proteins for RNAi suppressor activity. We systematically analyzed all nine CHIKV proteins for RNAi suppressor activity using Sf21 RNAi sensor cell line based assay. Two non-structural proteins, namely, nsP2 and nsP3 were found to exhibit RNAi suppressor activity. We further validated the findings in natural hosts, namely in Aedes and in mammalian cell lines and further through EMSA and Agrobacterium infiltration in GFP silenced transgenic tobacco plants. Domains responsible for maximum RNAi suppressor activity were also identified within these proteins. RNA binding motifs in these domains were identified and their participation in RNAi suppression evaluated using site directed mutagenesis. Sequence alignment of these motifs across all species of known alphaviruses revealed conservation of these motifs emphasizing on a similar role of action in other species of alphaviruses as well.

During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this data-driven method can help to effectively control emerging infections.","publish_time":"2016-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Backer, Jantien A.; Wallinga, Jacco","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a5bfccbd47694771018f0ee03b0eeedfeeb2ef9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5145133.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Liberia","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["data-driven method","spatiotemporal analysis method","available longitudinal incidence data","local model","local epidemics","good quality data","contribution of local","probable cases","imported cases","infected cases","sensitivity analysis","spatiotemporal resolution","countries","estimated effective reproduction numbers","longest Ebola epidemic","extent of spatial spread","different roles","spatial dispersion","increasing resolution","different geographical locations","gravity-type model","West Africa","Liberia","cross-border transmissions","Sierra Leone","time","sources of introductions","discovery","probability","weekly incidences","uninfected areas","Guinea","small percentage","World Health Organization","minority","virus","simulations","districts","emerging infections","migrants","results","country","underreporting"],"language":"en"},

By virtue of this method, we can explain the evolutionary relationships, but further explanations are not possible unless sequences are studied through the chemical nature of individual amino acids. Here we develop a new methodology to characterize the protein sequences on the basis of the chemical nature of the amino acids. We design various algorithms for studying the variation of chemical group transitions and various chemical group combinations as patterns in the protein sequences. The amino acid sequence of conventional myosin II head domain of 14 family members are taken to illustrate this new approach. We find two blocks of maximum length 6 aa as \u2018FPKATD\u2019 and \u2018Y/FTNEKL\u2019 without repeating the same chemical nature and one block of maximum length 20 aa with the repetition of chemical nature which are common among all 14 members. We also check commonality with another motor protein sub-family kinesin, KIF1A. Based on our analysis we find a common block of length 8 aa both in myosin II and KIF1A. This motif is located in the neck linker region which could be responsible for the generation of mechanical force, enabling us to find the unique blocks which remain chemically conserved across the family. We also validate our methodology with different protein families such as MYOI, Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), Na(\u002B)/K(\u002B)-ATPase and Ca(2\u002B)-ATPase.

PEDV infection causes lesions and clinical symptoms, and infected pigs often succumb to severe dehydration. If there is not a timely and effective method to control its infection, PEDV will spread rapidly across the whole swine farm. Therefore, preclinical identification of PEDV is of great significance for preventing the outbreak and spread of this disease. In this study, a functionalized nanoparticles-based PCR method (UNDP-PCR) specific for PEDV was developed through systematic optimization of functionalized magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles which were further used to specifically enrich viral RNA from the lysate of PEDV stool samples, forming a MMPs-RNA-AuNPs complex. Then, oligonucleotides specific for PEDV coated on AuNPs were eluted from the complex and were further amplified and characterized by PCR. The detection limitation of the established UNDP-PCR method for PEDV was 25 copies in per gram PEDV stool samples, which is 400-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR for stool samples. The UNDP-PCR for PEDV exhibited reliable reproducibility and high specificity, no cross-reaction was observed with other porcine viruses. In 153 preclinical fecal samples, the positive detection rate of UNDP-PCR specific for PEDV (30.72%) was much higher than that of conventional RT-PCR (5.88%) and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR.

Recent outbreaks have stressed the urgency of effective research on the dynamics of infectious disease spread. However, it is difficult to predict when and where outbreaks may emerge and how infectious diseases spread because many factors affect their transmission, and some of them may be unknown. METHODS: One feasible means to promptly detect an outbreak and track the progress of disease spread is to implement surveillance systems in regional or national health and medical centres. The accumulated surveillance data, including temporal, spatial, clinical, and demographic information can provide valuable information that can be exploited to better understand and model the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The aim of this work is to develop and empirically evaluate a stochastic model that allows the investigation of transmission patterns of infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations. RESULTS: We test the proposed model on simulation data and apply it to the surveillance data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. In the simulation experiment, our model achieves high accuracy in parameter estimation (less than 10.0 % mean absolute percentage error). In terms of the forward prediction of case incidence, the mean absolute percentage errors are 17.3 % for the simulation experiment and 20.0 % for the experiment on the real surveillance data. CONCLUSION: We propose a stochastic model to study the dynamics of infectious disease spread in heterogeneous populations from temporal-spatial surveillance data. The proposed model is evaluated using both simulated data and the real data from the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong and achieves acceptable prediction accuracy. We believe that our model can provide valuable insights for public health authorities to predict the effect of disease spread and analyse its underlying factors and to guide new control efforts.

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal gene amplification technology, has been explored for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, an exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection was developed and validated. Primers targeting specifically the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FHV-1 were designed. The RPA reaction was performed successfully at 39\u00B0C and the results were obtained within 20 min. Using different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA that contains the TK gene as template, we showed the detection limit of exo-RPA was 10(2) copies DNA/reaction, the same as that of real time PCR. The exo-RPA assay did not cross-detect feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus-1, pseudorabies virus or chlamydia psittaci, a panel of pathogens important in feline URTD or other viruses in Alphaherpesvirinae, demonstrating high specificity. The assay was validated by testing 120 nasal and ocular conjunctival swabs of cats, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR. Both assays provided the same testing results in the clinical samples. Compared with real time PCR, the exo-RPA assay uses less-complex equipment that is portable and the reaction is completed much faster. Additionally, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity, suitable for shipment and storage for field tests. Taken together, the exo-RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR, suitable for use in less advanced laboratories and for field detection of FHV-1 infection.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jianchang; Liu, Libing; Wang, Jinfeng; Sun, Xiaoxia; Yuan, Wanzhe","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be050658bf3b654ae5d9cbe62f6198e5c4932a95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5207716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exo-RPA assay","RPA reaction","gene of FHV","real time PCR","field detection of FHV","feline URTD","Feline herpesvirus","commercial RPA reagents","feline calicivirus","feline panleukopenia virus","detection limit of exo","real-time PCR","TK gene","field tests","testing results","polymerase chain reaction","pseudorabies virus","ocular disease","infection","major pathogens of feline upper respiratory tract disease","isothermal gene amplification technology","enveloped dsDNA virus","Recombinase polymerase amplification","advanced laboratories","bovine herpesvirus","well-equipped laboratories","copies DNA","panel of pathogens important","ocular conjunctival swabs of cats","different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA","cost-effective alternative","temperatures","days","loss of activity","vacuum-sealed pouches","viruses","shipment","chlamydia psittaci","gold standard diagnostic tool","room temperature","Alphaherpesvirinae","storage","thymidine kinase","complex equipment","template","molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases","high specificity","clinical samples","study","Primers","assays"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we evaluated the role of the autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) in HCV replication and MW formation. Using a dominant negative form of ATG12 and an siRNA approach, we demonstrated that the ATG5-12 conjugate, but not LC3-II formation, is crucial for efficient viral replication. Furthermore, purification of HCV MW revealed the presence of ATG5-12 and ATG16L1 along with HCV nonstructural proteins. Interestingly, LC3 was not recruited along with the elongation complex to the site of viral replication. Finally, inhibition of the elongation complex, but not LC3, greatly impaired the formation of the wild-type MW phenotype.

This study was designed to investigate the influences of clinical variables and mechanical ventilation settings on the outcomes for severe ARDS patients receiving ECMO. METHODS: We reviewed severe ARDS patients who received ECMO due to refractory hypoxemia from May 2006 to October 2015. Serial mechanical ventilator settings before and after ECMO and factors associated with survival were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 158 severe ARDS patients received ECMO were finally analyzed. Overall intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 55.1%. After ECMO initiation, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure and dynamic driving pressure were decreased, while positive end-expiratory pressure levels were relative maintained. After ECMO initiation, nonsurvivors had significantly higher dynamic driving pressure until day 7 than survivors. Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that immunocompromised [hazard ratio 1.957; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.216\u20133.147; p = 0.006], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (hazard ratio 1.039; 95% CI 1.005\u20131.073; p = 0.023), ARDS duration before ECMO (hazard ratio 1.002; 95% CI 1.000\u20131.003; p = 0.029) and mean dynamic driving pressure from day 1 to 3 on ECMO (hazard ratio 1.070; 95% CI 1.026\u20131.116; p = 0.002) were independently associated with ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: For severe ARDS patients receiving ECMO, immunocompromised status, APACHE II score and the duration of ARDS before ECMO initiation were significantly associated with ICU survival. Higher dynamic driving pressure during first 3 days of ECMO support was also independently associated with increased ICU mortality.","publish_time":"2017-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiu, Li-Chung; Hu, Han-Chung; Hung, Chen-Yiu; Chang, Chih-Hao; Tsai, Feng-Chun; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Huang, Chung-Chi; Wu, Huang-Pin; Kao, Kuo-Chin","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9de840d19b28d26070a655bf6d51732f97a0a3f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5267613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5267613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ECMO","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECMO initiation","severe ARDS patients","days of ECMO support","ARDS duration","duration of ARDS","higher dynamic driving pressure","hazard ratio","CI","ICU survival","peak inspiratory pressure","increased ICU mortality","mechanical ventilation settings","optimal mechanical ventilator settings","Serial mechanical ventilator settings","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","APACHE","positive end-expiratory pressure levels","score","survival predictors","Acute Physiology","immunocompromised status","outcomes","tidal volume","Chronic Health Evaluation","nonsurvivors","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Cox proportional hazards regression model","influences of clinical variables","intensive care unit","total","confidence interval","BACKGROUND","factors","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","refractory hypoxemia","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the relationship between animal age, breed type, and the frequency of Cryptosporidium infections was determined. Fecal samples from 234 lambs and 105 goat kids aged up to 9 weeks, representing 24 breeds and their cross-breeds were collected from 71 small ruminant farms across Poland. The identification of Cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18 SSU ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and COWP loci followed by subtyping of C. parvum and C. hominis strains at GP60 gene locus. The presence of Cryptosporidium DNA at the 18 SSU rRNA locus was detected in 45/234 (19.2%) lamb feces samples and in 39/105 (37.1%) taken from goats. The following Cryptosporidium species: C. xiaoi, C. bovis, C. ubiquitum, C. parvum, and C. hominis were detected in small ruminants. Infections caused by C. xiaoi were predominant without favoring any tested animal species. Subsequent GP60 subtyping revealed the presence of C. parvum IIaA17G1R1 subtype in sheep and IIdA23G1 subtype in goats. IIdA23G1 subtype was detected in a goat host for the first time. There were no significant differences found in frequency of infections between the age groups (\u003C3 and 3\u20139 weeks) of lambs (P = 0.14, \u03B1 \u003E 0.05) or goat kids (P = 0.06, \u03B1 \u003E 0.05). In addition, there was no correlation observed between the frequency in occurrence of particular parasite species and breed type in relation to native sheep breeds (F = 0.11; P = 0.990 \u003E 0.05). In the case of goats, more breed-related differences in parasite occurrence were found.

This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the self-interests of individuals during the spread of a susceptible-infected-susceptible disease. In this model, individuals strategically modify their behavior based on current disease conditions. These reactions influence disease spread. We show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick individuals above which disease is eradicated rapidly. Furthermore, we find that risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. Empathy is more effective than risk-aversion because when infectious individuals change behavior, they reduce all of their potential infections, whereas when healthy individuals change behavior, they reduce only a small portion of potential infections. This imbalance in the role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals on disease eradication affords critical policy insights.","publish_time":"2017-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eksin, Ceyhun; Shamma, Jeff S.; Weitz, Joshua S.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c751c8772ce889d767d8896227d82d3f8f5f3bab.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0234207cba8165f1e1852b92ae0fa0d9e2f870fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5349521.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5349521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Healthy individuals","Sick individuals","susceptible individuals","susceptible disease","self-interests of individuals","infectious individuals","disease eradication","current disease conditions","reactions influence disease spread","preemptive measures","risk averse behavior","stochastic network disease game model","susceptible-infected","protective measures","preemptive changes","empathy","response","risk-aversion","small portion of potential infections","critical policy insights","critical level of concern","paper","practice","costs","epidemic","role","imbalance"],"language":"en"},

HA binds to a virus receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid, on the host cell and mediates virus attachment to the cell surface. The hydrolytic enzyme NA cleaves sialic acid from viral receptors and accelerates the release of progeny virus from host cells. In this study, we identified a novel function of HA and NA as machinery for viral motility. HAs exchanged binding partner receptors iteratively, generating virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface instead of a cell surface. The virus movement was also dependent on NA. Virus movement mediated by HA and NA resulted in a three to four-fold increase in virus internalisation by cultured cells. We concluded that cooperation of HA and NA moves IAV particles on a cell surface and enhances virus infection of host cells.","publish_time":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sakai, Tatsuya; Nishimura, Shin I.; Naito, Tadasuke; Saito, Mineki","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3654aa0ea8709bb844a9dd36d67c4e5d89ba3c83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5366856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5366856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus movement","virus receptor","virus internalisation","virus attachment","virus infection of host cells","determinants of virus infectivity","release of progeny virus","cell surface","cooperation of HA","HA binds","host specificity","hydrolytic enzyme NA","novel function of HA","viral receptors","receptor-coated glass surface","cultured cells","IAV particles","viral motility","binding partner receptors","sialic acid","pathogenicity","transmissibility","membrane proteins hemagglutinin","neuraminidase","machinery","sialoglycolipid","fold increase","sialoglycoprotein","major antigenicity","Influenza","study"],"language":"en"},

Although its influence on cell\u2019s response is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the widest group of transmembrane proteins in animals, which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by the Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors \u2013in full agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels\u2013 and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell interaction.","publish_time":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carotenuto, Angelo R.; Lunghi, Laura; Piccolo, Valentina; Babaei, Mahnoush; Dayal, Kaushik; Pugno, Nicola; Zingales, Massimiliano; Deseri, Luca; Fraldi, Massimiliano","journal":"Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75381011d421a3a5a4a4f01c2dbf74c9044b8733.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002250962030209X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002250962030209X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Adenosine Monophosphate","Multidrug Resistance Proteins"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell membrane","active receptors","active GPCRs","lipid rafts","surrounding lipid membrane","specific cell processes","balance of mass","ligand-binding","lipid ordering","mass balance of species","virus-cell interaction","binding receptors of different types","synergistic balance","better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena","kinetics of binding","MRPs","changes of species densities","trigger rafts formation","mechanical processes","strong coupling","dynamics of transporters","multiphysics approach","cAMP levels","multiscale geometrical changes","Multidrug Resistance Proteins","Abstract Clustering of ligand","widest group of transmembrane proteins","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus","animals","chemical signalling pathways","thickened isles","current scientific debate","mechanobiological aspects","interplay","energetics","COVID","diffusion","cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate","approaches accounting","kinematics","efflux","SARS-CoV","role","G-protein","ascertained fact","intracellular environment","agreement","entry port","linear momentum","space-time evolution","work","viruses","sites","unbinding","remodelling","basis","cell\u2019s response","influence","focus","obtained energy","paper","mechanobiology","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

We combined individual clinical risk predictions with epidemic modelling to examine simulations of isolation and exit policies. Methods: We developed a method to include personalised risk predictions in epidemic models based on data science principles. We extended a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to account for predictions of severity, defined by the risk of an individual needing intensive care in case of infection. We studied example isolation policies using simulations with the risk-extended epidemic model, using COVID-19 data and estimates in France as of mid April 2020 (4 000 patients in ICU, around 7 250 total ICU beds occupied at the peak of the outbreak, 0.5% percent of patients requiring ICU upon infection). We considered scenarios varying in the discrimination performance of a risk prediction model, in the degree of social distancing, and in the severity rate upon infection. Confidence intervals were obtained using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach. The framework may be used with other epidemic models, with other risk predictions, and for other epidemic outbreaks. Findings: Based on the data for France as of mid April 2020, simulations indicated that an exit policy considering clinical risk predictions starting on May 11, as planned by the government, could enable to immediately relax restrictions for an extra 10% (6 700 000 people) or more of the lowest-risk population, and consequently relax the restrictions on the remaining population up to two times (or several months) faster, with only a small proportion of the population remaining in isolation for an extended period of time -- while abiding to the current ICU capacity. In contrast, implementing the same exit policy without risk predictions would exceed the ICU capacity by a multiple. Sensitivity analyses showed that when the assumed percentage of severe patients among the population decreased, or the prediction model discrimination improved, or ICU capacity increased, policies based on risk models had a greater impact on the results of epidemic simulations. At the same time, sensitivity analyses also showed that differential isolation policies require that higher risk individuals comply with recommended restrictions. In general, our simulations showed that risk prediction models could always improve policy effectiveness, keeping everything else constant, in line with value of information arguments, even for models with moderate discrimination power. Interpretation: Clinical risk prediction models should be considered to manage outbreaks using a framework as the one developed. They can inform personalised isolation policies, for example by gradually restricting (relaxing) isolation from the highest (lowest) to the lowest (highest) predicted risk individuals, when such policies are considered. This may lead to both safer and faster outcomes than what can be achieved without such prediction models. They enable personalisation of policies, which are known to improve effectiveness in other non-healthcare contexts.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evgeniou, T.; Fekom, M.; Ovchinnikov, A.; Porcher, R.; Pouchol, C.; Vayatis, N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2aee4fda4b3c2435f0227ad3b7278d26b3ae2762.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.29.20084707v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["risk models","personalised risk predictions","Clinical risk prediction models","lowest-risk population","epidemic models","individual clinical risk predictions","higher risk individuals","simulations of isolation","personalised isolation policies","example isolation policies","differential isolation policies","predictions of severity","results of epidemic simulations","prediction model discrimination","epidemic outbreaks","personalisation of policies","epidemic modelling","ICU capacity increased","current ICU capacity","exit policy","remaining population","total ICU beds","policy effectiveness","discrimination performance","COVID","percent of patients","case of infection","Sensitivity analyses","recommended restrictions","people","France","extended period of time","framework","degree of social distancing","social distancing measures","moderate discrimination power","data science principles","assumed percentage of severe patients","severity rate","relaxing lock","faster outcomes","individual needing intensive care","greater impact","value of information arguments","line","peak","world","estimates","Approximate Bayesian Computation approach","Interpretation","non-healthcare contexts","governments","times","SEIR","Confidence intervals","small proportion","scenarios","contrast","months","Methods","Background","Findings"],"language":"en"},

L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patient\u0027s clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galbadage, T.; Peterson, B.

We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to April 1, 2020. Countries selected for analysis were China, Italy, Spain, Iran, and Brazil. The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China, which is in a late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as of Italy, Spain, and Iran, which supposedly are in the middle of the outbreak at the time of this writing. As for Brazil, which is still in the so-called exponential growth regime, we used the generalized growth model which is more appropriate for such cases. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken.

We propose three contributions: a) ICUBAM (ICU Bed Availability Monitor), a tool which both collects and visualizes information on CCB availability entered directly by intensivists. b) An analysis of CCB availability and ICU admissions and outcomes using collected by ICUBAM during a 6-week period in the hard-hit Grand Est region of France, and c) Explanatory and predictive models adapted to CCB availability prediction, and fitted to availability information collected by ICUBAM. Methods: We interact directly with intensivists twice a day, by sending a SMS with a web link to the ICUBAM form where they enter 8 numbers: number of free and occupied CCBs (ventilator-equipped) for both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19- negative patients, the number of COVID-19 related ICU deaths and discharges, the number of ICU refusals, and the number of patients transferred to another region due to bed shortages. The collected data are described using univariate and multivariate methods such as correspondence analysis and then modeled at different scales: a medium and long term prediction using SEIR models, and a short term statistical model to predict the number of CCBs. Results: ICUBAM was brought online March 25, and is currently being used in the Grand-Est region by 109 intensivists representing 40 ICUs (95% of ICUs). ICUBAM allows for the calculation of CCB availability, admission and discharge statistics. Our analysis of data describes the evolution and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis in the Grand-Est region: on April 6th, at maximum bed capacity, 1056 ventilator-equipped CCBs were present, representing 211% of the nominal regional capacity of 501 beds. From March 19th to March 31st, average daily COVID-19 ICU inflow was 68 patients/day, and 314 critical care patients were transferred out of the Grand-Est region. With French lockdown starting on March 17th, a decrease of the daily inflow was found starting on April 1st: 23 patients/day during the first fortnight of April, and 7 patients/day during the last fortnight. However, treatment time for COVID-19 occupied CCBs is long: 15 days after the peak on March 31st, only 20% of ICU beds have been freed (50% after 1 month). Region-wide COVID-19 related in-ICU mortality is evaluated at 31%. Models trained from ICUBAM data are able to describe and predict the evolution of bed usage for the Grand-Estregion. Conclusion: We observe strong uptake of the ICUBAM tool, amongst both physicians and local healthcare stakeholders (health agencies, first responders etc.). We are able to leverage data collected with ICUBAM to better understand the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Grand Est region. We also present how data ingested by ICUBAM can be used to anticipate CCB shortages and predict future admissions. Most importantly, we demonstrate the importance of having a cross-functional team involving physicians, statisticians and computer scientists working both with first-line medical responders and local health agencies. This allowed us to quickly implement effective tools to assist in critical decision-making processes.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"ICUBAM Consortium,; josse, j.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5178bf3fc24dbe1c1a213b026361a05d57ac2d73.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20091264v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCB","ICU","ICUBAM","SEIR"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["ICUBAM data","number of COVID","Grand-Est region","ICUBAM tool","Region-wide COVID","number of patients","ICUBAM form","analysis of CCB availability","availability information","number of CCBs","ICU beds","ICU Bed Availability Monitor","CCB availability prediction","ICU admissions","ICU inflow","collected data","calculation of CCB availability","number of ICU refusals","ICU mortality","hard-hit Grand Est region of France","average daily COVID","analysis of data","availability of critical care beds","critical care patients","CCB shortages","occupied CCBs","Grand-Estregion","negative patients","related ICU deaths","number of free","ventilator-equipped CCBs","bed shortages","intensivists","evolution of bed usage","local health agencies","maximum bed capacity","physicians","SEIR models","predictive models","health crisis","long term prediction","correspondence analysis","Reliable information","daily inflow","epidemic","fortnight","ICUs","critical decision-making processes","future admissions","multivariate methods","local healthcare stakeholders","line medical responders","nominal regional capacity","short term statistical model","discharges","week period","statisticians","different scales","Explanatory","numbers","cross-functional team","outcomes","essential component","computer scientists","web link","strong uptake","discharge statistics","extent","effective tools","treatment time","Background","SMS","days","importance","Conclusion","decrease","Results","contributions","French lockdown","peak","month"],"language":"en"},

In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate. In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease. System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures. The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA\u00AE from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"BORDEHORE, CESAR; Navarro, Miriam; Herrador, Zaida; Fonfria, Eva S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce9bb578da4c90de5ff42521070445a83f4a01f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","different scenarios","infectious disease","rapid growth","rapid spreading","novel viral disease","study","governments","effect of different control measures","scenarios comparison","different behavior","system dynamics approach","classical epidemiological measures","need of hospitalization","robust -official","growing speed of new infections","open model","mortality rate","numbers of sick people","demand","intensive care","ways","quarantine","unprecedented effort","biological sciences","medical facilities","turn","society","vaccine","effective tool","SARS-CoV","order","fields","morbidity","physical distancing","changing systems","renowned institutions","absence","STELLA","places","priority","confirmed cases","deaths","area","region","user","Iseesystems","coronavirus","world","fatalities","evolution","intention","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 has not been established to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the duration of fecal swab positivity in COVID-19 patients after pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative and to explore its potential for fecal-oral transmission. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical records, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of 17 COVID-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests from January 22 to February 7, 2020 at a tertiary hospital was performed. The potential of fecal-oral transmission was assessed by detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal swab samples. Results: A total of 16 patients (94.1%) had fever; other symptoms included dry cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle pain. Three patients had decreased white blood cell counts, 7 had decreased lymphocyte numbers, and 7 had increased C-reactive protein levels. Fecal samples of 11 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, of whom the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was longer in 10 patients than that for pharyngeal swab samples, and only one case exhibited a shorter time for his fecal sample to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative compared to his pharyngeal swab sample. The remaining 6 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal samples. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in both pharyngeal swab and fecal samples, the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was generally longer than that in pharyngeal swab samples.

Since, the probability of testing positive in large population studies is expected to be small (\u003C15%), therefore, most of the test outcomes will be negative. Here, we propose the use of agglomerative sampling which can prune out multiple negative cases in a single test by intelligently combining samples from different individuals. The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples.

Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p\u003C0.05. Results: Our cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131), undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions to this pattern.

Participants 31,180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between March 12, and April 14, from 2015 to 2020 Main outcome measures The Main outcome measure was the odds ratio of premature birth, per preterm category, during the lockdown period compared with the calendar match period in the five previous years. Results A total of 31 180 newborns were included in the study period, of these 58 were born extremely premature (gestational age below 28 weeks). The distribution of gestational ages was significantly different (p = 0.004) during the lockdown period compared to the previous five years. The extremely premature birth rate during the lockdown was significantly lower than the corresponding mean rate for the same dates in the previous years (odds ratio 0.09 [95 % CI 0.01 - 0.04], p \u003C 0.001). No significant difference between the lockdown and previous years was found for other gestational age categories. Conclusions The birth rate of extremely premature infants decreased significantly (~90 % reduction) during the Danish nationwide lockdown from a stable rate in the preceding five years. The reasons for this decrease are unclear. Identification of possible causal mechanisms might stimulate changes in clinical practice. Ideally, some cases of extreme prematurity are preventable which may decrease infant morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedermann, G.; Hedley, P.

Due to the unknown nature of the disease and the lack of specific drugs, several potential treatments were used for patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate studies of the effects of Favipiravir in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases including LitCovid hub, PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Embase using keywords related to COVID-19 and Favipiravir. We will search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will also search for clinical trial registries, such as clinicaltrial.gov for the ongoing clinical trials. Two investigators (MAZ and SH) will independently screen titles, abstracts, and full-text of included studies based on eligibility criteria. These investigators will also independently extract data and appraise the quality of studies. All potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. Data synthesis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3) or CMA (version 2). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I2 test. A funnel plot, Egger test, and Begg test will be used for asymmetry to explore possible publication bias. Ethics and dissemination The findings of this systematic review with proportional meta-analysis will help to identify the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir for COVID-19 patients. Knowledge gained from this research will also assist physicians in selecting better treatment options and developing a guideline in this field.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arab-Zozani, M.; Hassanipour, S.; GHoddoosi-Nejad, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40878c70ff24ace8f6351bcf1151b56865334e98.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081471v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","ISI","clinicaltrial.gov","CMA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["systematic review","quality of studies","text of included studies","proportional meta-analysis","Egger test","Begg test","version","effects of Favipiravir","efficacy of Favipiravir","patients","investigators","Review Manager software","standard I2 test","potential treatments","potential discrepancies","Data synthesis","clinical trial registries","ongoing clinical trials","PubMed","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Scopus","LitCovid hub","electronic databases","ISI web of Sciences","disease","Cochrane","lack of specific drugs","asymmetry","findings","guideline","physicians","better treatment options","Introduction","SH","Embase","dissemination","safety","screen titles","funnel plot","reference lists","eligibility criteria","pandemic","World Health Organization","possible publication bias","abstracts","SARS-CoV","consultation","MAZ","keywords","CMA","reviews","unknown nature","Wuhan","China","research","Ethics","Methods","pneumonia","Statistical heterogeneity","Knowledge","reviewer","field"],"language":"en"},

A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population (\u2248 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period TI. Because of the rather long duration of infectious period (\u2248 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R0 provided we have R0 \u003C 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R0 \u003C 0.6. For a larger R0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"ALLALI, MERIEM; PORTECOP, PATRICK; CARLES, MICHEL; GIBERT, DOMINIQUE","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/625768ecea562dee432cf12423c5e5ee44bf3575.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20063008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guadeloupe"],"keyphrases":["number of cases","containment period","number of severe","maximum number of critical cases","likely number of additional cases","larger R0","critical cases of COVID","possible R0","containment effects","beginning","number of infected individuals","larger number of deceased patients","so-called basic reproductive number","infectious period TI","exact value of R0","strict containment rules","Guadeloupe","long duration of infectious period","communication","time-evolution","weeks","stochastic model","single infectious case","high rate of contamination","exponential growth","well-known exponential","long delay","sanitary education of people","particular strength","slower decrease","days","hospital intensive care capacity","point","crucial matter of success","great importance","inhabitants","slowing","appearance","source of discouragement","general characteristics","recognised medical staff","entire population","example","available data","pandemic outbreak","Predictions","models","parameters","conditions"],"language":"en"},

The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan. Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world.

We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. Methods: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. Results: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. Conclusions: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"TONNA, J.

As other European Union member states, Portugal is now preparing the phased loosening of the confinement measures, starting in the beginning of May. Even so, the current data, albeit showing at least a reduction in infection rates, renders difficult to forecast scenarios in the imminent future. Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures. This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower recovery if not of new outbreaks.

While the two Gumbel parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country (and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form of the evolution of N/dN appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities.

It took about 2 months for China to get this infectious disease under control in its epicenter at Wuhan. Since February 2020, COVID-19 has been spreading around the world, becoming widespread in a number of countries. The timing and nature of government actions in response to the pandemic has varied from country to country, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. Method: The present study proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model to perform a comparative analysis of the temporal progress of disease spread in six regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). For each region we developed detailed timelines of reported infections and outcomes, along with government-implemented measures to enforce social distancing. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Results: The main results of this study are as follows: (a) an empirical COVID-19 growth law provides an excellent fit to the disease data in all study regions and potentially could be of more general validity; (b) significant differences exist in the spread characteristics of the disease among the three regions of China and between the three regions of China and the three countries; (c) under the control measures implemented in the Chinese regions (including the immediate quarantine of infected patients and their close contacts, and considerable restrictions on social contacts), the transmission rate of COVID-19 followed a modified normal distribution function, and it reached its peak after 1 to 2 days and then was reduced to zero 11, 11 and 18 days after a 1st-Level Response to Major Public Health Emergency was declared in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang, respectively; moreover, the epidemic control times in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang showed that the epidemic reached an \u0022inflection point\u0022 after 9, 12 and 17 days, respectively, after a 1st-Level Response was issued; (d) an empirical COVID-19 law provided an excellent fit to the disease data in the six study regions, and the law can be potentially of more general validity; and (e) the curves of infected cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been significantly flattened and shrunken at a relatively earlier stage of the epidemic if similar preventive measures as in the Chinese regions had been also taken in the above three countries on February 25th, February 25th and March 8th, respectively: the simulated maximum number of infected individuals in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been 4480 cases (March 9th, 2020), 2335 cases (March 10th) and 6969 cases (March 20th), instead of the actual (reported) numbers of 7212 cases (March 9th), 8514 cases (March 10th, 2020) and 11466 cases (March 20th), respectively; moreover, up to March 29th, the simulated reduction in the accumulated number of infected cases would be 1585 for South Korea, 93490 for Italy and 23213 for Iran, respectively, accounting for 16.41% (South Korea), 95.70% (Italy) and 60.59% (Iran) of the accumulated number of actual reported infected cases. Conclusions: The implemented measures in China were very effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. These measures should be taken as early as possible, including the early identification of all infection sources and eliminating transmission pathways. Subsequently, the number of infected cases can be controlled at a low level, and existing medical resources could be sufficient for maintaining higher cure rates and lower mortality rate compared to the current situations in these countries. The proposed model can account for these prevention and control measures by properly adjusting its parameters, it computes the corresponding variations in disease transmission rate during the outbreak period, and it can provide valuable information for public health decision-making purposes.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Junyu; Chen, Guangwei; Jiang, Yutong; Jin, Runjie; He, Mingjun; Shortridge, Ashton; Wu, Jiaping; Christakos, George","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8018f692b7ec7a86ead09e4fd42c09becd5e3364.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20053223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Major Public Health"],"locations":["China","South Korea","Iran","Xinjiang"],"keyphrases":["regions of China","study regions","Chinese regions","spread of COVID","curves of infected cases","accumulated number of infected cases","South Korea","Italy","control measures","Iran","implemented measures","number of countries","empirical COVID","accumulated number of actual reported infected cases","disease data","severity of COVID","infectious disease","transmission rate of COVID","Zhejiang","Guangdong","similar preventive measures","Xinjiang","days","simulated maximum number of infected individuals","imposition of strong social distancing measures","temporal progress of disease","social contacts","Level Response","present study","spread characteristics","epidemic control times","immediate quarantine of infected patients","excellent fit","growth law","model","country","general validity","close contacts","detailed timelines of reported infections","simulated reduction","transmission pathways","city of Wuhan","early identification","main results","nature of government actions","modified normal distribution function","Major Public Health Emergency","significant differences","infection sources","comparative analysis","outcomes","considerable restrictions","pandemic","Hubei province","SEIR","epicenter","earlier stage","timing","Simulations","outbreak of Coronavirus","role","outbreaks","duration","Conclusions","accounting","inflection point","Background","peak","Method","world","months","numbers","impact","lower mortality rate","disease transmission rate","higher cure rates","valuable information","existing medical resources","public health decision-making purposes","corresponding variations","low level","current situations","outbreak period","prevention","parameters","number of infected cases","proposed model","countries"],"language":"en"},

The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when R\u003C1.Here, we find an analytical expression for R as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for R is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for R allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility kappa_0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be kappa_0 \u2248 0.7.

Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17%, a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the results allow us to identify base pairs sequences that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and do not appear in other virus strains, that could then be used as a base for designing new primers and examined by experts to extract further insights. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopez-Rincon, Alejandro; Tonda, Alberto; Mendoza-Maldonado, Lucero; Claassen, Eric; Garssen, Johan; Kraneveld, Aletta D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a1873bb412f59b9495fba3a7e64bb7f1ec9d833.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990242","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","fast spread of SARS","deep learning","proposed approach","detection tools","HCoV-NL63","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-HKU1","fold accuracy","assisted detection tests","complete viral genome sequences","complete genome non-repeated sequences","base pairs sequences","lack of accuracy","average accuracy","processed data","coronavirus strains","features","sensitivity","specificity","addition","particular virus","overall unsatisfying detection rate","state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network","molecular testing","Molecular techniques","different coronaviruses","preliminary results","Novel Coronavirus Resource","fold cross-validation","nucleic acid sequencing methods","quantitative real-time RT-PCR","promising research venue","human host","diagnostic purposes","missing information","medical doctors","virologists","errors","nCoVR","NCBI","dataset","scientists","gene ORF1ab","clinical field","experts","respiratory infections","identification","new primers","noise","code","Experiments","reasons","interaction","viromics","global infection problems","recent emergence","binary classification","in-depth analysis","issue","length","AUC","basis","pandemic","system","insights","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. Methods The UK Biobank study recruited 40-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including Townsend deprivation index and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for: being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 1,474 had been tested and 669 had tested positive between 16 March and 13 April 2020. Black, south Asian and white Irish people were more likely to have confirmed infection (RR 4.01 (95%CI 2.92-5.12); RR 2.11 (95%CI 1.43-3.10); and RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.08-2.38) respectively) and were more likely to be hospitalised compared to White British. While they were more likely to be tested, they were also more likely to test positive. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Area socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 1.91 (95%CI 1.53-2.38); and RR 2.26 (95%CI 1.76-2.90) respectively). Interpretation Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, measured baseline health or behavioural risk factors.

Modestly sized case series have described clinical factors associated with COVID-19, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression analyses have been described in some cell types. Cancer patients may have worse outcomes to COVID-19. Methods: We performed an integrated study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across and within organ systems, by normal versus tumor, across several existing databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Census of Immune Single Cell Expression Atlas, The Human Cell Landscape, and more). We correlated gene expression with clinical factors (including but not limited to age, gender, race, BMI and smoking history), HLA genotype, immune gene expression patterns, cell subsets, and single-cell sequencing as well as commensal microbiome. Results: Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No clinical factors were consistently identified to be significantly associated with gene expression levels though outlier organ systems were observed for some factors. Similarly, no HLA genotypes were consistently associated with gene expression levels. Strong correlations were observed between ACE2 expression levels and multiple immune gene signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype as well as inverse associations with angiogenesis and transforming growth factor-{beta} signatures. ACE2 positively correlated with macrophage subsets across tumor types. TMPRSS2 was less associated with immune gene expression but was strongly associated with epithelial cell abundance. Single-cell sequencing analysis across nine independent studies demonstrated little to no ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lymphocytes or macrophages. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression associated with commensal microbiota in matched normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers, with distinct bacterial populations showing strong associations. Conclusions: We performed a large-scale integration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across clinical, genetic, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We suggest caution in interpretation regarding genetic associations with ACE2 expression suggested from smaller case series.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bao, R.; Hernandez, K.; Huang, L.; Luke, J.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels. Results We first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. Conclusions Through building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Kun; Gu, Liuqi; Ma, Li; Duan, Yunfeng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac4f83c59c5bfd840d32ba9ff9c744d9c7b3115.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression levels","transmitting SARS-CoV","atlas of ACE2 expression","high level of ACE2 expression","high expression","gene conservation of ACE2","high conservation of ACE2 genes","common mammalian species","presumed hosts of SARS","expression pattern","tracing potential hosts of SARS","broad range of mammalian species","common mammals","mammalian cells","certain human tissues","tissues susceptible","animals","novel insights","humans","valuable insights","peptide levels","novel coronavirus","Background COVID","clinical symptoms of COVID","cat","DNA","skin","eyes","binding","transcriptome datasets","pets","livestock","dog","roles","infection","unified pipeline","patients","close contact","viral transmission","transmembrane protein","comparisons","species-specific manner","Methods","elusive origin","order","worldwide pandemic","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (\u003C= 10 days) and group 2 (\u003E10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jie; Ouyang, Liu; Guo, Pi; Wu, Hai sheng; Fu, Peng; Chen, Yu liang; Yang, Dan; Han, Xiao yu; Cao, Yu kun; Alwalid, Osamah; Tao, Juan; Peng, Shu yi; Shi, He shui; Yang, Fan; Zheng, Chuan sheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c03a559a8cd736704a74adcdc52b7f3a7599281f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["median age of medical staff","medical expertise","prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff","confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff","admission","absence of fever symptoms","HR","days","novel coronavirus epidemic","higher levels of IL","hospital discharge rate","symptoms onset","milder symptoms","coronavirus disease","duration of symptoms","fever clinics","abnormal IL","clinical characteristics","favorable clinical course","COVID","retrospective study","SARS-Cov","Union Hospital","patients","clinical data","study period","China","groups","younger age","Smaller BMI","Wuhan city","unfavorable factors","median time interval","exact patterns of SARS","Higher body mass index","Huanan seafood wholesale market","exposure","wildlife","change","infection","Findings","underlying diseases","cough","cohort","intensive care unit","subjects","years old","Interpretation","Cox regression model","Kaplan-Meier plot","ground-glass","common symptom","small proportion","subpleural","Chest CT","Methods","total","isolation wards","nurses","opacities","specimens","fatigue","lymphocytopenia","Backgrounds","areas","studies"],"language":"en"},

Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG \u0026 Vircell COVID-19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in-house developed assays (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay. For all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18) after PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. With exception of one sample, all positive tested samples in the analysed cohort, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT, indicating a potential protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding specificity, there was evidence that samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result (may giving a false sense of security). This need to be further investigated.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kohmer, Niko; Westhaus, Sandra; R\u00FChl, Cornelia; Ciesek, Sandra; Rabenau, Holger F.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6591c53501345df71d9fb2732abd0665cbbcb7e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.085506","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epstein Barr"],"organizations":["IgG \u0026 Vircell","IgG/IgM Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ELISA assays","ELISA IgG","available assays","examined assays","serological assays","in-house developed assays","positive tested samples","Euroimmun SARS-CoV","current SARS-CoV","plasma samples of individuals PCR","detected IgG antibodies","FaStep COVID","Vircell COVID","real patient samples","in-house developed IFA","samples of endemic coronavirus","PRNT","potential protective immunity","days","infected individuals cross","false positive result","immunofluorescence assay","IgM Rapid Test Device","available tests","HCoV-OC43","rapid diagnosis","lateral flow assay","false sense of security","plaque reduction neutralization test","Epstein Barr virus","EBV","LFA","analysed cohort","severe clinical course","comparison","neutralizing","case","pandemic","performance","tracing","evidence","serum","early phase of infection","little data","properties","epidemiological studies","in-patient hospital","later period","exception","specificity","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

This paper uses a global model with a sample of 41 countries to study the interdependencies between COVID-19 health shocks, populations\u0027 risk perceptions about the disease, and their social distancing responses; it also provides some early evidence about potential economic effects. Social networks are a central component in understanding the international transmission. We exploit a dataset on existing social connections across country borders, made available by Facebook, and show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease, but also cross-country spillovers in risk perceptions and in social behavior. Social distancing responses across countries are measured based on aggregated mobility tracking indicators, obtained from Google Mobility Reports. We estimate a Global VAR (GVAR) model, which allows for endogeneity of each health, social, and economic, domestic variable, and for a dependence of domestic variables on country-specific foreign aggregates, which depend in turn on the matrix of social connections. Our empirical results highlight the importance of cross-country interdependencies and social networks. Risk perceptions and social responses are affected by experiences abroad, with Italy and the U.S. playing large roles in our sample. The social distancing responses to domestic health shocks are heterogeneous across countries, but they share some similarities: they adjust only gradually and with delay, hence displaying adaptive behavior. Early indicators are suggestive of unemployment consequences that vary widely across countries, depending on their labor market characteristics. Unemployment is particularly responsive to health shocks in the U.S. and Spain, while the fluctuations are attenuated almost everywhere else.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milani, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd14bb8eae325282aff7124d70ff05324f27e0b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094748v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Mobility Reports"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["social responses","Social networks","social behavior","social distancing responses","existing social connections","matrix of social connections","domestic health shocks","populations\u0027 risk perceptions","importance of cross-country interdependencies","Early indicators","disease","global model","COVID","sample","understanding","spread","dependence of domestic variables","country borders","cross-country spillovers","aggregated mobility tracking indicators","early evidence","Global VAR","adaptive behavior","importance of countries\u0027 interconnections","Google Mobility Reports","suggestive of unemployment consequences","potential economic effects","country-specific foreign aggregates","central component","Facebook","pandemic","dataset","empirical results","Italy","international transmission","large roles","GVAR","Spain","experiences","endogeneity","labor market characteristics","delay","paper","fluctuations","virus","similarities"],"language":"en"},

In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro, Marcia C; Resende de Carvalho, Lucas; Chin, Taylor; Kahn, Rebecca; Franca, Giovanny V.

We analyzed the microbiota of the digestive tract, gills, and skin in mariculture-raised S. officinalis using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR and fluorescence spectral imaging. Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. This Vibrio was also the primary ASV found in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at lower abundance as determined by qPCR and was found only scattered in the lumen rather than in a discrete layer via imaging analysis. Treatment of animals with the commonly-used antibiotic enrofloxacin led to a nearly 80% reduction of the dominant Vibrio ASV in the esophagus but did not significantly alter the relative abundance of bacteria overall between treated versus control animals. Data from the gills was dominated by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from eggs in captivity, and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites. IMPORTANCE Microbes can play critical roles in the physiology of their animal hosts, as evidenced in cephalopods by the role of Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri in the light organ of the bobtail squid and the role of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria in the reproductive system and egg defense in a variety of cephalopods. We sampled the cuttlefish microbiome throughout the digestive tract, gills, and skin and found dense colonization of an unexpected site, the esophagus, by a microbe of the genus Vibrio, as well as colonization of gills by Piscirickettsiaceae. This finding expands the range of organisms and body sites known to be associated with Vibrio and is of potential significance for understanding host-symbiont associations as well as for understanding and maintaining the health of cephalopods in mariculture.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lutz, Holly L.; Ram\u00EDrez-Puebla, S.

The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (\u226449), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (\u226570). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (\u03B2value=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (\u03B2value=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (\u03B2value=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chenyun; Yang, Yun-zhi; Zhang, Xiao Ming; Xu, Xinying; Dou, Qing-Li; Zhang, Wen-Wu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20032003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["medical worker anxiety","prevalence of anxiety","severe anxiety","medical staff worker","high anxiety scores","high risk of anxiety","higher anxiety scores","mental health of frontline medical staff","direct contact","Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale","infected patients","COVID","parts of China","\u03B2value","healthcare workers","age","non-suspect cases","gender","education","independent factors","influencing factors","marital status","Hubei province","outbreak","Results","psychological disorders","cross-sectional study","appropriate psychological intervention programs","SAS","priority","early detection","government authorities","important variable","sociodemographic characteristics","adjusted models","SARS-Cov","multivariable linear regression","virus","Background","Similar things","concern","adverse effect","criteria of normal","Methods","Conclusion","epidemic","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Results: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20/27 (74%) available saliva; 7/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P\u003C0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. Conclusions: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chau, N. V. V.; Lam, V. T.; Dung, N.

The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which have already been reduced to small and endangered populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies have shown that rhesus macaques exposed to the virus develop COVID-19-like symptoms, the susceptibility of other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions may be necessary to limit their exposure to humans.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melin, Amanda D.; Janiak, Mareike C.; Marrone, Frank; Arora, Paramjit S.; Higham, James P.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/097a39a13d9a6d157e03afe316ce2bb7b26a7376.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection susceptibility","critical residues","lemurs","critical threat","human ACE2","virus recognition","infection studies","Asian monkeys","viral infection","significant contact residues","contact surface of ACE2","key amino acid residues","nonhuman primates","apes","catarrhines","humans","receptor binding domain","existential threat","protein modeling","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","binding affinity","spike protein","host cell receptor","fatal disease COVID","closest living relatives","variations","deaths","RBD","lorisoids","set","tens of thousands","huge global disruption","rhesus macaques","bonobos","angiotensin","orangutans","differences","enzyme","gorillas","chimpanzees","emergence","tarsiers","Americas","symptoms","species","endangered populations","Urgent actions","exposure","study","survival"],"language":"en"},

Methods : We performed a retrospective study on severe COVID-19 patients with hyper-inflammatory features admitted outside intensive care units (ICUs). Patients treated with intravenous TCZ in addition to standard of care were compared to patients treated with standard of care alone. Safety and efficacy were assessed over a 28-day follow-up. Results : 65 patients were included, 32 were of whose treated with TCZ. At baseline, all patients were on high-flow supplemental oxygen and most (78% of TCZ patients and 61% of standard treatment patients) were on non-invasive ventilation.

[Methods] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, Analysis of 66,492 confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland. [Results] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 54,406 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 37,914 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline.

[Conclusion] Starting from February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of the NCP is gradually decrease in China mainland. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved. Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time. However, the turning point of the epidemic in mainland China has not yet occurred. On February 12, 2020, the turning point of the epidemic in China mainland except Hubei province, has turned up.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"youbin, Liu; bao hong, Li","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dac1b1607ae72b9509ab26367e0d55016e8132a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCP"],"locations":["China","Hubei"],"keyphrases":["China mainland","mainland China","number of confirmed cases of NCP","cases of NCP deaths","number of suspected cases of NCP","cumulative confirmed cases","transmission of NCP","spread index of NCP","extinction index of NCP","Hubei Province","number of deaths","epidemic","total","trend of outbreak control","gradual decline","cumulative cure","cure rate","continuous decline","mortality","gradual increase","turning point","Wuhan city","decrease","significant downward trend","occurrence of novel coronavirus pneumonia","Judging","treatment","slowdown","epidemiological rules","key","effect of prevention","Analysis","maximum","Objective","time","Methods","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Summary Objective: In the Basque Country, two cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed on February 28 2020. On March 14, the Spanish Government established a state of alarm. Only cases confirmed by molecular biology (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) were known. We launched a web-based surveillance tool to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 to contribute to Public Health decision-making. Material and methods: We implemented an anonymous web questionnaire and disseminated it through online social media social. We collected epidemiological information about \u0022time\u0022 (date of onset of symptoms), \u0022place\u0022 (zip code), and \u0022person\u0022 (gender, age). We compared cases detected by RT-PCR with the estimated cases, according to the case definition of the Ministry of Health. We calculated the questionnaire response rate and the cumulative incidence at 14 days. Results: Between March 19 and 26, 128,009 people answered the questionnaire (5.5% of the Basque population). Of these, 26,375 met the case definition (symptom prevalence of 21.4%). The estimated cases were almost six times more than COVID-19 positive RT-PCR. The estimated 14-day cumulative incidence was 578.3 per 100,000 population compared to RT-PCR positive cases, which was 139.6 per 100,000 population. Conclusions: This tool was useful in estimating the minimum number of symptomatic cases in the Basque Country, which could support Public Health actions.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garitano, Ignacio; Linaresa, Manuel; Santosa, Laura; Santamar\u00EDa, Virginia; Galicia, Fabio; Ramos, Jos\u00E9 M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/595ec751ee0afbae9025e690006c524aedbc62b5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1138359320301726; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1138359320301726?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ministerio de Sanidad Consumo y Bienestar Social","Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Euskadi"],"keyphrases":["the number of symptomatic cases of COVID","of the Basque population","met the","definition of the Ministry of Health","casos de COVID","PCR with the estimated cases","two cases of COVID","Of these","of onset of symptoms","We calculated the questionnaire","PCR positivos","The estimated cases were almost six","people answered the questionnaire","casos estimados","This tool was useful in estimating the minimum number of symptomatic cases in the Basque Country","symptom prevalence of","the Spanish Government established a state of alarm","rate and the cumulative incidence at","We compared cases detected by RT","than COVID","casos positivos detectados","m\u00EDnimo n\u00FAmero de casos sintom\u00E1ticos","We launched a web","Material and methods","cuestionario web an\u00F3nimo","which was","population compared","n\u00FAmero m\u00EDnimo","Only cases confirmed by molecular biology","We implemented an anonymous web questionnaire and disseminated it through online social media social","day cumulative incidence was","Bienestar Social","were known","Public Health decision","On March","Euskadi","informaci\u00F3n \u00FAtil","informaci\u00F3n epidemiol\u00F3gica","\u00FAnica informaci\u00F3n","definici\u00F3n de caso","incidencia acumulada","d\u00EDas","We collected epidemiological information about","were diagnosed on February","which could support Public Health actions","aciones de salud p\u00FAblica","Between March","habitantes comparada","based surveillance tool","herramienta de vigilancia basada","according","Ministerio de Sanidad Consumo","tiempo","toma de decisiones","Conclusions","days","Summary Objective","variables","utilidad","m\u00E9todos","veces","fecha de inicio","chain reaction","Gobierno espa\u00F1ol","estado de alarma","lugar","c\u00F3digo postal","s\u00EDntomas","gender","zip code","tasa de respuesta","making","Results","Resumen Objetivo","g\u00E9nero","edad","age","Conclusiones","personas","poblaci\u00F3n vasca","redes sociales","Resultados"],"language":"es"},

Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains allows for the reconstruction of transmission history connecting these infections. Here, we analyze 346 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected between 20 February and 15 March 2020 from infected patients in Washington State, USA. We found that the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections sampled during this time frame appeared to have derived from a single introduction event into the state in late January or early February 2020 and subsequent local spread, strongly suggesting cryptic spread of COVID-19 during the months of January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was implemented. We estimate a common ancestor of this outbreak clade as occurring between 18 January and 9 February 2020. From genomic data, we estimate an exponential doubling between 2.4 and 5.1 days. These results highlight the need for large-scale community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 introductions and spread and the power of pathogen genomics to inform epidemiological understanding.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bedford, Trevor; Greninger, Alexander L.; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Starita, Lea M; Famulare, Michael; Huang, Meei-Li; Nalla, Arun; Pepper, Gregory; Reinhardt, Adam; Xie, Hong; Shrestha, Lasata; Nguyen, Truong N; Adler, Amanda; Brandstetter, Elisabeth; Cho, Shari; Giroux, Danielle; Han, Peter D; Fay, Kairsten; Frazar, Chris D; Ilcisin, Misja; Lacombe, Kirsten; Lee, Jover; Kiavand, Anahita; Richardson, Matthew; Sibley, Thomas R; Truong, Melissa; Wolf, Caitlin R; Nickerson, Deborah A; Rieder, Mark J; Englund, Janet A; Hadfield, James; Hodcroft, Emma B; Huddleston, John; Moncla, Louise H; M\u00FCller, Nicola F; Neher, Richard A; Deng, Xianding; Gu, Wei; Federman, Scot; Chiu, Charles; Duchin, Jeff; Gautom, Romesh; Melly, Geoff; Hiatt, Brian; Dykema, Philip; Lindquist, Scott; Queen, Krista; Tao, Ying; Uehara, Anna; Tong, Suxiang; MacCannell, Duncan; Armstrong, Gregory L; Baird, Geoffrey S; Chu, Helen Y; Shendure, Jay; Jerome, Keith R","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eea835e5cfdbc88e33bab370e2e513fe81753fb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051417","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Genome sequencing of SARS","large majority of SARS","cryptic spread of COVID","infections","subsequent local spread","large-scale community surveillance","active community surveillance","Washington State","World Health Organization","Coronavirus Disease","need","power of pathogen genomics","infected patients","USA","China","strains","reconstruction of transmission history","single introduction event","exponential doubling","epidemiological understanding","common ancestor","outbreak clade","Wuhan","results","genomes","introductions","genomic data","days","emergence","time frame","samples","pandemic","months"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies using the rodent malaria model indicate that the dermal inoculation site may be where sporozoites are most vulnerable to antibodies, yet, functional in vivo assays with human malaria parasites are lacking. Here, we present the first characterization of P. falciparum sporozoites in the skin, comparing their motility to two rodent malaria species and investigating whether the environment of its natural host influences P. falciparum sporozoite motility using a human skin xenograft model. The combined data suggest that in contrast to the liver and blood stages, the skin is not a species-specific barrier for Plasmodium. We observe that P. falciparum sporozoites inoculated into mouse skin move with similar speed, displacement and duration, and enter blood vessels in similar numbers as the rodent parasites. Thus, interventions targeting P. falciparum sporozoite migration can be tested in the murine dermis. Importantly, to streamline quantification of sporozoite motility, we developed a toolbox allowing for automated detection and tracking of sporozoites in intravital microscopy videos. This establishes a platform to test vaccine candidates, immunization protocols, monoclonal antibodies and drug candidates for their impact on human malaria sporozoites in vivo. Screening of intervention strategies for in vivo efficacy against Pf sporozoites using this new platform will have the potential to validate targets prior to expensive clinical trials.","publish_time":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hopp, Christine S.; Kanatani, Sachie; Archer, Nathan K.; Miller, Robert J.; Liu, Haiyun; Chiou, Kevin; Miller, Lloyd S.; Sinnis, Photini","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6bf4373c9f619dd5b3d36d4bc3391fd9e272531.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/716878","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["falciparum sporozoites","human malaria sporozoites","tracking of sporozoites","Pf sporozoites","falciparum sporozoite motility","rodent malaria model","human malaria parasites","host\u2019s skin","mouse skin","rodent malaria species","Malaria infection","human skin xenograft model","injection of motile Plasmodium sporozoites","falciparum sporozoite migration","rodent parasites","quantification of sporozoite motility","drug candidates","monoclonal antibodies","vaccine candidates","similar speed","similar numbers","blood vessels","blood stages","new platform","immunization protocols","efficacy","natural host influences","impact","contrast","potential","duration","environment","toolbox","displacement","dermal inoculation site","assays","automated detection","intravital microscopy videos","targets","Screening of intervention strategies","liver","Previous studies","expensive clinical trials","mosquito bite","species-specific barrier","interventions","combined data","characterization of","murine dermis"],"language":"en"},

Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities. Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Alex; Hendy, Shaun C; Plank, Michael J; Steyn, Nicholas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa2714e4a4d90e52503de48044738e209e5ec421.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044677","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["Control aims","Suppression strategies","efficacy of control measures","immediate control","effectiveness of various control strategies","combination of successful suppression","failure of mitigation strategies","strong border measures","New Zealand","cases","herd immunity","types of strategy","types of approach","controlled outbreak","combination of national interventions","population-wide social distancing","household quarantine","case isolation","widespread contact tracing","containment","closure of schools","testing","standard SEIR-type compartment model","healthcare systems","NZ","vaccine","significant overloads","advantage","growing outbreaks","ability","periods","timing","unfolding events","treatment","universities","absolute minimum","uncertainty","spread of Covid19","time","countries","epidemic","controls","handful"],"language":"en"},

Viral lipids are essential components, and viral-cell membrane fusion is the required entry step for most unrelated enveloped viruses. In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses including Lassa virus (LASV), Machupo virus (MACV), and SARS-CoV-2 as well as various subtypes of influenza A viral strains with IC50 values ranging from 0.91\u00B10.25 \u03BCM to 1.88\u00B10.34 \u03BCM. A mechanistic study using influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a testing strain showed that PPIX inhibits the infection in the early stage of virus entry through biophysically interacting with the hydrophobic lipids of enveloped virions, thereby inhibiting the formation of the negative curvature required for fusion and blocking the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the preliminary antiviral activities of PPIX were further assessed by testing mice infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The results showed that compared with the control group without drug treatment, the survival rate and mean survival time of the mice treated with PPIX were apparently prolonged. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using PPIX as a lead compound for the rational design of lipid-targeting antivirals for the treatment of infection with enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Shengsheng; Pan, Xiaoyan; Chen, Daiwei; Xie, Xi; Wu, Yan; Shang, Weijuan; Jiang, Xiaming; Sun, Yuan; Fan, Sheng; He, Jian","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1da4ebdf93ff5aff394bf356981420cf6c7b4e43.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.085811","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPIX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of enveloped viruses","Lassa virus","unrelated enveloped viruses","Machupo virus","Viral lipids","panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses","viral infections","viral strains","early stage of virus entry","Avian influenza","preliminary antiviral activities of PPIX","virus life cycle","hydrophobic lipids of enveloped virions","viral-cell membrane fusion","required entry step","treatment of infection","various subtypes of influenza","Puerto Rico","H1N1","testing mice","SARS-CoV","\u03BCM","broad antiviral activities","conserved components","Lassa fever","survival rate","essential components","drug treatment","testing strain","mean survival time","development of broad-spectrum antivirals","LASV","lead compound","rational design of lipid","MACV","IC50 values","new strategies","control group","formation","investigations","host cells","porphyrin derivative of protoporphyrin","mechanistic study","negative curvature","addition","COVID","paper","results","data"],"language":"en"},

Children were classified into 3 groups UALG1, UALG2 and UALG3 according to the following UAL limits: [\u2264] 150 mm, 151-180, and \u003E 180mm respectively. We used a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to determine the best MUAC cut-off for each group with weight-for-height Z score as a reference standard. We compared the wasting prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, of all diagnostic methods. Findings: In total, 12 619 children were included in the study. Wasting prevalence was 16.1%, 5.0% and 12.5% when diagnosed by WHZ \u003C -2, MUAC \u003C 125 mm and MUAC-UALG methods respectively. Using the MUAC-UALG method increased the sensitivity for wasting diagnosis from 17.98 % with MUAC \u003C 125 mm to 39.43% with MUAC-UALG. The specificity decreased from 97.49% with MUAC \u003C 125 to 92.71% with MUAC-UALG. With MUAC-height Z score and MUAC \u003C 138 mm, sensitivity was 26.04% and 69.76%and specificity were 97.40%and 75.64% respectively.

These exacerbated a complex fear among the public. The aim of this article is, therefore, to understand the public perception of socioeconomic crisis and human stress in resource-limited settings of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample comprised of 1066 Bangladeshi participants. Principal component analysis (PCA) was considered to design a standardized scale to measure the mental stress and socioeconomic crisis, one-way ANOVA and t-test were conducted to perceive different demographic risk groups; multiple linear regression was applied to estimate the statistically significant association between each component, and classical test theory (CTT) analysis was applied to examine the reliability of each item according to the components to develop a composite score. Without safeguarding the fundamental needs for the vulnerable ultra-poor group can undeniably cause the socioeconomic crisis and mental stress due to the COVID-19 lockdown. It has further created unemployment, deprivation, hunger, and social conflicts. The weak governance in the fragile healthcare system exacerbates the general public\u0027s anxiety as the COVID-19 testing facilities are centered around in the urban areas, a long serial to be tested, minimum or no treatment facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients are the chief observations hampered along with the disruption of other critical healthcare services. One-way ANOVA and t-test confirmed food and nutritional deficiency among the vulnerable poorest section due to loss of livelihood. Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed. Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested. Finally, this assessment process could help the government and policymakers to judge the public perceptions to deal with COVID-19 pandemic in densely populated lower-middle-income and limited-resource countries like Bangladesh.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shammi, Mashura; Bodrud-Doza, Md.; Towfiqul Islam, Abu Reza Md.; Rahman, Md.

But sometimes it is important to predict the future and concern the government. A furious future is waiting for Bangladesh. Objective: Objective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh. Study design: This study was designed with systematic review and data analysis. Method: The study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series. Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made. Result: It has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 17024322 and total death can be 86265 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher. Policy Suggestion: Government should choose properly one between two options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life. A very weak lock down for a long time does not make any sense.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shuvo, S.

Objectives: To synthesise existing evidence about communication practices used to discuss difficult matters, including prognosis and end of life, and to use this evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice. The aim of this study was to use rapid review methods to update findings from a previous systematic review published in 2014. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA and Amed. Study eligibility criteria: Studies using conversation analysis or discourse analysis to examine recordings of actual conversations about difficult matters relating to future illness progression and end of life. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Data appraisal and extraction procedures used in the 2014 review were modified for this rapid review. Results: Following screening, 18 sources were deemed to meet eligibility criteria, which were added to the 19 sources included in the 2014 systematic review. Synthesis of study findings identified 11 communication practices: providing opportunities for patient or family members to propose matters to discuss (7 out of 37 included sources); seeking a patient or family member\u0027s perspective (6/37); discussing the future indirectly (11/37); discussing the future explicitly (7/37) linking to something previously said or done (11/37); using hypothetical scenarios (13/37); framing a difficult matter as universal (5/37); acknowledging uncertainty (3/37); exploring options (2/37); displaying sensitivity (7/37); emphasising the positive (7/37).

The epidemiological trends of mild COVID-19 are however still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy asymptomatic adults, the risk factors, and laboratory correlates. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study during the outbreak. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies against the Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Setting: Blood center at a leading academic hospital serving as COVID-19 referral center. Participants: We considered a random sample of blood donors since the start of the outbreak (February 24th to April 8th 2020, n=789). Main outcome measures: The main outcome was the prevalence of IgG/IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies . Results: The test had a 98.3% specificity and 100% sensitivity, and for IgG was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P\u003C0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (2.3 to 7.9; P\u003C0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in seroprevalence to 7.1% (4.4 to 10.8), due to a rise in IgG\u002B to 5% (2.8 to 8.2; P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7, SE 1.3%), but not of IgM\u002B (P=NS). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, seroconversion to IgG was more frequent in younger (P=0.043), while recent infections (IgM\u002B) in older individuals (P=0.002). IgM\u002B was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P\u003C0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 4.4-10.8% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion.

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a global conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ). Methods: An electronic-based survey was conducted between March 29th 2020 and March 31st 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from Health, Scientific and Humanities Schools at UJ. Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a global conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period. Results: The total number of participants was 1540 students. The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n=1079, 70.1%), with males, Jordanians and participants with lower income being more inclined to feel that the disease is very dangerous (p\u003C0.001, 0.020, and \u003C0.001, respectively). Lower level of knowledge and higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a global conspiracy (p\u003C0.001 and p=0.004, respectively). Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy (p=0.001 and p\u003C0.001, respectively). Belief in global conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment (p=0.001 and p\u003C0.001, respectively). Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n=1018). Conclusions: The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sallam, Malik; Dababseh, Deema; Yaseen, Alaa\u0027; Al-Haidar, Ayat; Ababneh, Nidaa A.; Bakri, Faris G.; Mahafzah, Azmi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f95138286e964296629382fcdb4fc851c1f7ba2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20064147v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Jordan","Health, Scientific and Humanities Schools"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global conspiracy","higher level of anxiety","origin of COVID","consequence of lower level of knowledge","anxiety levels","lower income","majority of participants","false belief","burden of coronavirus disease","postgraduate students","total number of participants","sources of information","items","Ministry of Health","mutual effects of belief","UJ","socio-demographic information","health care systems","common source of information","current pandemic","University of Jordan","false notion","Survey sections","electronic-based survey","educational deficits","awareness tools of various media platforms","addition","therapeutic use of antibiotics","attitude","availability of vaccine","Humanities Schools","study","Jordanians","treatment","targeted population","quarantine period","Methods","Results","misinformation","Females","Conclusions","main aim","public","Background","world"],"language":"en"},

Prior research on this topic has been inconclusive. Identifying key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impact on transmission we study this question using one of the largest assembled databases of COVID-19 infections and weather. Methods: We assemble a dataset that includes virus transmission and weather data across 3,739 locations from December 12, 2019 to April 22, 2020. Using simulation, we identify key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impacts on transmission, design a statistical method to overcome these challenges, and validate it in a blinded simulation study. Using this method and controlling for location-specific response trends we estimate how different weather variables are associated with the reproduction number for COVID-19. We then use the estimates to project the relative weather-related risk of COVID-19 transmission across the world and in large cities. Results: We show that the delay between exposure and detection of infection complicates the estimation of weather impact on COVID-19 transmission, potentially explaining significant variability in results to-date. Correcting for that distributed delay and offering conservative estimates, we find a negative relationship between temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius and estimated reproduction number ([R]), with each degree Celsius associated with a 3.1% (95% CI, 1.5% to 4.8%) reduction in [R]. Higher levels of relative humidity strengthen the negative effect of temperature above 25 degrees. Moreover, one millibar of additional pressure increases [R] by approximately 0.8 percent (95% CI, 0.6% to 1%) at the median pressure (1016 millibars) in our sample. We also find significant positive effects for wind speed, precipitation, and diurnal temperature on [R]. Sensitivity analysis and simulations show that results are robust to multiple assumptions. Despite conservative estimates, weather effects are associated with a 43% change in [R] between the 5th and 95th percentile of weather conditions in our sample. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for the relationship between several weather variables and the spread of COVID-19. However, the (conservatively) estimated relationships are not strong enough to seasonally control the epidemic in most locations.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, R.; Rahmandad, H.; Gupta, M.; DiGennaro, C.; Ghaffarzadegan, N.; Jalali, M.

To probe the origin and transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences of viruses available in the GISAID platform as of March 05, 2020. A substantial number of earliest sequences reported in Wuhan in December 2019, including those of viruses recovered from the Huanan Seafood Market (HNSM), the site of the initial outbreak, were genetically diverse, suggesting that viruses of multiple sources were involved in the original outbreak. The viruses were subsequently disseminated to different parts of China and other countries, with diverse mutational profiles being recorded in strains recovered subsequently. Interestingly, four genetic clusters defined as Super-transmitters (STs) were found to become dominant and were responsible for the major outbreaks in various countries. Among the four clusters, ST1 is widely disseminated in Asia and the US and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California in the US as well as those in South Korea at the end of February and early March, whereas ST4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Each ST cluster carried a signature mutation profile which allowed us to trace the origin and transmission patterns of specific viruses in different parts of the world. Using the signature mutations as markers of STs, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after February 29, 2020. We found that around 90% of these genomes belonged to STs with ST4 being the dominant one and their contribution to pandemic in different continents were also depicted. The identification of these super-transmitters provides insight into the control of further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"YANG, Xuemei; Dong, Ning; CHAN, Wai-Chi; CHEN, Sheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e62a454b436adc90ea12c5e186a4252f9787a83.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071399v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST"],"locations":["China","Wuhan","Asia","Washington","California","South Korea","Europe"],"keyphrases":["transmission patterns of specific viruses","transmission of SARS","various countries","viruses of multiple sources","different parts of China","high quality genomic sequences of viruses available","major outbreaks","Super-transmitters","different continents","transmission dynamics","genome sequences","markers of STs","SARS-CoV","ST4","pandemic","world","severe outbreaks of pneumonia","substantial number of earliest sequences","signature mutations","original outbreak","initial outbreak","genetic clusters","diverse mutational profiles","signature mutation profile","phylodynamic analysis","insight","control","Huanan Seafood Market","HNSM","site","ST cluster","states of Washington","contribution","GISAID platform","end","strains","California","Wuhan","emerged coronavirus","identification","Asia","South Korea","ST1","Europe","genomes"],"language":"en"},

In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is well-known to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients. Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine/taurine) and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, T.; Stefanoni, D.; Reisz, J.

Design: Stool samples from routine primary care practice in Oxfordshire, UK were analysed using the HM-JACKarc FIT method between March 2017 to March 2020. Clinical details described on the test request were recorded. Patients were followed up for up-to 36 months in linked hospital records for evidence of benign and serious (colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas and bowel inflammation) colorectal disease. The diagnostic accuracy of FIT is reported by gender, age, and FIT threshold. Results: In 9,896 adult patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, a FIT result [\u2265]10 ug/g had an overall sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 90.5% (95% CI 84.9%-96.1%), women 90.0 (80.7-99.3), men 90.8 (83.7-97.8); overall specificity 91.3 (90.8-91.9), women 92.4 (91.8-93.1), men 89.8 (88.8-90.7); overall Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 10.1 (8.15-12.0), women 7.64 (5.24-10.0), men 12.5 (9.52-15.5)); and an overall Negative Predictive Value (NPV) 99.9 (99.8-100.0), women 99.8 (99.7-100.), men 99.9 (99.9-100.0). The PPV and specificity of FIT were higher for serious colorectal disease combined and the sensitivity and NPV were lower than for colorectal cancer alone. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for all patients did not change substantially by increasing the minimum age of testing. In this population, 10% would be further investigated to detect 91% of the cancers at 10ug/g and 3% further investigated to detect 54% of the cancers at 150ug/g. The number needed to scope to detect one cancer at was ten using FIT at 10ug/g. Conclusion: A FIT threshold of 10ug/g is appropriate to triage adult patients presenting to primary care with symptoms of serious colorectal disease. FIT may provide an appropriate approach to reprioritising patients colorectal cancer symptoms whose tests have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholson, B.

This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socio-economic factors largely depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the further spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified. Methods We analyze the geographical distribution of known cases per capita across 401 local districts in Germany, once for infections in the initial phase and for new infections during the second phase. Results In Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase, richer districts and districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections, whilst the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts disappears. Conclusion The social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in Germany. Only in the second phase does socio-economic advantage turn into a safety advantage. Thus, suggestions that the pandemic predominantly hits the poor needs to be qualified.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pluemper, T.; Neumayer, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20105395v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","USA"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["initial phase","pandemic","initial spread of infections","virus","Germany","initial safety advantage","local districts","deprived districts","richer districts","socio-economic advantage","poorer individuals","ability of individuals","fewer new infections","social stratification of Covid","negative association","positive association","socio-economic factors","indicators of social deprivation","employees","higher share of university","infection rates","wealth","correlation","geographical distribution of known cases","precautionary measures","UK","Alps","governments","changes","lockdowns","USA","skiing","Conclusion","phases","Background Reports","international travel","article","complex picture","Methods","poor needs","neighbourhoods","Results","country","suggestions","extent"],"language":"en"},

Pharmacological modulation of metabolism-dependent cellular pathways such as autophagy reduced propagation of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection limits autophagy by interfering with multiple metabolic pathways and that compound-driven interventions aimed at autophagy induction reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro. In-depth analyses of autophagy signaling and metabolomics indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reduces glycolysis and protein translation by limiting activation of AMP-protein activated kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Infection also downregulates autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1). Targeting of these pathways by exogenous administration of spermidine, AKT inhibitor MK-2206, and the Beclin-1 stabilizing, antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by 85, 88, and \u003E99%, respectively. In sum, SARS-CoV-2 infection causally diminishes autophagy.

Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration.

Data are extracted from four sources, recorded using five clinical terminologies and stored in different schemas. The aims of our research were to: a) develop a semi-supervised approach for bootstrapping EHR phenotyping algorithms in UKB EHR, and b) to evaluate our approach by implementing and evaluating phenotypes for 31 common biomarkers. Materials and Methods We describe an algorithmic approach to phenotyping biomarkers in primary care EHR involving a) bootstrapping definitions using existing phenotypes, b) excluding generic, rare or semantically distant terms, c) forward-mapping terminology terms, d) expert review, and e) data extraction. We evaluated the phenotypes by assessing the ability to reproduce known epidemiological associations with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. Results We created and evaluated phenotyping algorithms for 31 biomarkers many of which are directly related to COVID-19 complications e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease. Our algorithm identified 1651 Read v2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 terms and automatically excluded 1228 terms. Clinical review excluded 103 terms and included 44 terms, resulting in 364 terms for data extraction (sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.92). We extracted 38,190,682 events and identified 220,978 participants with at least one biomarker measured. Discussion and conclusion Bootstrapping phenotyping algorithms from similar EHR can potentially address pre-existing methodological concerns that undermine the outputs of biomarker discovery pipelines and provide research-quality phenotyping algorithms.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Denaxas, S.; Shah, A.; Mateen, B.; Kuan, V.; Quint, J.; Fitzpatrick, N.; Torralbo, A.; Fatemifar, G.; Hemingway, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7c826701a3968cda59d04fbac320953f4be934c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101626v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Electronic Health Records","EHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distant terms","bootstrapping EHR phenotyping algorithms","phenotyping biomarkers","Clinical Terms Version","evaluated phenotyping algorithms","UKB EHR","mapping terminology terms","conclusion Bootstrapping phenotyping algorithms","research-quality phenotyping algorithms","similar EHR","primary care EHR","Clinical review","data extraction","related research","bootstrapping definitions","algorithmic approach","clinical terminologies","existing phenotypes","common biomarkers","COVID","semi-supervised approach","expert review","cardiovascular disease","respiratory disease","participants available","primary care Electronic Health Records","outputs of biomarker discovery pipelines","all-cause mortality","known epidemiological associations","Cox proportional hazards models","diabetes","pre-existing methodological concerns","v2","ability","complications","sensitivity","Discussion","UK Biobank","Objectives","different schemas","Methods","specificity","sources","Materials","events","aims"],"language":"en"},

Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 {\u002B/-} 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19. Further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for COVID-19 control.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, L.; Deng, C.; Chen, X.; Zhang, X.; Chen, B.; Yu, H.; Qin, Y.; Xiao, K.; Zhang, H.; Sun, X.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09364e7ab3ba9a1a0adbe89a3c61ac51b6feb789.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.20034678v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Dry eye","clinical characteristics of COVID","eye protections","related ocular symptoms","history of eye disease","Tongji Hospital","complete profiling of COVID","hand-eye contact history","Mobile Cabin Hospital","eye-care equipment","median age of patients","dirty hand-eye contact","high risk factor of COVID","common clinical symptoms","ocular manifestations","systemic concomitant symptoms","average duration of conjunctival congestion","exposure history","detection","conjunctivitis","total","days","positive SARS-CoV","clinical diagnostic significance","demographic characteristics","previous studies","Previous study","novel coronavirus disease","medication","RT-PCR","questionnaires","radiologic findings","education","nasopharyngeal swabs","fever","cough","years","electronic medical records","information","initial symptom","Objective","Results","comprehensive ophthalmological guidance","diseases","foreign body sensation","fatigue","mean","SD","keratitis","cases","Conclusions","blurred vision","diabetic retinopathy","Wuhan","China","pandemic","world","cataract","Methods","control"],"language":"en"},

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P \u003C 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P \u003C 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P \u003C 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P \u003C 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8\u002B T cell count, CD4\u002B T cell count, and so on.

Serums from 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were employed to evaluate the performance of this approach. Compared to the IgM testing, the IgG testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 SARS-CoV-2 infections from the 79 confirmed patients and only two false-positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specificity reaching 82.28% and 97.5%, respectively. However, only a slight difference (not statistically significant) in the detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed between the IgM and IgG testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease. A performance comparison between an ELISA kit using the same nucleocapsid antigen and our chemiluminescence method was undertaken. The same false-positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group, while ELISA kit can only detect half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections from paired SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients group than that of the chemiluminescence method, indicating a higher performance for the chemiluminescence-immunoassay approach.

Therefore, the development of COVID-19 testing kits is still an open area of research. Recently, many studies have shown that chest Computed Tomography(CT) images can be used for COVID-19 testing, as chest CT images show a bilateral change in COVID-19 infected patients. However, the classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images is not an easy task as predicting the bilateral change is defined as an ill-posed problem. Therefore, in this paper, a deep transfer learning technique is used to classify COVID-19 infected patients. Additionally, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive attributes is also utilized to handle noisy and imbalanced COVID-19 dataset kind of problems. Experimental results reveal that the proposed deep transfer learning-based COVID-19 classification model provides efficient results as compared to the other supervised learning models.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pathak, Yadunath; Shukla, Prashant Kumar; Tiwari, Akhilesh; Stalin, Shalini; Singh, Saurabh; Shukla, Piyush Kumar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cc75345daf2797ed0e5e642bf2eb7fc77d18ee0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1959031820300993; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1959031820300993?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classification of COVID","imbalanced COVID","development of COVID","chest CT images","proposed deep transfer learning-based COVID","infected patients","bilateral change","deep transfer learning technique","chest Computed Tomography","supervised learning models","availability of limited number of testing kits","classification model","efficient results","Experimental results","easy task","cost-sensitive attributes","smooth loss function","dataset kind of problems","paper","rapid rate","open area of research","ill-posed problem","studies","infection"],"language":"en"},

Eleven single-layer materials met the standard of pressure difference ([\u2264]49 Pa), of which 3 met the standard of resistance to surface wetting ([\u2265]3), 1 met the standard of particle filtration efficiency ([\u2265]30%), but none met the standard of bacterial filtration efficiency ([\u2265]95%). Based on the testing results of single-layer materials, fifteen combinations of paired materials were tested. The results showed that three double-layer materials including double-layer medical non-woven fabric, medical non-woven fabric plus non-woven shopping bag, and medical non-woven fabric plus granular tea towel could meet all the standards of pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, and resistance to surface wetting, and were close to the standard of the bacterial filtration efficiency. In conclusion, if resources are severely lacking and medical masks cannot be obtained, homemade masks using available materials, based on the results of this study, can minimize the chance of infection to the maximum extent.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, D.; You, Y.; Zhou, X.; Zong, Z.; Huang, H.; Zhang, H.; Yong, X.; Cheng, Y.; Yang, L.; Guo, Q.; Long, Y.; Liu, Y.; Huang, J.; Du, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20093021v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["standard of particle filtration efficiency","standard of bacterial filtration efficiency","medical masks","standard of resistance","double-layer materials","single-layer materials","available materials","alternative materials","standard of pressure difference","homemade masks","double-layer medical non-woven fabric","shortage of masks","national standard","combinations of paired materials","wetting","non-woven shopping bag","standards of pressure difference","Surgical Mask","testing results of single","severe mask shortage","key indicators","droplet transmission","significant performance indicators","main route of transmission","granular tea towel","chance of infection","maximum extent","crucial preventive measure","China","resources","Coronavirus Disease","COVID","world","high mortality","study","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital, and Tongji Hosptial in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS A pooled derivation cohort of 1008 COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital in Wuhan and an external validation cohort of 1031 patients from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event. Fine-Gray models, using backward elimination for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear effects of continuous variables, were used to derive a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Internal validation was implemented to check model overfitting using bootstrap approach. External validation to a separate hospital was implemented to evaluate the generalizability of the model. RESULTS The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1008, 43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (n=1031, 47.8% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted survival curves were close to the observed survival curves across patients with different risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS The PLANS model based on the five routinely collected demographic and clinical characteristics (platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex) showed excellent discriminative and calibration accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. This prognostic model would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Chen, S.; Wang, S.; Zhang, D.; Wang, J.; Postmus, D.; Zeng, H.; Qin, G.; Shen, Y.; Jiang, J.; Yu, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20100370v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tongji Hospital"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["hospital mortality","Union Hospital","Tongji Hospital","separate hospital","prognostic model","SETTING Jinyintan Hospital","model overfitting","PLANS model","external validation cohort","lymphocyte count","neutrophil count","final model","Internal validation","better triaging patients","predictor variables of platelet count","Wuhan","median age","independent cohort","severe hospitalized COVID","pooled derivation cohort","excellent predictive performance","retrospective cohort study","averaged calibration slope","sex","inclusion of predictor variables","calibration accuracy","clinical characteristics","predicting","China","averaged predicted survival curves","observed survival curves","Tongji Hosptial","optimism-adjusted C-index","non-linear effects of continuous variables","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome","little overfitting","backward elimination","healthcare resources","different risk profiles","clinicians","Fine-Gray models","DESIGN Multicenter","females","competing event","case","PARTICIPANTS","bootstrap approach","fatality","CONCLUSIONS","generalizability","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Although some patients meet the diagnostic criteria for the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, the pathogenesis of the diffuse thrombotic status remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in sera of deceased patients with autoptic proven thrombotic microangiopathy to evaluate if some patients may have developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS). Methods Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The available medical history, comorbidities, therapies, laboratory and autopsy findings were collected post-mortem from clinical records. IgA, IgG and IgM anti cardiolipin (ACA) and anti {beta}2 glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1) antibodies, IgG and IgM anti phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) antibodies were tested for all the patients. Results 3/35 (8.6%) patients were slightly positive for aPL: one for ACA IgG and two for ACA IgM but values were low (\u003C 3X the cut off). No patients tested positive for ACA IgA neither for {beta}2GP1 isotypes. 3/35 (8.6%) patients were positive for PS/PT, one for IgG and two for IgM, but values were less than 2X the cut off. No patients showed simultaneous positivity for ACA and PS/ PT. Conclusions It is difficult to categorize the vascular events into a conventional disease: we did not find significant association with anti-phospholipid antibodies. It is most likely that several factors contribute to trigger the hypercoagulability status and the thromboembolism but, on the basis our results, CAPS is probably not involved into the pathogenesis of these phenomena.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Previtali, G.; Seghezzi, M.; Moioli, V.; Sonzogni, A.; Marozzi, R.; Cerutti, L.; Ravasio, R.; Gianatti, A.; Guerra, G.; Alessio, M.

Using country-level data, we modeled the early growth in the number of cases for over 480 cities in all Brazilian states. As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19. Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city- and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. Moreover, we reinforce that social distancing protocols are fundamental to avoid critical scenarios and the collapse of healthcare systems. We also predict that economic-induced decisions for relaxing social distancing might have catastrophic consequences, especially in large cities.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baumgartner, M.

While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19\u002B patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corley, Michael J.; Sugai, Christopher; Schotsaert, Michael; Schwartz, Robert E.; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/156ff08ad386e2d9f7699b3fa68104fb8c5b37f5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.039263","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ","PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of HCQ","HCQ transcriptome signatures","SARS-CoV","setting of COVID","host signatures of COVID","underlying mechanisms of HCQ","HCQ-related transcriptional changes","confirmed COVID","immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment","macrophage HCQ-related gene lists","bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID","host genes","differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure","transcriptional signatures","restoration of SARS","gene set","PBMC","infection","CXCL6 gene","related host transcriptional responses","impacted transcription","treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","A549 cells","infected patients","postmortem lung biopsies","infected NHBE","chemokine activity","transcriptome data","favor of chemokine modulation","human primary monocyte-derived macrophages","cholesterol biosynthetic process","controversial antiviral candidate therapy","evidence","immune regulation","insight","lipid metabolism","hours of","participants","panacea","clinical trials","results","Hydroxychloroquine"],"language":"en"},

Treatment of glioma models in vitro and in vivo with \u03B2 adrenergic agonists variably amplifies or attenuates cellular proliferation. In the majority of in vivo models, \u03B2 adrenergic agonists generally reduce cellular proliferation. However, treatment with \u03B2 adrenergic agonists consistently reduces tumor cell invasive potential, angiogenesis, and metastasis. \u03B2 adrenergic agonists induced decreases of invasive potential are chiefly mediated through reductions in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases types 2 and 9. Treatment with \u03B2 adrenergic agonists also clearly reduce tumoral neoangiogenesis, which may represent a putatively useful mechanism to adjuvantly amplify the effects of bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. We may accordingly designate \u03B2agonists to represent an enhancer of bevacizumab. The antiangiogenic effects of \u03B2 adrenergic agonists may thus effectively render an otherwise borderline effective therapy to generate significant enhancement in clinical outcomes. \u03B2 adrenergic agonists upregulate expression of the major histocompatibility class II DR alpha gene, effectively potentiating the immunogenicity of tumor cells to tumor surveillance mechanisms. Authors have also demonstrated crossmodal modulation of signaling events downstream from the \u03B2 adrenergic cell surface receptor and microtubular polymerization and depolymerization. Complex effects and desensitization mechanisms of the \u03B2 adrenergic signaling may putatively represent promising therapeutic targets. Constant stimulation of the \u03B2 adrenergic receptor induces its phosphorylation by \u03B2 adrenergic receptor kinase (\u03B2ARK), rendering it a suitable substrate for alternate binding by \u03B2 arrestins 1 or 2. The binding of a \u03B2 arrestin to \u03B2ARK phosphorylated \u03B2AR promotes receptor mediated internalization and downregulation of cell surface receptor and contemporaneously generates a cell surface scaffold at the \u03B2AR. The scaffold mediated activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2, compared with protein kinase A mediated activation, preferentially favors cytosolic retention of ERK1/2 and blunting of nuclear translocation and ensuant pro-transcriptional activity. Thus, \u03B2AR desensitization and consequent scaffold assembly effectively retains the cytosolic homeostatic functions of ERK1/2 while inhibiting its pro-proliferative effects.

TRAF3 negatively regulates the activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03BAB pathways and is one of the key proteins in antiviral immunity. Scope of Review: Here we provide a structural overview of TRAF3 signaling in terms of its competitive binding and consequences to the cellular network. For completion, we also include molecular mimicry of TRAF3 physiological partners by some viral proteins. Major Conclusions: By out-competing host partners, viral proteins aim to subvert TRAF3 antiviral action. Mechanistically, dynamic, competitive binding by the organism\u0027s own proteins and same-site adaptive pathogen mimicry follow the same conformational selection principles. General Significance: Our premise is that irrespective of the eliciting event \u2013 physiological or acquired pathogenic trait \u2013 pathway activation (or suppression) may embrace similar conformational principles. However, even though here we largely focus on competitive binding at a shared site, similar to physiological signaling other pathogen subversion mechanisms can also be at play.

Coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses discovered in bats, which were considered as the natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses, i.e. SARS-COV and MERS-CoV. Our previous study reported the discovery of a bat-derived putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus with a reovirus gene p10, named as Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. In this report, through a two-year follow-up of a special bat population in one specific cave of south China, we illustrate that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 persistently circulates among bats. Notably, through the longitudinal observation, we identified the dynamic evolution of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 in bats represented by continuously recombination events. Our study provides the first glimpse of the virus evolution in one longitudinally observed bat population cohort and underlines the surveillance and pre-warning of potential interspecies transmittable viruses in bats.","publish_time":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Obameso, Joseph O.; Li, Hong; Jia, Hao; Han, Min; Zhu, Shiyan; Huang, Canping; Zhao, Yuhui; Zhao, Min; Bai, Yu; Yuan, Fei; Zhao, Honglan; Peng, Xia; Xu, Wen; Tan, Wenjie; Zhao, Yingze; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Liu, William J.; Lu, Lin; Gao, George F.","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59464b52dabfa2a7e0b9aad6f72f5b3505a562ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-017-9263-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bats","Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1","human population","special bat population","bat population cohort","re-emerging viruses","dynamic evolution of Ro","common viruses","SARS-COV","virus evolution","MERS-CoV","previous study","pre-warning of potential interspecies transmittable viruses","natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses","bat-derived putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus","surveillance","reovirus gene p10","specific cave of south China","discovery","two-year follow-up","increasing numbers of emerging","species barrier","glimpse","longitudinal observation","recombination events","report"],"language":"en"},

Closer collaboration with engineers has allowed clinical microbiologists, virologists and infection control teams to assess the effectiveness of hospital isolation and ventilation facilities. The characteristics of human respiratory activities have also been investigated using some familiar engineering techniques. Such studies aim to enhance the effectiveness of such preventive measures and have included experiments with human-like mannequins using various tracer gas/particle techniques, real human volunteers with real-time non-invasive Schlieren imaging, numerical modelling using computational fluid dynamics, and small scale physical analogues with water.

The purpose of this paper is to establish service industries as increasingly significant aspects of urban development within the Asia-Pacific, and to propose a conceptual and analytical framework for scholarly investigation within this important research domain. To this end the paper explores a sequence of related themes and issues, concerning the larger developmental implications of urban services growth (or tertiarization), the facets of urban transformation associated with tertiarization, and a preliminary typology of urban service functions which acknowledges the rich diversity of service vocations and stages of development within the Asia-Pacific. The paper concludes that \u201Cadvanced services\u201D\u2014specialized, intermediate service industries, advanced-technology services, and creative service industries\u2014will be quite crucial to the development of city-regions within the Asia-Pacific, with respect to employment growth and human capital formation, to the urban economic (or export) base, to the operation of flexible production systems, and to competitive advantage. The development of these urban service poles will require innovative policy commitments and regulatory adjustments, as will the multi-centred specialized urban service corridors which function as engines of regional economic growth, and which provide platforms for national modernization and responses to the pressures (and opportunities) of globalization. To date, urban and regional development strategies for service industries within the Asia-Pacific have privileged globalization, industrial restructuring, and modernization aims, but there is also an encouraging record of more progressive planning experimentation in some jurisdictions, incorporating principles of sustainability and co-operative development. There is also increasing interest in policies to support cultural and creative industries among Asia-Pacific city-regions, informed by some recent urban policy experimentation in this domain. These experiences can offer models for further policy and programmatic innovation in the 21st century, as service industries continue to play larger roles in urban and regional development within the Asia-Pacific.","publish_time":"2003-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutton, Thomas A","journal":"Progress in Planning","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9d8cce8eecf0ca8c2ecc07e57b1fb54d97a279b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127207.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305900603000138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305900603000138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287934/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0305-9006(03)00013-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Asia-Pacific"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of Asia","urban service poles","creative service industries","intermediate service industries","development of city","instruments of urban growth","significant aspects of urban development","Asia-Pacific city-regions","preliminary typology of urban service functions","creative industries","stages of development","co-operative development","multi-centred specialized urban service corridors","facets of urban transformation","recent urban policy experimentation","regional development strategies","Pacific states","larger developmental implications of urban services growth","rich diversity of service vocations","paper","advanced services","employment growth","engines of regional economic growth","advanced-technology services","tertiarization","innovative policy commitments","important research domain","larger roles","privileged globalization","national modernization","past half-century","progressive planning experimentation","scholarly investigation","human capital formation","issues","respect","regulatory adjustments","operation of flexible production systems","responses","jurisdictions","pressures","base","platforms","industrial restructuring","analytical framework","principles of sustainability","sequence of related themes","encouraging record","models","programmatic innovation","export","date","competitive advantage","industralization programmes","opportunities","policies","change","experiences","purpose"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the molecular protein profile of this devastating virus. This work represents a thorough bioinformatics analysis of the regularities of charge distribution (polar profiles) in two groups of proteins and their functional domains associated with Ebola virus disease: Ebola virus proteins and Human proteins interacting with Ebola virus. Our analysis reveals that a fragment exists in each of these proteins\u2014one named the \u201Cfunctional domain\u201D\u2014with the polar profile similar to the polar profile of the protein that contains it. Each protein is formed by a group of short sub-sequences, where each fragment has a different and distinctive polar profile and where the polar profile between adjacent short sub-sequences changes orderly and gradually to coincide with the polar profile of the whole protein. When using the charge distribution as a metric, it was observed that it effectively discriminates the proteins from their functional domains.

Because the MERS-CoV risk-standardized mortality rates are currently unavailable in the literature, the author concentrated on developing a method to estimate the risk-standardized mortality rates using MERS-CoV 3- and 30-day mortality measures. METHODS: MERS-CoV data in Saudi Arabia is publicly reported and made available through the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) website. The author studied 660 MERS-CoV patients who were reported by the SMOH between December 2, 2014 and November 12, 2016. The data gathered contained basic demographic information (age, gender, and nationality), healthcare worker, source of infection, pre-existing illness, symptomatic, severity of illness, and regions in Saudi Arabia. The status and date of mortality were also reported. Cox-proportional hazard (CPH) models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios for the predictors of 3- and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 3-day, 30-day, and overall mortality were found to be 13.8%, 28.3%, and 29.8%, respectively. According to CPH, multivariate predictors of 3-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, illness severity, and hospital-acquired infections (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =1.7; 8.8; 6.5; and 2.8, respectively). Multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing illness, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections (aHR =1.7; 19.2; 2.1; 3.7; and 2.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors were identified that could influence mortality outcomes at 3 days and 30 days, including age (elderly), non-healthcare workers, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections. The findings can serve as a guide for healthcare practitioners by appropriately identifying and managing potential patients at high risk of death.","publish_time":"2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92219161c16ed7c1719549677c40a821fbb54853.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5594447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893197/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2712-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Saudi Ministry of Health","CPH"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["day mortality measures","mortality outcomes","date of mortality","overall mortality","severity of illness","illness severity","MERS-CoV risk-standardized mortality rates","MERS-CoV patients","pre-existing illness","non-healthcare workers","MERS-CoV data","healthcare practitioners","healthcare systems","elderly","hospital","infections","Saudi Arabia","multivariate predictors","mortality rate of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","age","potential patients","days","hazard ratios","CPH","author","aHR","SMOH","high risk of death","Saudi Ministry of Health","adjusted hazard ratio","Cox-proportional hazard","gender","source of infection","basic demographic information","nationality","major challenge","models","regions","website","literature","guide","BACKGROUND","METHODS","factors","status","CONCLUSIONS","findings","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs recorded in non-English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese. Methods We propose a novel Chinese CC classification system leveraging a Chinese-English translation module and an existing English CC classification approach. A set of 470 Chinese key phrases was extracted from about one million Chinese CC records using statistical methods. Based on the extracted key phrases, the system translates Chinese text into English and classifies the translated CCs to syndromic categories using an existing English CC classification system. Results Compared to alternative approaches using a bilingual dictionary and a general-purpose machine translation system, our approach performs significantly better in terms of positive predictive value (PPV or precision), sensitivity (recall), specificity, and F measure (the harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity), based on a computational experiment using real-world CC records. Conclusions Our design provides satisfactory performance in classifying Chinese CCs into syndromic categories for public health surveillance. The overall design of our system also points out a potentially fruitful direction for multilingual CC systems that need to handle languages beyond English and Chinese.","publish_time":"2009-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Hsin-Min; Chen, Hsinchun; Zeng, Daniel; King, Chwan-Chuen; Shih, Fuh-Yuan; Wu, Tsung-Shu; Hsiao, Jin-Yi","journal":"International Journal of Medical Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0429e5b02e2579de8c97e5874a218a455d906780.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108263.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.08.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505608001524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18838292/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505608001524","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CC","PPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chinese CCs","Chinese CC records","novel Chinese CC classification system","existing English CC classification system","Chinese text","existing English CC classification approach","existing CC classification systems","automated syndromic surveillance","multilingual CC classification effort","multilingual CC systems","Chinese-English translation module","Chinese key phrases","predefined syndromic categories","real-world CC records","processing CCs","translated CCs","Abstract Purpose Syndromic surveillance","public health surveillance","general-purpose machine translation system","sensitivity","non-English languages","extracted key phrases","different languages","international effort","statistical methods","overall design","subsequent data aggregation","harmonic mean of PPV","important data source","free-text chief complaints","bilingual dictionary","precision","adequate support","satisfactory performance","F measure","terms of positive predictive value","computational experiment","fruitful direction","early detection of disease outbreaks","alternative approaches","specificity","recall","paper","Conclusions","analysis","set","Results"],"language":"en"},

In this paper we exploit Answer Set Programming to formalize and reason about uncertainty expressed as belief orders. The availability of ASP-solvers supports the design of automated tools to handle such formalizations. Our proposal reveals particularly suitable whenever the domain of discernment is partial.

However, the involvement of type-I transmembrane glycoprotein CD147/EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) in the antiviral response to HCMV infection is still unknown. Here, we demonstrated the specific knockdown of CD147 significantly decreased HCMV-induced activation of NF-\u03BAB and Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03B2), which contribute to the cellular antiviral responses. Next, we confirmed that HCMV-encoded miR-US25-1-5p could target the 3\u2032 UTR (Untranslated Region) of CD147 mRNA, and thus facilitate HCMV lytic propagation at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). The expression and secretion of Cyclophilin A (sCyPA), as a ligand for CD147 and a proinflammatory cytokine, were up-regulated in response to HCMV stimuli. Finally, we confirmed that CD147 mediated HCMV-triggered antiviral signaling via the sCyPA-CD147-ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinases)/NF-\u03BAB axis signaling pathway. These findings reveal an important HCMV mechanism for evading antiviral innate immunity through its encoded microRNA by targeting transmembrane glycoprotein CD147, and a potential cause of HCMV inflammatory disorders due to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine CyPA.","publish_time":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jun; Xia, Sisi; Yang, Xiangmin; Chen, Huizi; Li, Fanni; Liu, Fenyong; Chen, Zhinan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19eed2e91c17ea20e9cbda665e19fad13a948ecf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5744140.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9120365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29194430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","Cyclophilin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV infection","HCMV stimuli","CD147 mediated HCMV-triggered antiviral","sCyPA-CD147","CD147 mRNA","transmembrane glycoprotein CD147","important HCMV mechanism","HCMV lytic propagation","HCMV-induced activation of NF","HCMV-encoded miR-US25","specific knockdown of CD147","potential cause of HCMV inflammatory disorders","cellular antiviral responses","antiviral innate immunity","secretion of proinflammatory cytokine CyPA","initial immune response","NF-\u03BAB axis","low multiplicity of infection","extracellular regulated protein kinases","encoded microRNA","secretion of Cyclophilin","Cellular receptor","extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer","EMMPRIN","ERK","Human Cytomegalovirus","critical roles","Interferon-beta","pathways","UTR","Untranslated Region","ligand","IFN-\u03B2","involvement of type","MOI","findings","expression"],"language":"en"},

This paper presents an empirical spatio-temporal analysis of epidemiological data concerning 2321 SARS-infected patients in Beijing in 2003. We mapped the SARS morbidity data with the spatial data resolution at the level of street and township. Two smoothing methods, Bayesian adjustment and spatial smoothing, were applied to identify the spatial risks and spatial transmission trends. Furthermore, we explored various spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolution of Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic using spatial statistics such as Moran\u2019s I and LISA. Part of this study is targeted at evaluating the effectiveness of public health control measures implemented during the SARS epidemic. The main findings are as follows. (1) The diffusion speed of SARS in the northwest-southeast direction is weaker than that in northeast-southwest direction. (2) SARS\u2019s spread risk is positively spatially associated and the strength of this spatial association has experienced changes from weak to strong and then back to weak during the lifetime of the Beijing SARS epidemic. (3) Two spatial clusters of disease cases are identified: one in the city center and the other in the eastern suburban area. These two clusters followed different evolutionary paths but interacted with each other as well. (4) Although the government missed the opportunity to contain the early outbreak of SARS in March 2003, the response strategies implemented after the mid of April were effective. These response measures not only controlled the growth of the disease cases, but also mitigated the spatial diffusion.","publish_time":"2010-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, ZhiDong; Zeng, DaJun; Zheng, XiaoLong; Wang, QuanYi; Wang, FeiYue; Wang, JinFeng; Wang, XiaoLi","journal":"Sci China Earth Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8bd2cfcb88cc07c4dff5e8e79c481580cccb395.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-010-0043-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288761/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moran","LISA"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["spatial smoothing","spatial diffusion","spatial statistics","spatial association","spatial risks","spatial data resolution","Beijing SARS epidemic","spatial clusters of disease cases","SARS morbidity data","various spatial patterns","spatial transmission trends","diffusion speed of SARS","SARS-infected patients","early outbreak of SARS","response measures","spatio-temporal evolution of Beijing","public health response","spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics","empirical spatio-temporal analysis of epidemiological data","prevention measures","response strategies","effectiveness of public health control measures","smoothing methods","northwest-southeast direction","northeast-southwest direction","modeling support","important aspects of interaction","environment","people","Bayesian adjustment","infectious diseases","useful insights","level of street","changes","Moran\u2019s","growth","lifetime","opportunity","different evolutionary paths","paper","eastern suburban area","township","LISA","strength","city center","main findings","SARS\u2019s","government","study"],"language":"en"},

This study is to investigate the association between viral load in children with human adenovirus (HAdV) pneumonia and disease severity. METHODS: A total of 1313 cases of children hospitalized in Hunan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital due to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from April 2011 to May 2014 were enrolled in this study. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected for the cohort. WHO criteria for CAP grading was emerged for pneumonia severity classification. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect 12 kinds of respiratory viruses. HAdV types were identified by nested PCR. The relationship between HAdV load and severity of disease was there by analyzed. RESULTS: Finally, 174 cases (174/1313, 13.3%) were positive for HAdV, and HAdV type 7 (HAdV-7) was the main serotype (76/174, 43.7%). Among the 174 cases, 70 cases were with HAdV infection alone and 104 cases were accompanied by other viruses. The patients were divided into mild pneumonia group (n = 108 cases) and severe pneumonia group (n = 66 cases). HAdV load of children in severe pneumonia group was higher than that in mild pneumonia group. Similar result was obtained in the 70 cases with HAdV infection alone after subgrouping. Relevant factors analysis results showed that severe pneumonia children presented lower onset age, more prone to fever, longer fever time, and longer hospital stay compared with that of mild pneumonia children. Children with HAdV-7 infection developed more frequently severe pneumonia. Multivariate regression analysis showed that HAdV load, age, and fever time were risk factors for pneumonia severity.

HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Shirley; Wylie, Todd N.; Wylie, Kristine M.; Johnson, Gayle C.; Skidmore, Zachary L.; Fleer, Maren; Griffith, Obi L.; Bryan, Jeffrey N.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea800dcdcf09ab648a3229d2f1e02159877a4f53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117531.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519309198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31902496/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519309198; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108491","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","FOSCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FOSCC samples","feline papillomavirus","normal feline oral mucosa","feline foamy virus","normal oral mucosa","DNA viruses","HPV-negative HNSCC","feline torque teno virus","Abstract Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma","HPV-positive cancers","RNA viruses","human papillomavirus","negative cancers","ViroCap","Epstein-Barr virus","neck squamous cell carcinoma","known vertebrate DNA","Felis catus papillomavirus","suspected PV positive control samples","known sequences","detection of PVs","uncommon role","model of human head","species-nonspecific PCR primers","targeted capture","metagenomic approach","generation sequencing tool","causative agent","best","virome","Previous studies","environmental causes","study","Future research","hypothesis","FIV","alphaherpesvirus"],"language":"en"},

A better understanding of unmet symptom management needs will allow researchers to design interventions that are more reflective of deficits in care and more effective at improving patient care. Few studies have focused on unmet needs for symptom management in PLWHA particularly in China. Factors influencing Chinese PLWHA symptom management needs are rarely discussed. Aim The purpose of this study was to investigate the unmet needs for symptom management of PLWHA and how their symptom burden, HIV perceived stigma, and self-management capacity contributes to HIV-related self-management practices in Shanghai, China. Design Study participants were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient HIV/AIDS wards in an infectious hospital in Shanghai, China. Self-administered questionnaires were implemented and medical charts were reviewed. Results A total of 367 participants was recruited from April to September 2017. The results show that 53.1% (195 of 367) of participants presented at least one unmet symptom management need and that symptom burden, as well as perceived stigma, reduced self-management capacity, and no employment significantly affected unmet symptom management needs. Conclusion The findings indicate that there is room for improvement in symptom management for Chinese PLWHA. Culturally appropriate interventions focusing on improving symptom burden, decreasing HIV perceived stigma, and enhancing self-management capacity can enhance symptom management in this population.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Ning; Chen, Wei-Ti; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhu, Zheng; Hu, Yan; Bao, Meijuan","journal":"Applied nursing research : ANR","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03da406a940e4a1e340f47f525da7a88d573adb9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0897189719305294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425335/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2020.151283; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0897189719305294?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","HIV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["symptom management of PLWHA","symptom burden","Chinese PLWHA symptom management needs","self-management capacity","better understanding of unmet symptom management needs","unmet needs","HIV-related self-management practices","HIV perceived stigma","inpatient HIV","China","Design Study participants","Shanghai","results","AIDS wards","appropriate interventions","patient care","employment","outpatient","infectious hospital","vulnerable group","improvement","researchers","Factors","room","Abstract Background People","psychological symptoms","reflective of deficits","Self-administered questionnaires","medical charts","findings","studies","population","Conclusion","purpose","total"],"language":"en"},

Flavivirus infections underlie multiple human diseases and thus exert an immense burden on public health worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that host autophagy is subverted to modulate the life cycles of flaviviruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The diverse interplay between autophagy and flavivirus infection not only regulates viral growth in host cells but also counteracts host stress responses induced by viral infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of autophagy in the flavivirus life cycle. We also discuss the impacts of virus-induced autophagy on the pathogeneses of flavivirus-associated diseases and the potential use of autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flavivirus infections and related human diseases.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ke, Po-Yuan","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d7027f9c0c85c6aad1c9459d1c16f2b3b918280.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6321027.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19123940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host autophagy","induced autophagy","dengue virus","Zika virus","impacts of virus","role of autophagy","pathogeneses of flavivirus","Japanese encephalitis virus","West Nile virus","hepatitis C virus","curing flavivirus infections","potential use of autophagy","flavivirus life cycle","associated diseases","related human diseases","multiple human diseases","host cells","viral infection","host stress responses","viral growth","life cycles of flaviviruses","therapeutic target","nutrients","organelle biogenesis","lysosomal degradation","intracellular components","immense burden","metabolic homeostasis","current knowledge","cellular process","diverse interplay","public health","Mounting evidence"],"language":"en"},

This disease is caused by a novel single-stranded enveloped RNA virus, known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although huge efforts are being made to produce effective therapies to combat this disease, it continues to be one of the greatest challenges in medicine. There is no doubt that herpesviruses are one of the most important viruses that infect humans and animals, and infections induced by these pathogens have developed into a great threat to public health. According to the currently available evidence, the correlation between herpesviruses and coronaviruses is limited to the induced complications following the infections. For instance, the inflammation that is induced at the sites of infection could tie these viruses to each other in a relationship. Another example, bovine herpesvirus 1, which is an important pathogen of cattle, can cause a severe respiratory infection; the same way in which SARS-CoV-2 affects humans. Considering the current circumstances related to the COVID-19 crisis, this editorial paper, which belongs to the Special Issue \u0022Recent Advances in Herpesviruses Research: What\u0027s in the Pipeline?\u0022 aims to draw attention to some natural anti-herpesvirus alkaloid compounds, which have recently been proven to have excellent inhibitory efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specific antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids. METHODS: Hospitalized adults who tested positive for RSV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on admission had respiratory samples collected for quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine analysis. Serum and nasal secretions were tested for RSV antibody and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-three of 50 (66%) patients hospitalized with RSV received systemic steroids for a mean duration of 11 days. Those who received steroids more frequently wheezed and were less often febrile. There were no serious adverse events related to steroids and no significant differences in peak viral load, duration of RSV shedding, nasal cytokines, or lymphocyte subsets in patients treated with steroids and patients untreated with steroids. Antibody responses to RSV were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Short courses of systemic steroids in patients hospitalized with RSV infection did not affect viral load or shedding. Humoral immunity may be mildly diminished, and thus potential benefits of systemic steroids must be balanced against potential risks.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, F.

More than 9,00,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 47,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications for the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses. Significance The infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe respiratory disease with pneumonia-like symptoms in humans is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. No in-depth information on structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is currently available in the public domain, and no effective anti-viral drugs and/or vaccines are designed for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides the first comparative analysis of the order- and disorder-based features of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome relative to human SARS and bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giri, Rajanish; Bhardwaj, Taniya; Shegane, Meenakshi; Gehi, Bhuvaneshwari R.; Kumar, Prateek; Gadhave, Kundlik; Oldfield, Christopher J.; Uversky, Vladimir N.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b1d3cd2210cdb4bb41a1af294cf02bd04f58525.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","bat SARS","functions of SARS","cases of SARS","bat CoV","human SARS CoVs","dark proteomes of SARS","non-structural biology of SARS","vast majority of SARS","well-studied Human SARS coronavirus","viral proteins","novel coronavirus","Wuhan coronavirus","emerged coronavirus","infection","causative agent of coronavirus disease","disorder-based features","disordered protein regions","intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites","current COVID","disordered regions","proteome relative","bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","prevalence of intrinsic disorder","severe respiratory disease","viral infectivity","IDPRs","study","pandemic","World Health Organization","effective anti-viral drugs","cleavage sites","structure-based drug discovery","public domain","significant levels of structural order","important implications","global public health emergency","associated mortalities","molecular recognition features","replicase","humans","symptoms","pneumonia","ORF6","MoRFs","structures","set of complementary computational approaches","Nsp8","vaccines","ab polyprotein","nCoV","in-depth information","comparative analysis","multiple sequence alignment data","numbers","Nucleocapsid","extensive investigation","example","specific partners","evolution","reports","article","passing hour","results","fact","treatment","pathogenicity","Significance","findings","coronaviruses","writing"],"language":"en"},

Methods: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. Results: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299/3028) were positive for COVID-19.

The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31/87), hypertension (37%, 32/87), and diabetes (24%, 24/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. Conclusions and Relevance: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions. If further validated on additional cohorts of patients, this model/clinical tool may provide useful prognostication of critical care needs.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, D.

The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, comparing to the SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2 from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2 from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xuesen; Chen, Danying; Szabla, Robert; Zheng, Mei; Li, Guoli; Du, Pengcheng; Zheng, Shuangli; Li, Xinglin; Song, Chuan; Li, Rui; Guo, Ju-Tao; Junop, Murray; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9afbf9b4e00265c655017c6adeb6b8acdeca59bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.048710","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","human ACE2","ACE2 of human","receptor activity of ACE2","furin cleavage site deficient S protein of SARS","amplifying animal hosts of SARS","S1 subunit of SARS","animal transmission","human population","Receptor recognition","lowest receptor activity","potential natural reservoirs","multiple species","mammal species","remaining species","animal models","polybasic furin cleavage site","zoonotic transmission","pseudotyped virus infection","tissue tropism","wild-type","major determinant of host range","mouse","spike","unprecedented global public health","economy crisis","rat","important implications","rhesus monkey","causal agent","infectious entry of lentiviral particles","pandemic","emergence","rabbit","bats","pangolins","pathogenesis of coronaviruses","origin","findings","CoVs","effort","glycoprotein","cells","COVID"],"language":"en"},

During the pandemic, local governments in China implemented different interventions to efficiently control the spread of the epidemic. Characterizing transmission of COVID-19 under some typical interventions is to help countries develop appropriate interventions. Methods We established compartmental model that allowed the number of infected and infectious to be unknown and the effective reproduction number to change over time, thus the effects of policies could be reasonably reflected and estimated. By using the epidemic data of three representative cities of China (Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen), we migrated the estimated policy modes to other countries. Results The smallest expected cumulative confirmed cases under different interventions would be 5936 with 95% CI (5012,6966) for South Korea, 146012 with 95% CI (140504, 154264) for Italy, and 400642 with 95% CI (390331,409431) for the United States until May 31, 2020, respectively.

The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%\uFF5E19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%\uFF5E96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%\uFF5E16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%\uFF5E96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated.

Aim: Since apparent differences were noted in the disease transmission between the two South East Asian countries of India and Thailand, the study aims to draw comparative account of the progression of COVID 19 in near future between these two countries. Methods: The study used data of COVID 19 confirmed cases in India and Thailand from WHO COVID 19 situation reports during the time period between 25th March, 2020 and 14th May, 2020. After determination of stationarity in the data and differencing, observation of autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (2,2,1) model was used to forecast the COVID 19 confirmed cases in both these countries for two weeks (i.e. 28th May, 2020). IBM SPSS version 20.0 software was used for data analysis. Results: The study demonstrated a possible increasing trend in number of COVID 19 cases in India in the coming two weeks with an estimated point forecast of 1,28,772 (95% CI 115023 to 142520) by 28th May, 2020. A stationary phase was forecasted for Thailand with a difference of only 43 cases between 14th May (the last case of input data) and 28th May. Conclusion: The time series forecasting employed in the present study warrants thorough preparation on part of the Indian health care system and authorities and calls for caution with regard to decisions made on lifting the control measures. The difference in the time series forecasting between these two South East Asian countries also highlights the need for strengthening of public health systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandu, V.

However, these measures are not without cost, and careful analysis is critical to quantify their impact on disease spread and guide future initiatives. This study aims to measure the impact of NPIs on the effective reproductive number (Rt) and other COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. states. Methods: In order to standardize the stage of disease spread in each state, this study analyzes the weeks immediately after each state reached 500 cases. The primary outcomes were average Rt in the week following 500 cases and doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases. Linear and logistic regressions were performed in R to assess the impact of various NPIs while controlling for population density, GDP, and certain health metrics. This analysis was repeated for deaths with doubling time from 50 to 100 deaths and included several healthcare infrastructure control variables. Results: States that had a stay-at-home order in place at the time of their 500th case are associated with lower average Rt the following week compared to states without a stay-at-home order (p \u003C 0.001) and are significantly less likely to have an Rt\u003E1 (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.37, p = 0.004). These states also experienced a significantly longer doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72, p = 0.004). States in the highest quartile of average time spent at home were also slower to reach 1000 cases than those in the lowest quartile (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.53, p = 0.002). Discussion: Few studies have analyzed the effect of statewide stay-at-home orders, school closures, and other social distancing measures in the U.S., which has faced the largest COVID-19 case burden. States with stay-at-home orders have a 93% decrease in the odds of having a positive Rt at a standardized point in disease burden. States that plan to scale back such measures should carefully monitor transmission metrics.

Using this proposed index (snr), it was possible to carry out a data-driven comparison among different countries in their efforts of dealing with the crisis. The primary focus of this study was to assess the interventions\u0027 effectiveness by the decision makers along with the health system\u0027s efficiency of the countries that experienced a relatively high pressure on their systems. In this study, 19 countries were selected based on predefined criteria that included: (1) reported confirmed cases should exceed 5,000, and (2) confirmed cases per 1 million people should exceed 200, at the time this study was concluded. According to the proposed, snr index, the findings showed that Germany and South Korea were ahead of the game, compared to other countries such as the USA, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and UK. Some other countries, such as Canada, Austria, Switzerland managed to slightly pivot their interventions at a later stage in effective manners according to the snr index. The study explains the foundation, and the underlying calculations of the proposed, snr index. Moreover, the study shows how reliably the snr index measures the interventions\u0027 effectiveness and health system\u0027s efficiency during the crisis or during any health-related crisis. An additional, yet interesting finding from this study, was that the snr curve showed a persistent four-episode (segment) structure during the pandemic. This finding could suggest a benchmark of the expected pattern of the fight against the virus spread during the pandemic that could offer a significant tool, for the decision makers. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the implementation of this proposed index is only valid and meaningful during a crisis. In a none-crisis time, the required data to calculate the snr index is not available and rather mathematically misleading.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wahba, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5779b5742cafebb8806a2c3733ededb827648d35.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094334v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Germany","South Korea","Netherlands","Austria","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["snr index","proposed index","study","snr curve","health-related crisis","crisis time","health system\u0027s efficiency","different countries","interventions\u0027 effectiveness","decision makers","virus","pandemic","confirmed cases","required data","interesting finding","data-driven comparison","findings","effective manners","Belgium","Spain","noise ratio","underlying calculations","Netherlands","episode","Italy","South Korea","segment","later stage","USA","signal","Germany","significant tool","efforts","expected pattern","paper","benchmark","Switzerland","structure","fight","high pressure","Canada","Austria","game","foundation","implementation","systems","UK","stakeholders","predefined criteria","primary focus","attempt","people"],"language":"en"},

By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17st of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected. Based on the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), cumulated infections forecasts provided by the EDM applied to WR performed better across all scenarios than the Gompertz model. An exponential decay model applied to the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate appears to be useful in estimating the number of cases and peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and the model was more reliable in the exponential growth phase.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartolomeo, N.; Trerotoli, P.; Serio, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20108241v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EDM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["exponential decay model","Gompertz model","cumulative infections","WR","EDM","data available","outbreak","reported data","cumulative events","estimate","cumulated infections forecasts","exponential growth phase","cumulative number of infected","weighted average daily growth rate","peak date","COVID","Italy","number of cases","epidemic curve","final epidemic size","credibility interval","confirmed cases","short-term forecast","average mean absolute percentage error","MAPE","paper","basis","Hubei Province of China","official counts","novel coronavirus","performance","scenarios","time intervals","parameters","estimations","evolution"],"language":"en"},

Using in vitro translation assays and enzymatic and chemical probes for RNA structure, we have defined features of the pseudoknot that promote efficient frameshifting. Heterologous RNA structures, e.g. a hairpin, a tRNA or a synthetic pseudoknot, substituted downstream of the shifty site fail to promote frameshifting, suggesting that specific features of the MMTV pseudoknot are important for function. Site-directed mutations of the MMTV pseudoknot indicate that the pseudoknot junction, including an unpaired adenine nucleotide between the two stems, provides a specific structural determinant for efficient frameshifting.

To search for a polypeptide product derived from BM2ORF, a genetically engineered beta-galactosidase-BM2ORF fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised to the purified fusion protein. This antiserum was used to identify a polypeptide, designated BM2 protein (Mr approximately equal to 12,000), that is synthesized in influenza B virus-infected cells. To understand the mechanism by which the BM2 protein is generated from influenza B virus RNA segment 7, a mutational analysis of the cloned DNA was performed and the altered DNAs were expressed in eukaryotic cells. The expression patterns of the M1 and BM2 proteins from the altered DNAs indicate that the BM2 protein initiation codon overlaps with the termination codon of the M1 protein in an overlapping translational stop-start pentanucleotide, TAATG, and that the expression of the BM2 protein requires 5\u0027-adjacent termination of M1 synthesis.

It was recently reported that, in addition to the intrathymic T-cell differentiation pathway, an extrathymic differentiation pathway of alpha beta-T-cell receptor (TCR) T lymphocytes exists in the liver, and becomes important under pathological situations such as autoimmune diseases, malignancies or hepatic bacterial infections. In the present study, we compared the phenotypes of resident hepatic, splenic or thymic T-cell subpopulations during the acute viral hepatitis induced by HMV3 in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. The number of liver-resident mononuclear cells (MNC) increased during the viral infection, while cellularity decreased. Single positive (SP) CD4\u002B cells strongly increased in both the liver and thymus, while double positive (DP) (CD4\u002B CD8\u002B) cells, present in the liver and thymus of mock-infected mice, decreased in C57BL/6 mice during the viral infection. A shift of alpha beta-TCRintermediate T cells toward alpha beta-TCRhigh was evidenced in the liver and thymus of infected mice, but not in the spleen. The few alpha beta-TCRint double negative (DN) (CD4-CD8-) cells also decreased following viral infection. alpha beta-TCRint or high lymphocytes expressing high levels of leucocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) increased in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. In addition, liver-resident T cells expressed strongly the CD44 (Pgp-1) activation marker, suggesting that they were either activated or antigen experienced during the viral infection. No significant change in T-cell subpopulations was detected in the spleen, suggesting that MHV3 infection could induce an early in situ differentiation of resident hepatic T cells rather than a recruitment of lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid organs.","publish_time":"1997-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamontagne, L; Massicotte, E; Page, C","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1456597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liver-resident T cells","T lymphocytes","liver of MHV3","shift of alpha beta-TCRintermediate T cells","thymic T-cell subpopulations","situ differentiation of resident hepatic T cells","extrathymic differentiation pathway of alpha beta-T","intrathymic T-cell differentiation pathway","resident mononuclear cells","number of liver","following viral infection","MHV3 infection","alpha beta-TCRhigh","extrathymic T-cell subpopulation disorders","thymus of infected mice","acute viral hepatitis","cell receptor","alpha beta-TCRint double negative","phenotypes of resident hepatic","high lymphocytes","CD4-CD8","recruitment of lymphocytes","study of thymic","thymus of mock","addition","present study","spleen","hepatic bacterial infections","Mouse hepatitis virus type","susceptible C57BL","high levels of leucocyte function antigen","autoimmune diseases","malignancies","DN","HMV3","MNC","pathological situations","DP","CD44","peripheral lymphoid organs","excellent model","Pgp","significant change","LFA","coronavirus","activation marker","cellularity"],"language":"en"},

It is the product of rotavirus gene 9 which potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids that contains two amino terminal hydrophobic domains, h1 and h2, each preceded by an initiation codon. Comparison of the size of products derived from altered genes containing coding sequences for both h1 and h2 with those lacking the h1 sequence (\u0027dhl\u0027 mutants), indicates that initiation takes place at M30 immediately preceding h2 (residues F32 to L48) and that h2 is cleaved, confirming the studies of others (Stirzaker, S.C., P.L. Whitfeld, D.L. Christie, A.R. Bellamy, and G.W. Both. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:2897-2903). Our previous work had shown that deletions in the carboxy end of h2, extending to amino acid 61 in the open reading frame, resulted in secretion of VP7. The region from amino acid number 51-61, present in wild-type VP7 but missing in the secreted mutant delta 47-61, was thus implicated to have a role in ER retention. To test this, a series of chimeric genes were constructed by fusing the first 63 codons of wild-type VP7, delta 1-14 or delta 51-61/dhl, to the mouse salivary alpha-amylase gene, a secretory protein, such that the fusion junction was located at the exact mature terminus of amylase. The chimeric proteins VP7(63)/amylase, delta 1-14(63)/amylase and delta 51-61(63)/dhl/amylase were secreted when expressed in cells and the h2 domain was cleaved when mRNA was translated in vitro. These results imply that the sequence 51-61 is necessary but not sufficient for ER retention. When a second series of VP7/amylase chimera were constructed extending the VP7 contribution to amino acid 111, the product expressed by delta 1-14(111)/amylase was not secreted whereas that of delta 47- 61(111)/amylase was. Significantly, the intracellular delta 1- 14(111)/amylase product exhibited an amylase enzymatic specific activity that was similar to that of the wild-type amylase product. We conclude that two regions of VP7 mediate its retention in the ER, the first lies within the sequence 51-61 and the second within the sequence 62-111, which contains the glycosylation site for VP7. Both regions are necessary for retention, though neither is sufficient alone.","publish_time":"1988-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26b49bdf0c3d50386ae603783e9674b7349852df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["D.L.

Using a retroviral expression vector, two fusion proteins were expressed in rat pituitary (GH3) cells: a control protein consisting of the beta-lactamase signal peptide fused to chimpanzee alpha-globin (142 amino acids); and a chimera of the somatostatin signal peptide and proregion (82 amino acids) fused to alpha-globin. Control globin was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as determined by accurate cleavage of its signal peptide; however, alpha- globin was not secreted but was rapidly and quantitatively degraded intracellularly with a t 1/2 of 4-5 min. Globin degradation was insensitive to chloroquine, a drug which inhibits lysosomal proteases, but was inhibited at 16 degrees C suggesting proteolysis occurred during transport to the cis-Golgi apparatus. In contrast to the control globin, approximately 30% of the somatostatin propeptide-globin fusion protein was transported to the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus where it was endoproteolytically processed. Processing of the chimera occurred in an acidic intracellular compartment since cleavage was inhibited by 25 microM chloroquine. 60% of the transported chimera was cleaved at the Arg-Lys processing site in native prosomatostatin yielding \u0022mature\u0022 alpha-globin. Most significantly, approximately 50% of processed alpha-globin was sorted to the regulated pathway and secreted in response to 8-Br-cAMP. We conclude that the somatostatin propeptide mediated transport of alpha-globin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network by protecting molecules from degradation and in addition, facilitated packaging of alpha-globin into vesicles whose secretion was stimulated by cAMP.","publish_time":"1989-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeb155140e7a792d4af481ce9d14376046ba856d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alpha- globin","Control globin","processed alpha-globin","Globin degradation","chimpanzee alpha-globin","somatostatin propeptide-globin fusion protein","packaging of alpha","somatostatin propeptide mediated transport of alpha","somatostatin signal peptide","intracellular transport","control protein","transported chimera","beta-lactamase signal peptide","endoplasmic reticulum","amino acids","regulated pathway","cis-Golgi apparatus","trans-Golgi network","regulated secretory pathway","fusion proteins","accurate cleavage","microM chloroquine","Br-cAMP","acidic intracellular compartment","Arg-Lys processing site","native prosomatostatin","sorting","rat pituitary","GH3","cells","molecules","response","vesicles","proregion","distal elements","drug","retroviral expression vector","proteolysis","addition","secretion","degrees C","lysosomal proteases","role","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Antibody/antigen ratio in the complexes proved to be a critical parameter in enhancing antigen presentation. Complexes in moderate antibody excess provided optimal T cell activation independently of the physical state of the complexes (precipitated by a second antibody or solubilized by complement). Complexes in extreme antibody excess, on the contrary, did not yield T cell activation although taken up by APC efficiently. The effect of antibodies at extreme excess was observed with substimulatory dose of antigen (loss of potentiation) and with optimal dose of antigen (loss of stimulation). An excess of specific polyclonal antibodies hampers proteolytic degradation of antigen in vitro, supporting the view that a similar mechanism may operate within the APC that have internalized immune complexes in extreme antibody excess.

Further, incubation of the cells in 10 mM caffeine at 20 degrees C had profound effects on the distribution and the organization of the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack membranes. Caffeine treatment at 20 degrees C resulted in a selective and reversible translocation of the pre- and cis-Golgi marker protein (p58) to the periphery of the cell. This caffeine-induced effect on the Golgi complex was different from that induced by BFA, since mannosidase II, a Golgi stack marker, remained perinuclearly located and the Golgi stack coat protein, beta-COP, was not detached from Golgi membranes in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20 degrees C. Electron microscopic analysis showed that, in the presence of caffeine at 20 degrees C, the morphology of the Golgi stack was altered and accumulation of numerous small vesicles in the Golgi region was observed.

We have characterized the synthesis, posttranslational modification, and localization of the yeast alpha 1,3 mannosyltransferase (Mnn1p) using antibodies prepared against a segment of this protein expressed in bacteria. Mnn1p is initially synthesized as a 98.5-kD, type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is modified with both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. It is subject to a slow, incremental increase in molecular mass that is dependent upon protein transport to the Golgi complex. Self-modification of Mnn1p with alpha 1,3 mannose epitopes, primarily on O-linked oligosaccharides, is at least partly responsible for the incremental increase in molecular mass. Mnn1p is a resident protein of the Golgi complex and colocalizes with guanosine diphosphatase to at least two physically distinct Golgi compartments by sucrose gradient fractionation, one of which may be a late Golgi compartment that also contains the Kex2 endopeptidase. Surprisingly, we found that a significant fraction of Mnn1p is mislocalized to the plasma membrane in a clathrin heavy chain temperature sensitive mutant while guanosine diphosphatase remains intracellular. A mutant Mnn1p that lacks the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail is properly localized to the Golgi complex, indicating that clathrin does not mediate Mnnlp Golgi retention by a direct interaction with the Mnn1p cytoplasmic tail. These results indicate that clathrin plays a broader role in the localization of Golgi proteins than anticipated.","publish_time":"1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa09cbc24e8aa582a402d4542656f0a5b49963bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Golgi complex","mutant Mnn1p","Golgi compartment analogous","localization of Golgi proteins","late Golgi compartment","distinct Golgi compartments","Mnnlp Golgi retention","Mnn1p cytoplasmic tail","Self-modification of Mnn1p","significant fraction of Mnn1p","medial Golgi cisternae of higher eukaryotes","yeast alpha","linked mannose","O-linked oligosaccharides","guanosine diphosphatase","molecular mass","incremental increase","protein transport","Posttranslational modification of yeast glycoproteins","resident protein","clathrin heavy chain temperature sensitive mutant","plasma membrane","mannose epitopes","NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail","integral membrane glycoprotein","direct interaction","sucrose gradient fractionation","broader role","mannosyltransferase","colocalizes","kD","type","segment","antibodies","synthesis","Kex2 endopeptidase","bacteria","results"],"language":"en"},

No responses were seen in human neutrophils, monocytes, or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines. rHuMig was chemotactic for TIL by a modified Boyden chamber assay but rHuMig was not chemotactic for neutrophils or monocytes. The CHO cell lines, IFN-gamma-treated human peripheral-blood monocytes, and IFN-gamma-treated cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 all secreted multiple and identical HuMig species as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Using the CHO-derived rHuMig, we have shown that the species\u0027 heterogeneity is due to proteolytic cleavage at basic carboxy-terminal residues, and that the proteolysis occurs before and not after rHuMig secretion by the CHO cells.

Carboxy-terminal-truncated forms of rHuMig were of lower specific activity compared to full-length rHuMig in the calcium flux assay, and the truncated species did not block the activity of the full- length species. It is likely that HuMig plays a role in T cell trafficking and perhaps in other aspects of the physiology of activated T cells.","publish_time":"1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daf06fe518af2567566bd71fca278c8bc5fecddf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2192190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC","CHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHO-derived rHuMig","full-length rHuMig","CHO cells","rHuMig secretion","human neutrophils","major species of secreted rHuMig","truncated forms of rHuMig","recombinant human Mig","derived CHO cell lines","human peripheral-blood monocytes","treated cells","human peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes","human monocytic cell line THP","IFN-gamma","T cell trafficking","HuMig cDNA","truncated species","physiology of activated T cells","length species","human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes","identical HuMig species","B lymphoblastoid cell lines","mig gene","TIL","cDNA library","full-length secreted protein","lymphokine- activated macrophages","basic carboxy-terminal residues","calcium flux assay","lower specific activity","modified Boyden chamber assay","proteolytic cleavage","Epstein-Barr virus","role","aspects","differential screening","Chinese hamster ovary","CXC subfamily","Ca2","interferon","species\u0027 heterogeneity","chemokine","SDS-PAGE","transient elevation","proteolysis","amino acids","responses"],"language":"en"},

By indirect immunofluorescence, E2 and E1 were localized to the Golgi region of all three cell types, and their distribution was disrupted by treatment with BFA or nocodazole. Immunogold labeling demonstrated that E2 and E1 were localized to Golgi cisternae and indicated that the glycoproteins were distributed across the Golgi stack. Analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained from stably transfected CHO cells revealed that E2 and E1 become endo H resistant and undergo sialylation without being transported to the cell surface. Transport of RV glycoproteins to the Golgi complex was relatively slow (t1/2 = 60-90 min). Coprecipitation experiments indicated that E2 and E1 form a heterodimer in the RER. E1 was found to fold much more slowly than E2, suggesting that the delay in transport of the heterodimer to the Golgi may be due to the slow maturation of E1 in the ER. These results indicate that RV glycoproteins behave as integral membrane proteins of the Golgi complex and thus provide a useful model to study targeting and turnover of type I membrane proteins in this organelle.","publish_time":"1993-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/defb6d472091880138cc95da0589cb3bccbd51b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2200098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E1 glycoproteins","Golgi complex","RV envelope E2","Transport of RV glycoproteins","Golgi region","Golgi cisternae","Golgi stack","slow maturation of E1","different cell types","certain cell types","cell surface","transfected CHO cells","study","heterodimer","integral membrane proteins","intracellular site of targeting","intracellular membranes","Vero cells","BHK","turnover of type","endo H resistant","useful model","sialylation","distribution","treatment","BFA","Analysis of immunoprecipitates","organelle","cDNA","delay","t1","indirect immunofluorescence","Coprecipitation experiments","nocodazole","Rubella virus","RER","results","Immunogold"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrate that the PtK1 line of rat kangaroo kidney cells is resistant to BFA. The drug did not disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex in PtK1 cells, as judged by immunofluorescence using antibodies to 58- (58K) and 110-kD (beta-COP) Golgi proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy of live cells labeled with C6-NBD-ceramide. In addition, BFA did not inhibit protein secretion, not alter the kinetics or extent of glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G-protein) in VSV- infected PtK1 cells. To explore the mechanism of resistance to BFA, PtK1 cells were fused with BFA-sensitive CV-1 cells that had been infected with a recombinant SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G- protein and, at various times following fusion, the cultures were exposed to BFA. Shortly after cell fusion, heterokaryons contained one Golgi complex associated with each nucleus. Golgi membranes derived from CV-1 cells were sensitive to BFA, whereas those of PtK1 origin were BFA resistant. A few hours after fusion, most heterokaryons contained a single, large Golgi apparatus that was resistant to BFA and contained CV-1 galactosyltransferase. In unfused cells that had been perforated using nitrocellulose filters, retention of beta-COP on the Golgi was optimal in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and GTP. In perforated cell models of the BFA-sensitive MA104 line, BFA caused beta- COP to be released from the Golgi complex in the presence of nucleotides, and either MA104 or PtK1 cytosol. In contrast, when perforated PtK1 cells were incubated with BFA, nucleotides, and cytosol from either cell type, beta-COP remained bound to the Golgi complex. We conclude that PtK1 cells contain a nondiffusible factor, which is located on or very close to the Golgi complex, and confers a dominant resistance to BFA. It is possible that this factor is homologous to the target of BFA in cells that are sensitive to the drug.","publish_time":"1991-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f94c7a970b81de90b8594683b77db556e15ebd9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brefeldin"],"organizations":["VSV G","GTP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BFA resistant","Golgi complex","target of BFA","BFA-sensitive CV","Golgi proteins","VSV- infected PtK1 cells","Golgi stacks","Golgi membranes","unfused cells","Golgi cisternae","BFA-sensitive MA104 line","PtK1 cytosol","PtK1 origin","large Golgi apparatus","beta-COP","beta- COP","PtK1 line of rat kangaroo kidney cells","fluorescence microscopy of live cells","cell fusion","VSV G- protein","perforated cell models","G-protein","protein secretion","retention of beta","presence of cytosol","heterokaryons","presence of nucleotides","drug","earlier studies of numerous cell types","dominant resistance","mechanism of resistance","nondiffusible factor","vesicular stomatitis virus","glycoprotein","strain","gene","extent of glycosylation","C6-NBD","various times","kinetics","enzymes","nitrocellulose filters","cultures","morphology","ATP","immunofluorescence","kD","recombinant SV","ceramide","GTP","hours","galactosyltransferase","addition","nucleus","contrast","antibodies","Brefeldin"],"language":"en"},

In this study we have defined a novel post-RER, pre-Golgi compartment where unassembled subunits of rubella virus (RV) E1 glycoprotein accumulate. When RV E1 is expressed in CHO cells in the absence of E2 glycoprotein, transport of E1 to the Golgi complex is arrested. The compartment in which E1 accumulates consists of a tubular network of smooth membranes which is in continuity with the RER but has distinctive properties from either the RER, Golgi, or previously characterized intermediate compartments. It lacks RER and Golgi membrane proteins and is not disrupted by agents which disrupt either the RER (thapsigargin, ionomycin) or Golgi (nocodazole and brefeldin A). However, luminal ER proteins bearing the KDEL signal have access to this compartment. Kinetically the site of E1 arrest lies distal to or at the site where palmitylation occurs and proximal to the low temperature 15 degrees C block. Taken together the findings suggest that the site of E1 arrest corresponds to, or is located close to the exit site from the ER. This compartment could be identified morphologically because it is highly amplified in cells overexpressing unassembled E1 subunits, but it may have its counterpart among the transitional elements of non-transfected cells.

Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with impaired quality of life and pulmonary function.

Previous studies have analyzed the global gene expression profiles of lung tissue in vivo and PAMs in vitro following infection with PRRSV, however, transcriptome-wide understanding of the interaction between highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) and PAMs in vivo has not yet been established. In this study, we employed Affymetrix microarrays to investigate the gene expression patterns of PAMs isolated from Tongcheng piglets (a Chinese indigenous breed) after infection with HP-PRRSV. During the infection, Tongcheng piglets exhibited typical clinical signs, e.g. fever, asthma, coughing, anorexia, lethargy and convulsion, but displayed mild regional lung damage at 5 and 7 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed that HP-PRRSV infection has affected PAMs in expression of the important genes involved in cytoskeleton and exocytosis organization, protein degradation and folding, intracellular calcium and zinc homeostasis.

METHODS: Three microliters of dispase at a concentration of 0.2 U/\u03BCl were injected into the vitreal cavities of 4\u20136-week-old mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence analysis, and electroretinograms of the eyes were then performed to assess ocular changes, and enzyme-linked immunospot assays and intracellular staining of single-cell suspensions of the spleens were used to detect immune changes during an 8 week observation period. RESULTS: Neutrophils were the main inflammatory infiltrating cells appearing at the anterior chamber. No cluster of differentiation (CD)3\u002B labeled T cells, F4/80\u002B labeled macrophages, or CD56\u002B labeled natural killer cells were found in the vitreal cavities or retinas in dispase-injected mice within 5 days after injection. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)-like signs first appeared at 2 weeks, gradually increased thereafter, and reached peak values at 8 weeks. There was a statistically significant difference in b-wave amplitudes between the PVR and saline-control eyes. Enzyme-linked immunospot assays and intracellular staining showed that specific CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B labeled T cells were not involved in dispase-injected mice.

The main aim of our study was to determine types, frequencies, etiologies, and epidemiologic factors of respiratory diseases among Iranian Hajj pilgrims and to suggest some preventive and treatment strategies. Methods: To determine the types and frequencies of respiratory syndromes, we implemented a syndromic surveillance method in Iranian health care system for Hajj during 5 consecutive years. To achieve the etiology of these diseases, we performed 4 concurrent before and after studies. We also evaluated efficacy of the flu and pneumovax vaccines among Iranian Hajj pilgrims in 2 studies. To determine some other epidemiological factors, we conducted 4 additional studies. Results: The most common problem was common cold like syndrome. Origins of the most upper respiratory problems were infections, and allergies were less involved. Among infectious agents, viruses were the most common agents and their frequencies were as follows respectively: Adenoviruses 38 (36.2 %), Rhinoviruses 31 (30%), Influenza type B virus 21 (20%). Bacteria were often the secondary causes and their frequencies were as follows respectively: Intestine bacillus 69 (19.4%), Chlamydia pneumonia 20(15.8%), Haemophiluses 32 (9.1%) and Streptococcus (A,C and G) 30 ( 8.5%). We introduced some epidemiological factors as effective in creating respiratory diseases.

In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus\u2010Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). MERS\u2010CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS\u2010CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus\u2010host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS\u2010CoV. We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS\u2010CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03BAB signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit double\u2010stranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages. MERS\u2010CoV strongly inhibits the activation of T cells with downregulation of antigen presentation. In addition, uncontrolled secretion of interferon \u0263\u2010induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20101 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells.","publish_time":"2018-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shokri, Somayeh; Mahmoudvand, Shahab; Taherkhani, Reza; Farshadpour, Fatemeh","journal":"J Cell Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bfd9a40e27ada726f348a238e9509989780aedf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146782/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.27155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":["Middle East","Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["CoV","human coronavirus","human transmission","Plppro of MERS","human infections","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","new human disease","exact origin of MERS","major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS","acute respiratory tract infection","proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells","induced protein","disease severity","enteric disease","nonstructural protein","transmission pattern","zoonotic transmission","addition","major reservoir host","monocyte chemoattractant protein","innate immune evasion","virological studies","host interactions","Recent studies","infection outcome","mentioned proteins","b proteins","early induction of IFN","activation of T cells","uncontrolled secretion of interferon \u0263","cough","dromedary camels","high fever","NSP15","pathways","double","\u03BAB","nuclear factor","evidence","multiorgan dysfunction","downregulation of antigen presentation","stranded RNA sensors","rapid apoptosis of macrophages","NSP4a","humans","healthcare facilities","Erasmus Medical Center","type","NSP4b","animals","need","death","infected individuals","communities","review"],"language":"en"},

With approximately 3% of the human population infected worldwide, HCV infection remains a global public health challenge. The efficacy of current therapy is still limited in many patients infected with HCV, thus a greater understanding of pathogenesis in HCV infection is desperately needed. Emerging lines of evidence indicate that HCV triggers a wide range of cellular stress responses, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR), and autophagy. Also, recent studies suggest that these HCV-induced cellular responses may contribute to chronic liver diseases by modulating cell proliferation, altering lipid metabolism, and potentiating oncogenic pathways. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HCV infection in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases still remains to be determined. Here, we review the known stress response activation in HCV infection in vitro and in vivo, and also explore the possible relationship of a variety of cellular responses with the pathogenicity of HCV-associated diseases. Comprehensive knowledge of HCV-mediated disease progression shall shed new insights into the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the development of new intervention strategy.","publish_time":"2012-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ke, Po-Yuan; Chen, Steve S.-L.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33bee45e93ec92d0813e39a07e158605af679215.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3497051.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v4102251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","pathogenicity of HCV","Comprehensive knowledge of HCV","pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases","chronic liver disease progression","variety of cellular responses","wide range of cellular stress responses","associated diseases","known stress response activation","mediated disease progression","new insights","cell cycle arrest","modulating cell proliferation","unfolded protein response","greater understanding of pathogenesis","development of new intervention strategy","endoplasmic reticulum","steatosis","leading risk factor","lipid metabolism","apoptosis","discovery of novel therapeutic targets","cirrhosis","UPR","global public health challenge","hepatitis C virus","possible relationship","molecular mechanism","Emerging lines of evidence","oncogenic pathways","hepatocellular carcinoma","human population","efficacy of current therapy","autophagy","recent studies","patients"],"language":"en"},

However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions have not yet been established. We investigate a potentially useful relatively non-invasive biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), to predict favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast, common treatment for children with asthma. METHODS: Young children (1 to 6 years old) were enrolled in this randomized, parallel, 2-group, open-label trial. Criteria for eligibility included: 1) being symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) having a serum EDN (sEDN) level \u2265 53 ng/mL, with positive specific immunoglobulin E to house dust mite. Eligible patients were randomly placed into 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily; the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily. Ineligible patients were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily (OBS group). Treatment period was 12 weeks. RESULTS: Asthma control days increased significantly in the BIS and MONT groups (P \u003C 0.000) over the 12-week study period. There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group but there was a significant decrease in the MONT group (P \u003C 0.000). Patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels (\u003C 53 ng/mL) showed a significant decrease due to MONT treatment (P = 0.023). Rescue medication usage significantly decreased in the BIS and MONT groups (P \u003C 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: EDN is a useful relatively non-invasive biomarker for predicting responses to montelukast and budesonide treatment of preschool children with beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze (Trial registry at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000008335).","publish_time":"2018-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Chang-Keun; Callaway, Zak; Park, Jin-Sung; Nishimori, Hisashi; Ogino, Tikatoshi; Nagao, Mizuho; Fujisawa, Takao","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2060cb027399ce2ff97b6f9d17b932aa16dd0844.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6182197.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2018.10.6.686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306750/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BIS","MONT","OBS","EDN","UMIN Clinical Trials Registry"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BIS group","MONT treatment","OBS group","asthma treatment","Treatment period","MONT groups","common treatment","treatment decisions","budesonide treatment of preschool children","serum EDN","significant decrease","Trial registry","high EDN levels","non-invasive biomarker","Young children","sEDN","significant change","run-in period","Ineligible patients","budesonide inhalation suspension","Asthma control days","week study period","favorable responses","definitive criteria","multiple-trigger wheeze","open-label trial","UMIN Clinical Trials Registry","beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze","positive specific immunoglobulin E","house dust mite","eosinophil-derived neurotoxin","UMIN000008335","eosinophilic inflammation","PURPOSE","markers","years old","RESULTS","Rescue medication usage","eligibility","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","weeks"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: IBV strain GD was isolated from southern China in 2013 and the complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed. RESULTS: The genome of approximately 27,680 nt comprised six genes, with insertions and mutations in most of the structural genes. The S1 gene showed the highest identity to strain TW2575/98 isolated in Taiwan, and was distantly related to the H120 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the S1 gene of strain GD was also related to that of TW-type strains. Recombination analysis indicated that strain GD was a chimera whose putative parental strains belonged to the QX- and TW-type subgroups.

Ebola virus (EBOV) is a lethal pathogen that causes up to 90% mortality in humans, whereas H5N1 avian influenza has a 60% fatality rate. Both viruses are considered pandemic threats. The objective was to evaluate the protective efficacy of a bivalent, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine expressing both the A/Hanoi/30408/2005 H5N1 hemagglutinin and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP) in a lethal mouse model of infection. Methods. Mice were vaccinated 28 days before or 30 minutes after a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV or selected H5N1 influenza viruses from clades 0, 1, and 2. Animals were monitored for weight loss and survival, in addition to humoral and cell-mediated responses after immunization. Results. A single VSV\u0394G-HA-ZGP injection was efficacious when administered 28 days before a homologous H5N1 and/or mouse-adapted EBOV challenge, as well as a heterologous H5N1 challenge. Postexposure protection was only observed in vaccinated animals challenged with homologous H5N1 and/or mouse-adapted EBOV. Analysis of the adaptive immune response postvaccination revealed robust specific T- and B-cell responses, including a potent hemagglutinin inhibition antibody response against all H5N1 strains tested.

Over-expression of the miR-26 family strongly inhibited PRRSV replication in vitro, as shown by virus titer assays, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR assays. MiR-26a inhibited the replication of both type 1 and type 2 PRRSV strains. Mutating the seed region of miR-26 restored viral titers.

Thus far, MERS outbreaks have been reported from Saudi Arabia (2013 and 2014) and South Korea (2015). No specific vaccine has yet been reported against MERS. PURPOSE: To address the urgent need for an MERS vaccine, in the present study, we have designed two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) against MERS utilizing several in silico methods and tools. METHODS: The design of both the multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) are composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, screened form thirteen different proteins of MERS-CoV. Both the MEVs also carry potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon-\u03B3-inducing epitopes. Human \u03B2-defensin-2 and \u03B2-defensin-3 were used as adjuvants to enhance the immune response of MEVs. To design the MEVs, short peptide molecular linkers were utilized to link screened most potential CTL epitopes, HTL epitopes and the adjuvants. Tertiary models for both the MEVs were generated, refined, and further studied for their molecular interaction with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNAs of both MEVs were generated and analyzed in silico for their expression in a mammalian host cell line (human). RESULTS: Screened CTL and HTL epitopes were found to have high propensity for stable molecular interaction with HLA alleles molecules. CTL epitopes were also found to have favorable molecular interaction within the cavity of transporter associated with antigen processing. The selected CTL and HTL epitopes jointly cover upto 94.0% of worldwide human population. Both the CTL and HTL MEVs molecular models have shown to have stable binding and complex formation propensity with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNA analysis of both the MEVs have shown high expression tendency in mammalian host cell line (human). CONCLUSION: After multistage in silico analysis, both the MEVs are predicted to elicit humoral as well as cell mediated immune response. Epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover large human population worldwide. Hence both the designed MEVs could be tried in vivo as potential vaccine candidates against MERS.","publish_time":"2018-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Srivastava, Sukrit; Kamthania, Mohit; Singh, Soni; Saxena, Ajay K; Sharma, Nishi","journal":"Infect Drug Resist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed94f0bd0fe17c099f8cdff4bf9edbbd29ebf41f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6254671.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s175114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epitopes"],"organizations":["MERS","CTL","HTL","HLA"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["designed MEVs","HTL epitopes","potential CTL epitopes","HTL MEVs molecular models","MERS vaccine","MERS-CoV","immune response of MEVs","MERS coronavirus","MERS outbreaks","Screened CTL","B-cell discontinuous epitopes","different proteins of MERS","selected CTL","stable molecular interaction","favorable molecular interaction","Human \u03B2-defensin","mammalian host cell line","large human population","potential B-cell linear epitope regions","silico analysis","silico methods","multi-epitope vaccines","potential vaccine candidates","high propensity","screened form","short peptide molecular linkers","toll","receptor","adjuvants","specific vaccine","high expression tendency","helper T lymphocyte","cytotoxic T lymphocyte","stable binding","Tertiary models","cDNA analysis","complex formation propensity","cavity of transporter","HLA alleles molecules","Middle East respiratory syndrome","upto","BACKGROUND","urgent need","interferon-\u03B3","RESULTS","present study","antigen processing","CONCLUSION","Saudi Arabia","PURPOSE","tools","South Korea","cDNAs"],"language":"en"},

Every year the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosts the Hajj pilgrimage, the largest gathering held on an annual basis where over 2 million people come to KSA from over 180 countries. Living together in crowded conditions exposes the pilgrims and the local population to a range infectious diseases. Respiratory and gastrointestinal tract bacterial and viral infections can spread rapidly and affect attendees of mass gatherings. Lethal infectious disease outbreaks were common during Hajj in the 19th and 20th centuries although they have now been controlled to a great extent by the huge investments made by the KSA into public health prevention and surveillance programs. The KSA provides regular updated Hajj travel advice and health regulations through international public health agencies such as the WHO, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Hajj travel agencies. During the Hajj, an additional 25 000 health workers are deployed; there are eight hospitals in Makkah and Mina complete with state-of-the-art surgical wards and intensive care units made specifically available for pilgrims. All medical facilities offer high quality of care, and services are offered free to Hajj pilgrims to ensure the risks of ill health to all pilgrims and KSA residents are minimal.

Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre.

CONCLUSIONS: Besides satisfying the Koch\u2019s postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Yuan, Shuofeng; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Chan, Wan-Mui; Fan, Zhimeng; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Wen, Lei; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Chen, Yanxia; Tang, Kaiming; Luo, Cuiting; Cai, Jian-Piao; Kok, Kin-Hang; Chu, Hin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chen, Zhiwei; Chen, Honglin; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ac544ebb283cb03324dc7c36535b77a202bb921.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung virus titre","infected hamsters","lung pathology","SARS-CoV","high lung viral load","infected na\u00EFve contact hamsters","week of virus challenge","index hamsters","mean serum neutralising antibody titre","virus nucleocapsid protein expression","surface spike protein of SARS","available hamster model","weight loss","transmission","golden Syrian hamster","days post-challenge","cytokine assay","passive immunoprophylaxis","similar pathology","receptor-binding domain","early convalescent serum","marked cytokine activation","physiological small animal model","later proliferative phase of tissue repair","initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage","airway","intestinal involvement","extensive apoptosis","histopathological changes","significant decrease","spleen","lymphoid atrophy","COVID","Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing","important tool","chemokine","common laboratory mammals","ACE2","angiotensin","pathogenesis","blood","consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation","histopathology","Koch\u2019s postulates","Molecular docking","BACKGROUND","enzyme","treatment","vaccination","cage","Serial organ tissues","METHODS","option","viruses","low mortality","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","TCID"],"language":"en"},

Although antigenic mimicry has been proposed as a major mechanism by which viruses could trigger the development of such diseases, it is not easy to understand how widely different viruses might induce these blood autoimmune diseases by this sole mechanism. In mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), or mouse hepatitis virus, and treated with anti-erythrocyte or anti-platelet monoclonal autoantibodies at a dose insufficient to induce clinical disease by themselves, the infection sharply enhances the pathogenicity of autoantibodies, leading to severe anemia or thrombocytopenia. This effect is observed only with antibodies that induce disease through phagocytosis. Moreover, the phagocytic activity of macrophages from infected mice is increased and the enhancing effect of infection on autoantibody-mediated pathogenicity is strongly suppressed by treatment of mice with clodronate-containing liposomes. Finally, the disease induced by LDV after administration of autoantibodies is largely suppressed in animals deficient for gamma-interferon receptor. Together, these observations suggest that viruses may trigger autoantibody-mediated anemia or thrombocytopenia by activating macrophages through gamma-interferon production, a mechanism that may account for the pathogenic similarities of multiple infectious agents.","publish_time":"2004-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Musaji, Andrei; Meite, Mory; Detalle, Laurent; Franquin, St\u00E9phanie; Cormont, Fran\u00E7oise; Pr\u00E9at, V\u00E9ronique; Izui, Shozo; Coutelier, Jean-Paul","journal":"Autoimmun Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aff6fda73b58ee764a3a9ca715e042a102342db1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185387.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997204002307; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568997204002307","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thrombocytopenia","pathogenicity of autoantibodies","infected mice","autoantibody-mediated anemia","LDV","pathogenesis of blood autoimmune diseases","administration of autoantibodies","autoantibody-mediated pathogenicity","hemolytic anemia","severe anemia","treatment of mice","different viruses","sole mechanism","major mechanism","clinical disease","anti-platelet monoclonal autoantibodies","gamma-interferon receptor","gamma-interferon production","enhancing effect of infection","anti-erythrocyte","mouse hepatitis virus","phagocytic activity of macrophages","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","dose insufficient","animals deficient","pathogenic similarities of multiple infectious agents","clodronate","Viral infections","phagocytosis","liposomes","observations","development","antigenic mimicry"],"language":"en"},

Overexpression of miR-146a significantly blocked DENV2-induced autophagy, and LNA-mediated inhibition of miR-146a counteracted these effects. Moreover, co-overexpression of TRAF6, a target of miR-146a, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-146a on autophagy. Notably, treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03B2 fully restored the autophagic activity in TRAF6-silenced cells. Furthermore, our data showed that, in DENV2-infected A549 cells, autophagy promoted a pro-inflammatory response to significantly increase TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 production.

While many infections have been fatal, there have also been a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases discovered through monitoring and contact tracing. New Zealand white rabbits are a possible model for asymptomatic infection with MERS-CoV. In order to discover more about non-lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with MERS-CoV would protect against reinfection, we inoculated rabbits with MERS-CoV and monitored the antibody and inflammatory response. Following intranasal infection, rabbits developed a transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high levels of viral RNA, viral antigen, and perivascular inflammation in multiple lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs. The rabbits developed antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutralizing activity and the animals were not protected from reinfection. In fact, reinfection resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation, without an associated increase in viral RNA titers. Interestingly, passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to na\u00EFve rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection. We further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of complement proteins compared to primary infection. However, reinfection elicited neutralizing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge. Our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to MERS-CoV who fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response, or persons whose neutralizing antibody titers have waned, may be at risk for severe lung disease on re-exposure to MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2017-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Houser, Katherine V.; Broadbent, Andrew J.; Gretebeck, Lisa; Vogel, Leatrice; Lamirande, Elaine W.; Sutton, Troy; Bock, Kevin W.; Minai, Mahnaz; Orandle, Marlene; Moore, Ian N.; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/555a36d1c3822baa8b6a2612b86ed5df5b1dbf7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5574614.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28817732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","infected rabbits","na\u00EFve rabbits","asymptomatic infection","reinfection","viral proteins","primary infection","single infection","intranasal infection","viral antigen","viral RNA titers","neutralizing antibodies","enhanced inflammation","neutralizing antibody titers","neutralizing antibody response","enhanced pulmonary inflammation","perivascular inflammation","New Zealand white rabbits","neutralizing activity","subsequent viral challenge","high levels of viral RNA","transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection","asymptomatic cases","severe lung disease","associated increase","cause of severe acute respiratory disease","possible model","rabbit model","confirmed cases","inflammatory response","multiple lung lobes","non-lethal infections","increased recruitment of complement proteins","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","re-exposure","persons","monitoring","large number of mild","passive transfer of serum","risk","people","contact tracing","reported deaths","zoonotic betacoronavirus","animals","fact","order","humans","data","clinical signs"],"language":"en"},

On another front, point-of-care infection diagnostic methods at the bedside are significantly lacking. Here, we used a newly developed protocol of integrating an exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection device (PKU BioScreen) and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to investigate what bacterial pathogens can be directly exhaled out from humans. Exhaled breath condensates were collected from human subjects with respiratory infection symptoms at Peking University 3rd hospital using the BioScreen. The screened bacterial pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Stphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma Pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results were further compared and validated using throat swabs from the same patients by a PCR method. Here, human bacterial pathogens such as H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA were detected in exhaled breath using the developed protocol that integrates the EBC collection and LAMP. For the patients recruited from the hospital, seven types of pathogens were detected from 36.5% of them, and for the remaining subjects none of those screened bacterial pathogens was detected. Importantly, some super resistant bacteria such as MRSA were detected from the exhaled breath, suggesting that breathing might be also an important bacterial transmission route. Results from throat swabs showed that 36.2% of the subjects were found to be infected with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia, S. aureus and MRSA. For the EBC samples, 33.3% were found to be infected with MRSA, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Depending on the initial pathogen load in the sample, the entire protocol (EBC-LAMP) only takes 20\u201360min to complete for a respiratory infection diagnosis. For different detection methods and pathogens, the agreements between the EBC and throat swabs from the same patients were found to range from 35% to 65%. Here, we have detected several bacterial pathogens including MRSA from exhaled breath, and the developed protocol could be very useful for the bedside pathogen screening particularly in remote areas where resources are significantly limited or prohibited.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Yunhao; Chen, Haoxuan; Yao, Maosheng; Li, Xiaoguang","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35acfbce6a0ccde0195293222f6bbf2dc9877dd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094568.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850217300514; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850217300514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","S. aureus"],"organizations":["Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification","Peking University","MRSA","LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRSA","human bacterial pathogens","screened bacterial pathogens","Exhaled breath condensates","EBC-LAMP","types of pathogens","respiratory bacterial infections","EBC collection","developed protocol","EBC samples","throat swabs","patients","important bacterial transmission route","Staphylococcus aureus","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Escherichia coli","entire protocol","human subjects","respiratory infection symptoms","respiratory infection diagnosis","Haemophilus influenzae","Methicillin-resistant Stphylococcus aureus","hospital","remaining subjects","results","care infection diagnostic methods","bedside pathogen screening","Klebsiella pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Chlamydia pneumonia","Mycoplasma Pneumonia","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","collection device","PKU BioScreen","transmission of viruses","initial pathogen load","different detection methods","super resistant bacteria","Legionella pneumophila","Acinetobacter baumannii","Peking University","Loop","agreements","remote areas","relevant evidence","Isothermal Amplification","breathing","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","resources","point","PCR method","influenza outbreak","humans"],"language":"en"},

It shows how Vietnam\u2019s framing of avian flu has shifted, under the pressure from international organisations and the US administration, from an epizootic and zoonotic risk (or a classic risk) to a pandemic threat (or a late modern risk).

Afterwards, a hierarchical procedure is applied to clustering DNA sequences based on the feature vectors. RESULTS: The proposed distance measure and clustering method are evaluated by clustering functionally related genes and by phylogenetic analysis. This method is also compared with BlastClust, CD-HIT-EST and some others.

Methods All unformed stool was tested for the presence of Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), and cultured for C. difficile. Culture filtrates were also tested for TcdA and TcdB. Detection of tcdA and tcdB genes was carried out for A2B\u002B strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, vancomycin and clindamycin for all isolates were tested using the Etest. PCR ribotyping was carried out on all isolates. Results The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100000 patient days. Most cases occurred in renal and haematology patients. CDAD was more common in patients aged over 50 years and of male gender. The Indian population was under-represented. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were A-B\u002B. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole but one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Only 12.8% of the isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A, of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC \u003E256mg/L.

Animal models are indispensable for evaluating novel intervention strategies in this complex patient population. To complement existing models in rodents and non-human primates, we have evaluated the potential benefits of an HRSV infection model in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). Nine- to 12-month-old HRSV-seronegative immunocompetent or immunocompromised ferrets were infected with a low-passage wild-type strain of HRSV subgroup A (10(5) TCID(50)) administered by intra-tracheal or intra-nasal inoculation. Immune suppression was achieved by bi-daily oral administration of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Throat and nose swabs were collected daily and animals were euthanized four, seven, or 21 days post-infection (DPI). Virus loads were determined by quantitative virus culture and qPCR. We observed efficient HRSV replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In immunocompromised ferrets, virus loads reached higher levels and showed delayed clearance as compared to those in immunocompetent animals. Histopathological evaluation of animals euthanized 4 DPI demonstrated that the virus replicated in the respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. These animal models can contribute to an assessment of the efficacy and safety of novel HRSV intervention strategies.","publish_time":"2016-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stittelaar, Koert J.; de Waal, Leon; van Amerongen, Geert; Veldhuis Kroeze, Edwin J.B.; Fraaij, Pieter L.A.; van Baalen, Carel A.; van Kampen, Jeroen J.A.; van der Vries, Erhard; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.; de Swart, Rik L.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1a923d7df508695294b544c5e2c975e9fd35e14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4926188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27314379/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v8060168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Throat"],"organizations":["HRSV","DPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus loads","HRSV infection model","immunocompromised ferrets","Human respiratory syncytial virus","efficient HRSV replication","safety of novel HRSV intervention strategies","month-old HRSV-seronegative immunocompetent","Animal models","immunocompetent animals","lower respiratory tract","quantitative virus culture","novel intervention strategies","immunocompromised patients","respiratory epithelial cells","existing models","low-passage wild-type strain of HRSV subgroup","important cause of severe respiratory tract disease","Histopathological evaluation of animals","non-human primates","intra-nasal inoculation","days post-infection","bi-daily oral administration of tacrolimus","higher levels","mycophenolate mofetil","trachea","rodents","Mustela putorius furo","efficacy","complex patient population","potential benefits","delayed clearance","assessment","prednisolone","nose swabs","qPCR","Immune suppression","Throat","bronchioles","TCID"],"language":"en"},

This study sought to determine whether human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with upper respiratory tract infections among older children and adults in Ghana. METHODS: We conducted a case control study among older children and adults in three rural areas of Ghana using asymptomatic subjects as controls. Nasal/Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-22E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS: Out of 1,213 subjects recruited, 150 (12.4%) were positive for one or more viruses. Of these, single virus detections occurred in 146 subjects (12.0%) and multiple detections occurred in 4 (0.3%). Compared with control subjects, infections with HCoV-229E (OR = 5.15, 95%CI = 2.24\u201311.78), HCoV-OC43 (OR = 6.16, 95%CI = 1.77\u201321.65) and combine HCoVs (OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.5 = 3.72) were associated with upper respiratory tract infections. HCoVs were found to be seasonally dependent with significant detections in the harmattan season (mainly HCoV-229E) and wet season (mainly HCoV-NL63). A comparison of the obtained sequences resulted in no differences to sequences already published in GenBank. CONCLUSION: HCoVs could play significant role in causing upper respiratory tract infections among adults and older children in rural areas of Ghana.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Owusu, Michael; Annan, Augustina; Corman, Victor Max; Larbi, Richard; Anti, Priscilla; Drexler, Jan Felix; Agbenyega, Olivia; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Drosten, Christian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a445e4cc0146046d191344e3b61cd8dd4f33eb83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4117488.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080241/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099782","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Ghana","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NL63","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-HKU1","upper respiratory tract infections","HCoVs","Acute respiratory tract infections","older children","adults","control subjects","CI","significant detections","asymptomatic subjects","rural areas of Ghana","multiple detections","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","case control study","single virus detections","significant role","harmattan season","wet season","obtained sequences","Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","MERS-CoV","mortality","leading cause of morbidity","developing countries","Nasopharyngeal swabs","BACKGROUND","differences","human coronaviruses","CONCLUSION","controls","Africa","Nasal","comparison","METHODS","GenBank","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, although SARS infected some 10,000 individuals, killing around 1000, it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared, but a rather disproportionate economic impact. The disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause catastrophic impacts on the global economy. Understanding factors that led to the impact of SARS might help to deal with the possible impact and management of such other infectious disease outbreaks. In this respect, the role of risk\u2014its perception, communication and management\u2014is critical. This paper looks at the role that risk, and especially the perception of risk, its communication and management, played in driving the economic impact of SARS. It considers the public and public health response to SARS, the role of the media and official organisations, and proposes policy and research priorities for establishing a system to better deal with the next global infectious disease outbreak. It is concluded that the potential for the rapid spread of infectious disease is not necessarily a greater threat than it has always been, but the effect that an outbreak can have on the economy is, which requires further research and policy development.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Richard D.","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130909.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953606004060; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953606004060","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["economic impact of SARS","infectious disease outbreaks","possible impact","disproportionate economic impact","global infectious disease outbreak","serious disease","rapid spread of infectious disease","management","role of risk","devastating health impact","perception of risk","communication","global economy","public health response","research priorities","better deal","policy development","disproportionate scale","likelihood","catastrophic impacts","official organisations","increased globalisation","severe acute respiratory syndrome","system","nature","media","concern","Abstract","potential","recent example","greater threat","respect","paper","country","effect","individuals","factors"],"language":"en"}]}

As of 28th May 2014, 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to World Health Organization including 14 cases imported by travelers. The epicenter of the current MERS-CoV epidemic is located in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims travel for two mass gatherings annually. In this review we summarize MERS-CoV cases in relation to travel with focus on the epidemiology and prevention in travelers. It is important to increase awareness of travelers about the risks and appropriate preventive measures and for health professionals to be on alert if a patient with severe respiratory symptoms reports a recent history of travel to the region affected with MERS-CoV. Measures should be taken by local health authorities of the affected countries in order to improve hospital hygiene.

The current piece reviews a thematic series on surveillance-response systems for elimination of tropical diseases. Overall, 22 contributions covering a broad array of diseases are featured \u2013 i.e. clonorchiasis, dengue, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), H7N9 avian influenza, lymphatic filariasis, malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), rabies, schistosomiasis and tuberculosis (TB). There are five scoping reviews, a commentary, a letter to the editor, an opinion piece and an editorial pertaining to the theme \u201CElimination of tropical disease through surveillance and response\u201D. The remaining 13 articles are original contributions mainly covering (i) drug resistance; (ii) innovation and validation in the field of mathematical modelling; (iii) elimination of infectious diseases; and (iv) social media reports on disease outbreak notifications released by national health authorities. Analysis of the authors\u2019 affiliations reveals that scientists from the People\u2019s Republic of China (P.R. China) are prominently represented. Possible explanations include the fact that the 2012 and 2014 international conferences pertaining to surveillance-response mechanisms were both hosted by the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD) in Shanghai, coupled with P.R. China\u2019s growing importance with regard to the control of infectious diseases. Within 4 to 22 months of publication, three of the 22 contributions were viewed more than 10 000 times each. With sustained efforts focusing on relevant and strategic information towards control and elimination of infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases of Poverty has become a leading journal in the field of surveillance and response systems in infectious diseases and beyond.

In this study, we characterized the interaction between erythrocytes and unrelated Ad serotypes, human 5 (HAd5) and 37 (HAd37), and canine 2 (CAV-2). While these serotypes agglutinate human erythrocytes, they use different receptors, have different tropisms and/or infect different species. Using molecular, biochemical, structural and transgenic animal-based analyses, we found that the primary erythrocyte interaction domain for HAd37 is its sialic acid binding site, while CAV-2 binding depends on at least three factors: electrostatic interactions, sialic acid binding and, unexpectedly, binding to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on human erythrocytes. We show that the presence of CAR on erythrocytes leads to prolonged in vivo blood half-life and significantly reduced liver infection when a CAR-tropic Ad is injected intravenously.

Their cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanistic signaling axes have been extensively documented, but only a few anti-viral activities of cardenolides and the associated signaling pathways have been reported. Previously, we reported that a variety of cardenolides impart anti-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) activity in swine testicular (ST) cells, through targeting of the cell membrane sodium/potassium pump, Na\u002B/K\u002B-ATPase. Herein, we further explore the potential signaling cascades associated with this anti-TGEV activity in ST cells. Ouabain, a representative cardenolide, was found to potently diminish TGEV titers and inhibit the TGEV-induced production of IL-6 in a dose dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 37 nM and 23 nM respectively. By pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing, we demonstrated that PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling was induced in TGEV-infected ST cells, and ouabain imparted a degree of anti-TGEV activity via further augmentation of this existing PI3K_PDK1 axis signaling, in a manner dependent upon its association with the Na\u002B/K\u002B-ATPase. Finally, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or PDK1 by BX795 antagonized the anti-viral activity of ouabain and restored the TGEV virus titer and yields. This finding is the first report of a PI3K_PDK1 signaling axis further induced by ouabain and implicated in the suppression of TGEV activity and replication; greatly illuminates the underlying mechanism of cardenolide toxicity; and is expected to result in one or more anti-viral applications for the cardenolides in the future.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Cheng-Wei; Chang, Hsin-Yu; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Lee, Shiow-Ju","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f07e45fbcbd8d663676f787b0f06c9df8cdce03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103114.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2018.07.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X18303429; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X18303429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["degree of anti-TGEV activity","suppression of TGEV activity","anti-viral activity of ouabain","TGEV titers","TGEV-infected ST cells","anti-viral activities of cardenolides","TGEV virus titer","anti-viral applications","TGEV-induced production of IL","PDK1 axis","inhibition of PI3K","Abstract Cardenolides","variety of cardenolides","existing PI3K","anti-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","manner dependent","nM","ATPase","dose dependent manner","underlying mechanism of cardenolide toxicity","pharmacological inhibition","representative cardenolide","cell membrane sodium","BX795","augmentation","swine testicular","potassium pump","targeting","replication","plant-derived toxic substances","gene silencing","inhibitory concentrations","LY294002","cascades","cytotoxicity","axes","yields","association","report","RSK2","future","potential","pathways","finding"],"language":"en"},

Objectives We determined the burden of disease due to HCoV-NL63 infections using the population-based PRI.DE cohort of children under the age of 3 with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design In total 1756 respiratory samples, from hospitalized children or children who visited the outpatient clinic, were tested for HCoV-NL63. Sampling covered a period of 2 years and the frequency of infection in different years was compared to other Western European studies that tested for this virus in 2 or more consecutive years. Results Sixty-nine samples were HCoV-NL63 positive, 35 were with high loads, and of these 25 were single HCoV-NL63 infections. Based on the number of children with high HCoV-NL63 infection and no additional infection, the overall annual incidence in outpatients was 7 per 1000 children per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 3\u201313 per 1000 children per year), which can be extrapolated to an absolute number of 16,929 visits to the physician due to an HCoV-NL63 infection in Germany per year. The estimated hospitalization rate is 22 per 100,000 children (95% CI: 7\u201349 per 100,000 children per year). This number reflects 522 HCoV-NL63 children in Germany per year. A large year-to-year difference in HCoV-NL63 infection frequency was observed. Combining these data with those of other studies in Western Europe revealed that HCoV-NL63 infections follow a 2-year inter-epidemic period with peaks of infection in the winters of 2000/2001, 2002/2003 and 2004/2005 (p \u003C0.0001). Conclusions HCoV-NL63 infection in children below 3 years of age often requires a visit to the physician in an outpatient clinic, especially during peak-years, but hospitalizations are relatively infrequent.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Hoek, Lia; Ihorst, Gabriele; Sure, Klaus; Vabret, Astrid; Dijkman, Ronald; de Vries, Michel; Forster, Johannes; Berkhout, Ben; Uberla, Klaus","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5812874ab504cb809830a46d808d2cb81f56f73b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108429.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20347384/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210000958; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210000958; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.02.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRI.DE"],"locations":["Western Europe"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NL63 children","HCoV-NL63 infection frequency","high HCoV-NL63 infection","HCoV-NL63 positive","Conclusions HCoV-NL63 infection","single HCoV-NL63 infections","number of children","hospitalized children","cohort of children","frequency of infection","year difference","large year","additional infection","peaks of infection","years of age","peak-years","different years","year inter-epidemic period","consecutive years","respiratory samples","lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory viruses","disease burden","burden of disease","Germany","outpatient clinic","physician","absolute number","Western European studies","population-based","high loads","overall annual incidence","Study design","outpatients","LRTIs","confidence interval","Abstract Background","hospitalizations","visits","Results","estimated hospitalization rate","Objectives","winters","Sampling","data"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the in vitro bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 7% gargle/mouthwash at defined dilution against oral and respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: PVP-I was tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to bactericidal quantitative suspension test EN13727 and against severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), rotavirus strain Wa and influenza virus A subtype H1N1 according to virucidal quantitative suspension test EN14476. PVP-I 7% gargle/mouthwash was diluted 1:30 with water to a concentration of 0.23% (the recommended concentration for \u201Creal-life\u201D use in Japan) and tested at room temperature under clean conditions [0.3 g/l bovine serum albumin (BSA), viruses only] and dirty conditions (3.0 g/l BSA \u002B 3.0 ml/l erythrocytes) as an interfering substance for defined contact times (minimum 15 s). Rotavirus was tested without protein load. A \u2265 5 log(10) (99.999%) decrease of bacteria and \u2265 4 log(10) (99.99%) reduction in viral titre represented effective bactericidal and virucidal activity, respectively, per European standards. RESULTS: PVP-I gargle/mouthwash diluted 1:30 (equivalent to a concentration of 0.23% PVP-I) showed effective bactericidal activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza virus A (H1N1) and rotavirus after 15 s of exposure. CONCLUSION: PVP-I 7% gargle/mouthwash showed rapid bactericidal activity and virucidal efficacy in vitro at a concentration of 0.23% PVP-I and may provide a protective oropharyngeal hygiene measure for individuals at high risk of exposure to oral and respiratory pathogens.

Thus, chloroquine has found applications in autoimmune diseases where it apparently facilitates apoptosis of abnormally persistent T-cell clones. The mode of action of chloroquine in prevention of malaria is not known, but it may be to minimize replication of the parasite in the liver cells, which occurs before invasion of the erythrocytes, by facilitating premature apoptosis of the infected host cells. After introduction of chloroquine in the 1950s world-wide for prophylactic use, chloroquine-resistant malaria emerged. Here it is hypothesized that concurrent with emergence of chloroquine-resistant malaria (presumably with enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities), other intracellular parasites have evolved to enhance their ability to prevent apoptosis in host cells. Two examples of viral diseases that have emerged from areas of high incidence of chloroquine-resistant malaria are AIDS from HIV and SARS from coronavirus. The hypothesis holds that prophylactic exposure to pro-apoptotic chloroquine drugs caused natural selection for strains of viruses and other parasites that have enhanced anti-apoptotic abilities. When transmitted to host organisms that are not under the influence of the pro-apoptotic drug, the new \u201Canti-apoptotic\u201D strains may cause unexpected diseases. In the case of SARS, the coronavirus appears to have accessed a new niche where it proves to be lethal to its host. In the case of AIDS, the HIV (which has had a long-term symbiotic relationship with primates) has run amuck because the infected cells are now substantially more tolerant to the toxins (i.e., resistant to apoptosis) that they secrete than the uninfected bystander cells, which are not unusually resistant to apoptosis. A corollary to the hypothesis is that if the level of resistance to apoptosis in the infected cells were no higher than the level of resistance in the bystander cells, then the infected cells would preferentially kill themselves through apoptosis. It appears that in the case of HIV, the increased resistance to apoptosis is provided by expression of Bcl-2 and suppression of p53. Hence, drugs that suppresses Bcl-2 or restore p53 function might be effective in restoring the parity of resistance to apoptosis between infected and uninfected cells. Currently, an antisense drug targeting Bcl-2 (G3139/GenasenseTM, Genta, Inc.) is in late-stage cancer trials and may be on the market for those indications in months. It would be interesting to try these drugs against various intracellular parasites including HIV. This approach to prevent or eliminate active infections might be particularly attractive against a range of parasites (virus, bacteria, protozoa, fungus) when safe and effective vaccines are not available.","publish_time":"2004-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parris, George E","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8ddea0a1b578a5866bf204ff4450f902fb48829.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130919.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987703003815; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987703003815","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genta, Inc."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected host cells","T-cells","uninfected cells","chloroquine-resistant malaria","premature apoptosis","liver cells","pro-apoptotic chloroquine drugs","uninfected bystander cells","Abstract Chloroquine","emergence of chloroquine","introduction of chloroquine","anti-apoptotic abilities","expression of anti-apoptotic proteins","enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities","case of HIV","pro-apoptotic drug","level of resistance","expression of Bcl","related anti-malarial drugs","areas of high incidence of chloroquine","prevention of malaria","range of parasites","parity of resistance","increased resistance","case of AIDS","case of SARS","host organisms","various intracellular parasites","antisense drug targeting Bcl","autoimmune diseases","unexpected diseases","coronavirus","hypothesis","examples of viral diseases","prophylactic use","prophylactic exposure","strains of viruses","effective vaccines","new niche","p53 function","suppression of p53","persistent T-cell clones","fungus","s world-wide","bacteria","protozoa","G3139","influence","ability","late-stage cancer trials","NF-kappa","mode of action","long-term symbiotic relationship","market","active infections","primates","Genta","GenasenseTM","invasion","erythrocytes","applications","toxins","indications","months","approach","replication","corollary"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combined use of oral Azithromycin (AZT) plus Echinacea compared to exclusive use of AZT in children with recurrent tonsillitis. Material and methods A prospective comparative study including three groups of children with recurrent tonsillitis. Group 1: (100 patients) had no prophylactic treatment. Group 2 (100 patients) received [60 mg/kg] prophylactic dose of AZT divided as (10 mg/kg/day) over 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Group 3 (100 patients) received AZT as in group 2 plus commercially available Echinacea in a dose of 5 ml oral suspension; 3 times daily for 10 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of tonsillitis symptoms were assessed and compared in different groups. Results Group 2 and group 3 had significant less number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of assessed symptoms during 6 months of prophylactic treatment with significant better results in group 3 (i.e. AZT plus Echinacea) compared to group 2 (I.e.

Isothermal amplification assays will facilitate the development of portable point-of-care diagnostics that are crucial for management of emerging infections. The RT-LAMP assays are designed to amplify MERS-CoV genomic loci located within the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b genes and upstream of the E gene. Additionally we applied one-step strand displacement probes (OSD) for real-time sequence-specific verification of LAMP amplicons. Asymmetric amplification effected by incorporating a single loop primer in each assay accelerated the time-to-result of the OSD-RT-LAMP assays. The resulting assays could detect 0.02 to 0.2 plaque forming units (PFU) (5 to 50 PFU/ml) of MERS-CoV in infected cell culture supernatants within 30 to 50 min and did not cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhadra, Sanchita; Jiang, Yu Sherry; Kumar, Mia R.; Johnson, Reed F.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Ellington, Andrew D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b22c0d8cb7675bcc5aa283fe3bfef6c72052519.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4391951.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856093/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP assays","Isothermal amplification assays","resulting assays","detection of MERS","MERS-CoV genomic loci","OSD-RT","Asymmetric amplification","emerging human coronavirus","PFU","common human respiratory pathogens","single loop primer","management of emerging infections","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory illness","primer reverse transcription loop","real-time sequence-specific verification of LAMP amplicons","reported infections","care diagnostics","open reading frame","one-step strand displacement probes","infected cell culture supernatants","development of portable point","recent surge","ORF1b genes","light","plaque","E gene","mortality rate","units"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE To summarize chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the early stage of COVID-19 infection and provide a piece of reliable imaging evidence for initial screening and diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 10 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, we continuously observed chest CT imaging of 14 patients with clinically suspected new coronavirus infection in the two weeks after onset of symptoms. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, reticular pattern, and ground-glass mimic nodules in each patient\u0027s chest CT image were recorded. RESULTS We enrolled 14 patients, of which nine patients had the infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Five patients were highly suspected of infection. All cases had epidemiological evidence. GGO was a dominant imaging manifestation in the initial days of infection. GGO performance accounts for 40% in 1- 2 days, 90% in 3- 6 days, and 85% in 7- 10 days. With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT.

The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wathes, D.

However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals have been reported. In general, the clinical presentation of these respiratory viral infections in persons with HIV infection is similar to their presentation in individuals without HIV infection. The major exception is the occurrence of fulminant, and often fatal, disseminated adenovirus infection in adults and children with HIV disease. Despite these reports, no information is available regarding the frequency of moderate-to-severe respiratory viral illnesses in individuals with HIV infection. Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses in cohorts of HIV-infected adults and children are needed. Second, prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses for weeks and even months has been documented in HIV-infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIV-infected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus. Increased HIV replication in peripheral blood from adults following inactivated influenza vaccination has been reported. The impact of natural respiratory viral infection (and perhaps vaccination against these pathogens) on HIV replication and disease progression will be an important area of study.","publish_time":"1997-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"King, James C","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6568dd2c4fdc50f1614e96ed78f5fe37f3180ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119403.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934397800058; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934397800058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV infection","HIV-infected individuals","cohorts of HIV","HIV-infected adults","respiratory viral infections","Increased HIV replication","HIV disease progression","Prolonged respiratory viral shedding","severe respiratory viral illnesses","impact of natural respiratory viral infection","prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses","Abstract Respiratory viruses","fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses","Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses","adenovirus infection","respiratory syncytial virus","infection control","chronic viral infections","frequency of prolonged shedding","parainfluenza viruses","common infections","young children","RSV","frequency of moderate","inactivated influenza vaccination","nursing homes","clinical presentation","ubiquitous pathogens","child care centers","group foster homes","human immunodeficiency virus","important area of study","small newborn cohort study","implications","peripheral blood","medical facilities","persons","data","genetic material","humans","adenoviruses","T lymphoma cells","weeks","changes","occurrence of fulminant","population","months","indirect evidence","key areas","literature","major exception","information","review","exploration","reports","Therapies"],"language":"en"},

The distribution of DPP4 in the respiratory tract tissues of humans and camels reflects MERS-CoV tropism. Apart from dromedary camels, insectivorous bats are suggested as another natural reservoir for MERS-like-CoVs. In order to gain insight on the tropism of these viruses in bats, we studied the DPP4 distribution in the respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues of two frugivorous bat species (Epomophorus gambianus and Rousettus aegyptiacus) and two insectivorous bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus serotinus). In the frugivorous bats, DPP4 was present in epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the intestinal tract, similar to what has been reported for camels and humans. In the insectivorous bats, however, DPP4 expression in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was almost absent. The preferential expression of DPP4 in the intestinal tract of insectivorous bats, suggests that transmission of MERS-like-CoVs mainly occurs via the fecal-oral route. Our results highlight differences in the distribution of DPP4 expression among MERS-CoV susceptible species, which might influence variability in virus tropism, pathogenesis and transmission route.","publish_time":"2017-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widagdo, W.; Begeman, Lineke; Schipper, Debby; Run, Peter R. van; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Kley, Nils; Reusken, Chantal B.; Haagmans, Bart L.; van den Brand, Judith M.

A questionnaire was developed to identify risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection. Overall, the percentage of positive calves and farms was 38.8 and 68.2%, respectively. The SSU rRNA-based PCR identified two Cryptosporidium species, Cryptosporidium parvum (95.8%) and C. bovis (4.2%). Sequence analyses of the glycoprotein (gp60) gene revealed that all C. parvum isolates belonged to the subtype family IIa (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA16G3R1), with the exception of three isolates that belonged to the subtype family IId (IIdA20G1b and IIdA20). Mixed logistic regression results indicated that calves aged 15\u201321 days were more likely to be Cryptosporidium-positive. The risk of being positive was also significantly higher in herds from Central Sardinia and in farms using non-slatted flooring. In addition, the application of disinfectants and milk replacers was significantly associated with higher Cryptosporidium prevalence. In contrast, the risk of being positive was significantly reduced in halofuginone-treated calves. Our results reveal that a significant percentage of suckling calves are carriers of zoonotic subtypes of C. parvum. Thus, both healthy and diarrhoeic calves younger than 1 month may represent a risk for the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals.

Methods: We examined the clinical utility of indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing in adult lung transplant patients with suspected RVI, compared with serology and culture. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs (NT) were obtained to sample epithelial cells, followed by application of monoclonal antibody to respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1\u20133 and influenza A and B. The Bartels Respiratory Viral Detection kit was used with IFA results available within 24 hours. Results: Nine of 18 patients tested positive for RVI with influenza A (n = 8) and influenza B (n = 1) detected. The sensitivity of IFA (67%) was higher than that of cell culture (45%). With intensive supportive therapy, infection was self-limiting in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) Grade 0\u20132 patients.

While the two proteins display strong structural conservation and the mechanisms underlying membrane fusion are similar, they share no sequence similarity. Whether they are functionally interchangeable is currently unknown. In this study, we constructed scIAV-S, a single-cycle influenza A virus pseudotyped with the spike protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and demonstrated that this virus could infect cultured cells and trigger massive syncytium formation. Treatment with endocytosis inhibitors did not affect syncytium formation by infected cells. Moreover, the infectivity of scIAV-S was associated with the degree of cell adaptation of PEDV-S. Intriguingly, scIAV-S lacking functional neuraminidase (NA) exhibited substantially higher infectivity, suggesting a pivotal role of the sialic acid in the binding/entry of PEDV. Together, scIAV-S offers a robust platform for the investigation of the entry mechanism of PEDV or, possibly, of other coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2018-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wanitchang, Asawin; Saenboonrueng, Janya; Srisutthisamphan, Kanjana; Jongkaewwattana, Anan","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/930bd84af0014f5f1f24fd2bcd1245234feead5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087185.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30136251/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-4001-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of PEDV","infectivity of scIAV","influenza virus hemagglutinin","entry mechanism of PEDV","scIAV-S lacking functional neuraminidase","spike protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","viral membrane fusion proteins","degree of cell adaptation of PEDV","coronavirus spike protein","massive syncytium formation","cultured cells","higher infectivity","infected cells","single-cycle influenza","class","mechanisms","pivotal role","sialic acid","strong structural conservation","investigation","robust platform","endocytosis inhibitors","binding","sequence similarity","Treatment","study","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Findings The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22\u201364) of Singapore\u0027s capacity. This value is equivalent to 2\u00B78 (95% HPDI 1\u00B75\u20134\u00B74) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22\u201367) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18\u201368) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0\u201342) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. Interpretation Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

However, from about 2003 more stringent nonclinical testing guidelines were introduced for novel vaccines (and, in some cases, marketed vaccines attempting registration in new markets) given that vaccines are typically administered to healthy individuals, often infants. These safety considerations become even more important as technologies allowing the development of novel vaccine types are developed, such as DNA vaccines and those delivered in vector systems such as adenoviral vectors. The use of adjuvants other than the standard aluminum-based ones and novel delivery systems such as electrostimulation have also led to additional testing requirements.

Outbreaks of PWD result in weakened kits, increased mortality and reduced growth and welfare as well as considerable economic losses for the farmers. The syndrome is regarded as multifactorial with a complex etiology, and studies have focused on associations with environment, management and dam characteristics. The present study was conducted from May to June 2015 and included 70 dams with mink litters with and without PWD. The aims were to examine associations between PWD and mastitis (bacterial infection and histological signs of inflammation or other lesions in the mammary gland), and to examine associations between PWD and other dam-related characteristics (age, litter size, body mass index, and weight and number of active mammary glands of the dam). RESULTS: Using multivariable mixed logistic regression analyses with farm id as a random intercept, we found that the odds for PWD in the litter were significantly higher in 1 year old dams versus \u003E 1 year old (OR = 13.3, CI 2.0\u201390.2, P = 0.01), higher if litter size observed after birth was \u003E 5 kits versus \u2264 5 kits (OR = 16.5, CI 2.2\u2013123.7, P = 0.01), higher if the number of active mammary glands per kit was \u2264 1.5 versus \u003E 1.5 glands per kit (OR = 6.5, CI 1.2\u201336.0), P = 0.03), and higher in farms with high prevalence of PWD versus low prevalence (OR = 16.8, CI 2.9\u201397.6, P = 0.002). There were no significant associations between PWD and bacterial infection, histological signs of inflammation or other lesions of the mammary gland, body mass index or weight of mammary gland per kit.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is one of the most important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells (HCs) which its interaction with spike protein (SP) with a furin-cleavage site results in the SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Hence, in this review, we presented an overview on the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP. As several kinds of CoVs, from various genera, have at their S1/S2 binding site a preserved site, we further surveyed the role of furin cleavage site (FCS) on the life cycle of the CoV. Furthermore, we discussed that the small molecular inhibitors can limit the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP and can be used as potential therapeutic platforms to combat the spreading CoV epidemic. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for the development of potential drugs to promote targeting specific activities of the CoV were reviewed. In conclusion, this review may pave the way for providing useful information about different compounds involved in improving the effectiveness of CoV vaccine or drugs with minimum toxicity against human health.

METHODS: We developed and administered an online survey inviting institutions that perform RRs of diagnostic tests from all over the world.

Thus, a structured evaluation of the challenges and implications of the adoption of these RR methods is warranted.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arevalo-Rodriguez, Ingrid; Steingart, Karen R.; Tricco, Andrea C.; Nussbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Kaunelis, David; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; Baxter, Susan; Bossuyt, Patrick M.; Emparanza, Jos\u00E9 Ignacio; Zamora, Javier","journal":"BMC Med Res Methodol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35c6349b705f1bdfd74c050e25075dcbd6aec784.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220561.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01004-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic test RRs","RRs of diagnostic tests","synthesis of diagnostic evidence","published RRs","RESULTS","participants","setting of diagnostic test reviews","use of limits","RR methods","accelerated evidence synthesis","previous review","greater use of shortcuts","international survey","online survey","Rapid reviews","implementation","recent scoping review","important methodological challenges","automation of review tasks","time-consuming systematic reviews","methodological shortcut","structured evaluation","structured question","current practice","implications","institutions","efficient alternative","decision-making","adoption","Parallelization","starting point","strategy","demand","healthcare","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","scope","search","world"],"language":"en"},

Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviral\u2013borne Ace2 or shRNA\u2013Ace2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS. LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, Ang\u2013(1\u20137), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio. Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased Ang\u2013(1\u20137) levels, thus reducing LPS\u2013induced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects. A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2. LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NF\u2013\u03BAB pathways, which were aggravated by A779. Pretreatment with A779 prevented the Ace2\u2013induced blockade of p38, JNK, and NF\u2013\u03BAB phosphorylation.

By monitoring host serum antibodies to viral antigens, early virus detection within herds is feasible. In this study, recombinant antigens were generated using recombinant DNA techniques to fuse PRRSV structural protein (N) or nonstructural protein 1\u03B1 (nsp1\u03B1) with the Rellina luciferase gene. Next, fused genes were cloned into plasmids and transfected into HEK-293 T cells for transient expression. Upon co-incubation of lysates with pig sera, antigen-antibody complexes formed that bound to Protein-G coated onto microplates. By further measurement of luminance value, a modified form of Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems, namely luciferase-linked antibody capture assay (LACA) was developed for detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies. RESULTS: Known anti-PRRSV antibody-positive or -negative serum samples (125 and 122 samples, respectively) were used to validate the LACA and compared it with IDEXX PRRS \u00D73 ELISA. Based on the result, N-Rluc and nsp1\u03B1-Rluc LACA results were 95.3 and 94.4% in agreement with IDEXX ELISA, suggested a similar specificity of LACA to IDEXX ELISA. Moreover, when both LACA and IDEXX ELISA were used to evaluate sequential serum samples obtained from PRRSV experimentally infected pigs, the PRRSV-specific antibody response was detectable as early as 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) using N-Rluc LACA, but undetectable until 7 dpi using IDEXX ELISA, suggesting an improved sensitivity of LACA. Meanwhile, antibodies specific for nsp1\u03B1 were detected at higher levels overall, but were undetectable until 10 dpi. Furthermore,. Notably, one IDEXX ELISA positive result was not confirmed by LACA or IFA and was thus considered a false-positive result. CONCLUSION: The LACA exhibited similar specificity but improved sensitivity to that of the commercial IDEXX PRRS \u00D73 ELISA kit for detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies in pig serum. Importantly, LACA could be adapted for detecting antibodies against other PRRSV targets, such as nsp1\u03B1, to achieve earlier detection of PRRSV infection.","publish_time":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jie; Wang, Gang; Yang, Di; Zhao, Bao; Zhao, Yongpan; Liu, Yonggang; Cai, Xuehui; Nan, Yuchen; Zhou, En-Min; Wu, Chunyan","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7bf679ec25305b15089e89885f393de974be10d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6240198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445953/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-018-0483-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LACA","IDEXX ELISA","PRRSV","IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-Rluc LACA","PRRSV targets","IDEXX ELISA positive result","nsp1\u03B1-Rluc LACA results","similar specificity of LACA","improved sensitivity of LACA","PRRSV-specific antibody response","specific antibodies","antibodies specific","PRRSV structural protein","earlier detection of PRRSV infection","anti-PRRSV antibody-positive","ELISA kit","early virus detection","commercial IDEXX PRRS","pig serum","monitoring host serum antibodies","negative serum samples","sequential serum samples","Early detection of porcine reproductive","false-positive result","recombinant antigens","luciferase-linked antibody capture assay","nonstructural protein","antigen-antibody complexes","Protein-G","Rellina luciferase gene","viral antigens","pig sera","infection of swine","modified form of Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems","respiratory syndrome virus","recombinant DNA techniques","infected pigs","herds","co-incubation of lysates","HEK","T cells","measurement of luminance value","BACKGROUND","transient expression","higher levels","days post-inoculation","plasmids","CONCLUSION","devastating disease","fused genes","microplates","study","IFA","agreement"],"language":"en"},

Under explicit consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic infective individuals for the basic model without intervention the analysis shows that the dynamics of the epidemic is determined by a basic reproduction number R 0 . A disease-free and an endemic equilibrium exist and are locally asymptotically stable when R 0 \u003C 1 and R 0 \u003E 1 respectively. When treatment is included the system has a basic reproduction number, which is the largest of the two reproduction numbers that characterise the drug-sensitive ( R 1 ) or resistant ( R 2 ) strains of the infectious agent. The system has a disease-free equilibrium, which is stable when both R 1 and R 2 are less than unity. Two endemic equilibria also exist and are associated with treatment and the development of drug resistance. An endemic equilibrium where only the drug-resistant strain persists exists and is stable when R 2 \u003E 1 and R 1 \u003C R 2 . A second endemic equilibrium exists when R 1 \u003E 1 and R 1 \u003E R 2 and both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains are present.

The Cardiovirus genus consists two distinct species: Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theilovirus (ThV). There are a lot differences between the two species. In this study, the differences of codon usage in EMCV and ThV were compared. RESULTS: The mean ENC values of EMCV and ThV are 54.86 and 51.08 respectively, higher than 40.And there are correlations between (C\u002BG)(12)% and (C\u002BG)(3)% for both EMCV and ThV (r = -0.736;r = 0.986, P \u003C 0.01, repectively). For ThV the (C\u002BG)(12)%, (C\u002BG)(3)%, axis f\u0027(1 )and axis f\u0027(2 )had a significant correlations respectively but not for EMCV. According to the RSCU values, the EMCV species seemed to prefer U, G and C ending codon, while the ThV spice seemed to like using U and A ending codon. However, in both genus AGA for Arg, AUU for Ile, UCU for Ser, and GGA for Gly were chosen preferentially. Correspondence analysis detected one major trend in the first axis (f\u0027(1)) which accounted for 22.89% of the total variation, and another major trend in the second axis (f\u0027(2)) which accounted for 17.64% of the total variation. And the plots of the same serotype seemed at the same region at the coordinate. CONCLUSION: The overall extents of codon usage bias in both EMCV and ThV are low. The mutational pressure is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias, but the (C\u002BG) content plays a more important role in codon usage bias for ThV than for EMCV. The synonymous codon usage pattern in both EMCV and ThV genes is gene function and geography specific, but not host specific. Maybe the serotype is one factor effected the codon bias for ThV, and location has no significant effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes.","publish_time":"2011-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wen-qian; Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Yi-qiang; Zhou, Jian-hua; Chen, Hao-tai; Ma, Li-na; Ding, Yao-zhong; Liu, Yongsheng","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a730b4d5a5a0353503a1cd46d458635f93618805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3148564.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21708006/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMCV","UCU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codon bias","EMCV species","ThV genes","differences of codon usage","C ending codon","ThV spice","synonymous codon usage pattern","variations of synonymous codon usage","overall extents of codon usage bias","axis f","mean ENC values of EMCV","virus genes","distinct species","major trend","significant correlations","serotype","total variation","Encephalomyocarditis virus","main factor","geography specific","significant effect","genus AGA","RSCU values","Cardiovirus genus","lot differences","Picornaviridae family","positive-strand RNA viruses","AUU","gene function","important role","mammals","UCU","Ile","Cardioviruses","Arg","location","pigs","enteric infection","content","Theilovirus","rodents","lower frequencies","human beings","GGA","BACKGROUND","mutational pressure","RESULTS","Correspondence analysis","CONCLUSION","study","Gly","region","coordinate","plots"],"language":"en"},

Here, one of these proteins, called 7b (206 residues), was investigated using a reverse genetic approach established for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79\u20131146. Recombinant FIPVs (rFPIVs) expressing mutant and/or FLAG-tagged forms of 7b were generated and used to investigate the expression, processing, glycosylation, localization and trafficking of the 7b protein in rFIPV-infected cells, focusing on a previously predicted ER retention signal, KTEL, at the C-terminus of 7b. The study revealed that 7b is N-terminally processed by a cellular signalase. The cleavage site, 17-Ala|Thr-18, was unambiguously identified by N-terminal sequence analysis of a 7b processing product purified from rFIPV-infected cells. Based on this information, rFIPVs expressing FLAG-tagged 7b proteins were generated and the effects of substitutions in the C-terminal (202)KTEL(206) sequence were investigated. The data show that (i) 7b localizes to and is retained in the medial- and/or trans-Golgi compartment, (ii) the C-terminal KTEL sequence acts as a Golgi [rather than an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)] retention signal, (iii) minor changes in the KTEL motif (such as KTE, KTEV, or the addition of a C-terminal tag) abolish Golgi retention, resulting in relocalization and secretion of 7b, and (iv) a KTEL-to-KDEL replacement causes retention of 7b in the ER of rFIPV-infected feline cells. Taken together, this study provides interesting new insights into an efficient Golgi retention signal that controls the cellular localization and trafficking of the FIPV 7b protein in virus-infected feline cells.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Florek, Dominik; Ehmann, Rosina; Kristen-Burmann, Claudia; Lemmermeyer, Tanja; Lochnit, G\u00FCnter; Ziebuhr, John; Thiel, Heinz-J\u00FCrgen; Tekes, Gergely","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d016a1de400ba433fd07486799707afeead88ab6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28758629/; https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000879","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KTEL","KTE","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["b proteins","b processing product","rFIPV-infected cells","virus-infected feline cells","C-terminal KTEL sequence acts","efficient Golgi retention signal","predicted ER retention signal","ER of rFIPV","KTEL motif","C-terminal tag","Feline coronaviruses","N-terminal sequence analysis","C-terminus","feline infectious peritonitis virus","trafficking","trans-Golgi compartment","cellular localization","accessory proteins","FLAG","study","cellular signalase","interesting new insights","reverse genetic approach","addition","minor changes","endoplasmic reticulum","strain","glycosylation","relocalization","KDEL replacement","effects of substitutions","Recombinant FIPVs","rFPIVs","KTEV","elusive functions","expression","rFIPVs","secretion","cleavage site","Thr","information","forms","residues","data"],"language":"en"},

These viruses are a threat not only for animal health but also public health due to their zoonotic potential. The domestic duck plays a major role in the epidemiological cycle of influenza virus subtypes H5 but little is known concerning host/pathogen interactions during influenza infection in duck species. In this study, a subtracted library from duck trachea (a primary site of influenza virus infection) was constructed to analyse and compare the host response after a highly or low pathogenic (LP) H5N1-infection. RESULTS: Here, we show that more than 200 different genes were differentially expressed in infected duck trachea to a significant degree. In addition, significant differentially expressed genes between LPAI- and HPAI-infected tracheas were observed. Gene ontology annotation was used and specific signalling pathways were identified. These pathways were different for LPAI and HPAI-infected tracheas, except for the CXCR4 signalling pathway which is implicated in immune response. A different modulation of genes in the CXCR4 signalling pathway and TRIM33 was induced in duck tracheas infected with a HPAI- or a LPAI-H5N1. CONCLUSION: First, this study indicates that Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) is an alternative approach to gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza infection in ducks. Secondly, the results indicate that cellular gene expression in the duck trachea was differently modulated after infection with a LPAI-H5N1 or after infection with a HPAI-H5N1 virus. Such difference found in infected trachea, a primary infection site, could precede continuation of infection and could explain appearance of respiratory symptoms or not.","publish_time":"2013-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massin, Pascale; Deleage, Claire; Oger, Aur\u00E9lie; Briand, Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier; Quenault, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Blanchard, Yannick","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d7aeae7fc9f39f80a461b590c16fd9ea37aa9d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3848638.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24015922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H5N1-infection","infected duck trachea","pathogenesis of influenza infection","continuation of infection","duck tracheas","LPAI-H5N1","primary infection site","primary site of influenza virus infection","HPAI-infected tracheas","HPAI-H5N1 virus","duck species","domestic duck","Avian influenza","different genes","epidemiological cycle of influenza virus subtypes H5","CXCR4 signalling pathway","viruses of subtypes H5","different modulation of genes","specific signalling pathways","study","host response","RESULTS","public health","animal health","significant degree","immune response","cellular gene expression","Gene ontology annotation","serious disease outbreaks","panzootic","gain insights","major role","pathogen interactions","SSH","alternative approach","poultry","TRIM33","Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization","subtracted library","zoonotic potential","appearance of respiratory symptoms","BACKGROUND","threat","ducks","addition","difference","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to evaluate the effect of an oral bacteriophage cocktail on fecal E. coli colony-forming units (CFU). Ten calves were enrolled in the study to either the bacteriophage group or the placebo group for 22 feedings. Calves in the bacteriophage treatment group (n = 6) received a total of 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU) (volume = 5 ml) of each of four bacteriophages while the placebo group (n = 4) received only phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml).

MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models. Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied. Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons. Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case. Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected. Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future. The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor. Overall, there are many unknown/confirmed aspects of the virus/human/animal network. Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented. Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir/s are of high priority.

Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 were highly similar (95 and 93% amino acid identity, respectively) with the Ace genes of Tribolium castaneum. Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 have the conserved residues characteristic of AChE (catalytic triad, intra\u2010disulfide bonds, and so on). Partial cDNA sequences of the Alphitobius Ace genes were compared between two tetrachlorvinphos resistant (Kennebec and Waycross) and one susceptible strain of beetles. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, but only one non\u2010synonymous mutation was found (A271S in AdAce2). No SNPs were exclusively found in the resistant strains, the A271S mutation does not correspond to any mutations previously reported to alter sensitivity of AChE to organophosphates or carbamates, and the A271S was found only as a heterozygote in one individual from one of the resistant A. diaperinus strains.

However, increasing sectors of the population have expressed hesitancy about participating in such programs, leading to the re-emergence of vaccine preventable diseases. In this study we rely on a recreancy hypothesis to test the association between confidence in the government and local hospitals and the willingness to take the vaccine. Methods A secondary analysis of a survey that used a large sample of the U.S. population conducted in October 2009 was used (N = 968). Results The results indicate that 36.1% of the respondents expressed willingness to be vaccinated. Those with the greatest trust in the government were the most likely to be vaccinated (43.4%), and those least confident were the least willing (15.8%). From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government\u0027s technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures.

Two relatively prevalent HLA alleles HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*6802, are classified into the same serotype HLA-A68. However, based on their distinct peptide-binding characteristics, HLA-A*6801 is grouped into A3 supertype, whereas HLA-A*6802 belongs to A2 supertype, similar to HLA-A*0201. Thusfar, the structural basis of the different supertype definitions of these serotyping-identical HLA alleles remains largely unknown. Herein, we determined the structures of HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*6802 presenting three typical A3 and A2 supertype-restricted peptides, respectively. The binding capabilities of these peptides to HLA-A*6801, HLA-A*6802, and HLA-A*0201 were analyzed. These data indicate that the similar conformations of the residues within the F pocket contribute to close-related peptide binding features of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201. However, the overall structure and the peptide conformation of HLA-A*6802 are more similar to HLA-A*6801 rather than HLA-A*0201 which illuminates the similar serotype grouping of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801.

Clearly, an understanding of the underlying immunology of the male reproductive tract is crucial to resolving these superficially incompatible observations. One important consideration must be the very different immunological environments of the testis, where sperm develop, and the epididymis, where sperm mature and are stored. Compared with the elaborate blood\u2010testis barrier, the tight junctions of the epididymis are much less effective. Unlike the seminiferous epithelium, immune cells are commonly observed within the epithelium, and can even be found within the lumen, of the epididymis. Crucially, there is little evidence for extended allograft survival (immune privilege) in the epididymis, as it exists in the testis, and the epididymis is much more susceptible to loss of immune tolerance. Moreover, the incidence of epididymitis is considerably greater than that of orchitis in humans, and susceptibility to sperm antibody formation after damage to the epididymis or vas deferens increases with increasing distance of the damage from the testis. Although we still know relatively little about testicular immunity, we know less about the interactions between the epididymis and the immune system. Given that the epididymis appears to be more susceptible to inflammation and immune reactions than the testis, and thereby represents the weaker link in protecting developing sperm from the immune system, it is probably time this imbalance in knowledge was addressed.","publish_time":"2013-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedger, Mark P.","journal":"J Androl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4329f632461790f1c80ef2cc8d2298a3b5d9dffe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166903.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764900/; https://doi.org/10.2164/jandrol.111.012989","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epididymis","immune cells","immune privilege","immune reactions","host immune system","loss of immune tolerance","testis barrier","developing sperm","damage","male reproductive tract","male reproductive function","sperm antibody formation","ability of systemic inflammation","ability of spermatogenic cells","intriguing conundrums of male reproduction","little evidence","seminiferous epithelium","susceptibility","increasing distance","extended allograft survival","vas deferens increases","humans","underlying immunology","tight junctions","different immunological environments","elaborate blood","weaker link","orchitis","ABSTRACT","important consideration","incidence of epididymitis","incompatible observations","understanding","testicular immunity","interactions","imbalance","knowledge","lumen"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory specimens were retrospectively screened for 20 respiratory viruses by real\u2010time PCR. The HAdV hexon gene was amplified and directly sequenced, and HAdV types were identified by performing Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. HAdV DNA was detected in 27 (3.6%) patients, with peaks in November and March. Most patients were infants and young children suffering from pneumonia or acute bronchiolitis. The detected HAdV types were C1, C2, C5, B3, and B7. Clusters of HAdV C1, C2, and C5 were observed with high posterior probability. All patients infected with HAdV C5 and 50% of patients infected with HAdV C2 or B7 were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Co\u2010infection with other viruses was detected in 44.4% of patients. The most common co\u2010infecting virus was rhinovirus (HRV). HAdV/HRV co\u2010infection was detected in two children who presumably developed disseminated HAdV infection and died. This is the first report describing the circulation of HAdV types associated with severe outcomes in Kuwait.

The heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as a cellular receptor. Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an \u03B11,2-fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies. The model indicated that the ABO polymorphism could contribute to substantially reduce the virus transmission, affecting both the number of infected individuals and the kinetics of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2008-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guillon, Patrice; Cl\u00E9ment, Monique; S\u00E9bille, V\u00E9ronique; Rivain, Jean-G\u00E9rard; Chou, Chih-Fong; Ruvo\u00EBn-Clouet, Nathalie; Le Pendu, Jacques","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/507f7b497146574eef677bc28cca3b8403aed36d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18818423/; https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwn093","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABH","ABO"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["S protein","enzyme","angiotensin","ABO polymorphism","protective effect of ABO natural antibodies","protein binds","ABO system","S glycoprotein ectodomain","virus transmission dynamics","cellular model of adhesion","epidemiology of SARS","mathematical model","pathogenic emergent virus","order","interaction","cellular receptor","glycosylated SARS-CoV spike","blood group O","chinese hamster ovary cells","potential effect","dependent adhesion","cell surface","cell line","ABH histo-blood group antigens","account","Hong Kong","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","hospital outbreak","kinetics","number of infected individuals","\u03B11","EGFP","Epidemiological analysis","low risk of infection","epidemic","fucosyltransferase","aim","study","protection"],"language":"en"},

Bronchoscopy with targeted bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often used in AHSCT patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) to help guide management. Aim To evaluate how positive BAL results change antimicrobial management of AHSCT recipients with suspected LRTI. Methods We performed a retrospective review of BAL results from January 2014 to July 2016 for 54 AHSCT recipients. A positive BAL was determined by culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA), and cytology. Findings BAL was positive for infectious etiologies in 63%, and antimicrobials were adjusted in 48/54 (89%) of patients. Antibacterial escalation was predicted by a positive BAL bacterial culture (OR 7.61, P=0.017). Antibiotic de-escalation was more likely with an elevated AGA (OR 3.86, P=0.035). Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P=0.010). Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P=0.020). The patients with a negative BAL were more likely to be started on steroids (OR 0.19, P= 0.043). Conclusions BAL was helpful to determine the etiology of pulmonary complications and optimize antimicrobials. The addition of AGA and multiplex PCR to standard BAL significantly impacted de-escalating antibiotics and adjusting antifungals to provide adequate coverage.

Areas covered: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers. The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-\u03B12b (IFN-\u03B12b) injection via aerosol. Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed. Expert opinion: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious. They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown. It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients. IFN-\u03B12b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection. Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo. The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ling; Xu, Xiaopeng; Ruan, Junshan; Lin, Saijin; Jiang, Jinhua; Ye, Hong","journal":"Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f83f7ac7fb1a45b7167eb5a23e7a309ec9b2366.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362193/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1758066","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic patients","Chinese patients","ritonavir tablets","arbidol tablets","IFN-\u03B12b","effective drug","special asymptomatic couple","confirmed infection","COVID","medication","novel coronavirus","early stage of virus infection","large-scale interpersonal infection","evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules","recombinant human interferon-\u03B12b","drug interactions","combinations of lopinavir","clinical experts","clinical characteristics","epidemic stage","Arbidol instruction dose","various viral infections","intercity bus driver","likely drugs","male patient","paper","quadruple therapy","hyperlipidemia","hyperglycemia","injection","arguments","aerosol","Introduction","Expert opinion","treatment","passengers","Wuhan","Areas"],"language":"en"},

Methods One hundred and eighty-three patients diagnosed with pulmonary infections in an ER were divided into an acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive, active PTB group (G1=84) and a non-AFB smear-positive, pulmonary infection group (G2=99). HRCT images from a 64-Multidetector CT were analyzed, retrospectively, for the morphology, number, and segmental distribution of pulmonary lesions. Results Utilizing multivariate analysis, five variables were found to be independent risk factors predictive of G1: (1) consolidation involving the apex segment of right upper lobe, posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe; (2) consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe; (3) presence of a cavitary lesion; (4) presence of clusters of nodules; (5) absence of centrilobular nodules. A G1 prediction score was generated based on these 5 criteria to help differentiate G1 from G2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96\u00B10.012 in our prediction model. With an ideal cut-off point score of 3, the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) are 90.9%, 96.4%, 90.0% and 96.8%, respectively. Conclusion The use of this AFB smear-positive, active PTB prediction model based on 5 key HRCT findings may help ER physicians determine whether or not isolation is required while awaiting serial sputum smear results in high risk patients.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeh, Jun Jun; Yu, Joseph Kwong-Leung; Teng, Wen-Bao; Chou, Chun-Hsiung; Hsieh, Shih-Peng; Lee, Tsung-Lung; Wu, Ming-Ting","journal":"European Journal of Radiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ba43b027d5621418b5c740c96a748c4721a6824.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127118.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.09.040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X10004973; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X10004973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21030177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-AFB smear-positive","pulmonary infections","positive predictive value","apex segment of right upper lobe","active pulmonary tuberculosis","left upper lobe","G1 prediction score","active PTB prediction model","active PTB group","pulmonary infection group","superior segment","lower lobe","apico-posterior segment","serial sputum smear results","independent risk factors predictive of G1","negative predictive value","segmental distribution of pulmonary lesions","ER physicians","HRCT images","consolidation","G2","key HRCT findings","high risk patients","presence of clusters","absence of centrilobular nodules","use of high-resolution computed tomography","ideal cut-off point score","PPV","specificity","study","variables","emergency room","sensitivity","acid fast bacillus","characteristic","receiver","isolation","number","ROC","curve","morphology","multivariate analysis","Abstract Purpose","setting","cavitary lesion","NPV","Conclusion","Multidetector CT","area","criteria","Methods"],"language":"en"},

These challenges include a thorough evaluation of the microbiological safety of the islets. In this study, we describe a robust porcine islet\u2010screening program that provides a high level of confidence in the microbiological safety of porcine islets suitable for clinical trials. METHODS: A four\u2010checkpoint program systematically screens the donor herd (Large White \u2013 Yorkshire \u00D7 Landrace F1 hybrid animals), individual sentinel and pancreas donor animals and, critically, the islet macrobeads themselves. Molecular assays screen for more than 30 known viruses, while electron microscopy and in vitro studies are employed to screen for potential new or divergent (emergent) viruses. RESULTS: Of 1207 monthly samples taken from random animals over a 2\u2010year period, only a single positive result for Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was observed, demonstrating the high level of biosecurity maintained in the source herd. Given the lack of clinical signs, positive antibody titers for Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Porcine parvovirus, and Influenza A confirm the efficacy of the herd vaccination program. Porcine respiratory coronavirus was found to be present in the herd, as expected for domestic swine. Tissue homogenate samples from six sentinel and 11 donor animals, over the same 2\u2010year period, were negative for the presence of viruses when co\u2010cultured with six different cell lines from four species. The absence of adventitious viruses in separate islet macrobead preparations produced from 12 individual pancreas donor animals was confirmed using validated molecular (n = 32 viruses), in vitro culture (cells from four species), and transmission electron microscopy assays (200 cell profiles per donor animal) over the same 2\u2010year period. There has been no evidence of viral transmission following the implantation of these same encapsulated and functional porcine islets into non\u2010immunosuppressed diabetic cynomolgus macaques for up to 4 years. Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all time points were negative for PCV (Type 2), PLHV, PRRSV, PCMV, and PERV\u2010A, PERV\u2010B, and PERV\u2010C by PCR analysis in all six recipient animals. CONCLUSION: The four\u2010checkpoint program is a robust and reliable method for characterization of the microbiological safety of encapsulated porcine islets intended for clinical trials.","publish_time":"2016-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gazda, Lawrence S.; Collins, James; Lovatt, Archie; Holdcraft, Robert W.; Morin, Merribeth J.; Galbraith, Daniel; Graham, Melanie; Laramore, Melissa A.; Maclean, Christine; Black, John; Milne, Euan W.; Marthaler, Douglas G.; Vinerean, Horatiu V.; Michalak, Michelle M.; Hoffer, Deborah; Richter, Steven; Hall, Richard D.; Smith, Barry H.","journal":"Xenotransplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9cb7666b0c0ba3ad39d782a78d4fcd97d235176.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169751.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/xen.12277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functional porcine islets","use of porcine islets","robust porcine islet","Porcine parvovirus","donor herd","microbiological safety of encapsulated porcine islets","microbiological safety of porcine islets suitable","individual pancreas donor animals","Porcine respiratory coronavirus","random animals","recipient animals","known viruses","presence of viruses","checkpoint program","herd vaccination program","year period","screening program","clinical trials","islet \u03B2","islet macrobeads","source herd","absence of adventitious viruses","Landrace F1 hybrid animals","individual sentinel","transmission electron microscopy assays","species","Molecular assays screen","separate islet macrobead preparations","respiratory syndrome virus","lack of clinical signs","high level of confidence","high level of biosecurity","cell profiles","treatment of type","distinct challenges","monthly samples","Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells","positive antibody titers","single positive result","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","different cell lines","evidence of viral transmission","Tissue homogenate samples","Yorkshire","non\u2010immunosuppressed diabetic cynomolgus macaques","Large White","time points","characterization","reliable method","insulin","implantation","diabetogenic disease process","PLHV","therapeutic reality","option","PCV","PCR analysis","Influenza","efficacy","thorough evaluation","PRRSV","studies","culture","BACKGROUND","PCMV","years","diabetes","RESULTS","domestic swine","METHODS","CONCLUSION","study"],"language":"en"},

We exploited the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic-reference population to map genetic modifiers that affect the severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection. Screening for P. aeruginosa respiratory infection in a cohort of 39 CC lines exhibits distinct disease phenotypes ranging from complete resistance to lethal disease. Based on major changes in the survival times, a quantitative-trait locus (QTL) was mapped on murine chromosome 3 to the genomic interval of Mb 110.4 to 120.5. Within this locus, composed of 31 protein-coding genes, two candidate genes, namely, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (Dpyd) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1pr1), were identified according to the level of genome-wide significance and disease gene prioritization. Functional validation of the S1pr1 gene by pharmacological targeting in C57BL/6NCrl mice confirmed its relevance in P. aeruginosa pathophysiology. However, in a cohort of Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) disease, regional genetic-association analysis of the syntenic human locus on chromosome 1 (Mb 97.0 to 105.0) identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10875080 and rs11582736) annotated to the Dpyd gene that were significantly associated with age at first P. aeruginosa infection. Thus, there is evidence that both genes might be implicated in this disease. Our results demonstrate that the discovery of murine modifier loci may generate information that is relevant to human disease progression.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lor\u00E8, Nicola Ivan; Sipione, Barbara; He, Gengming; Strug, Lisa J.; Atamni, Hanifa J.; Dorman, Alexandra; Mott, Richard; Iraqi, Fuad A.; Bragonzi, Alessandra","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e318909c13dd6bd6c96c47d9e7b7ac1c341936e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7064750.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00097-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32127447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lethal disease","disease gene prioritization","human disease progression","aeruginosa infection","distinct disease phenotypes","contributions of disease modifiers","aeruginosa respiratory infection","genetic modifiers","S1pr1 gene","Dpyd gene","aeruginosa pathophysiology","syntenic human locus","murine chromosome","candidate genes","Human genetics","severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection","quantitative-trait locus","protein-coding genes","regional genetic-association analysis","mouse genetic-reference population","clinical phenotypes","CC lines","respiratory infections","cohort of Canadian patients","genomic interval of Mb","discovery of murine modifier loci","CF","cystic fibrosis","pharmacological targeting","C57BL","range of pathological","wide significance","information","complete resistance","survival times","sphingosine","NCrl mice","rs11582736","dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase","QTL","rs10875080","relevance","level of genome","Collaborative Cross","single-nucleotide polymorphisms","Functional validation","major changes","phosphate receptor","Screening","age","results","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Objective: This study was a comprehensive economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of using the IBS for single-donor apheresis platelets (AP) and random-donor pooled platelet concentrates (PC) versus AP and PC without the IBS in the United States in patient populations in which platelets are commonly transfused. Methods: All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literature-based decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for several conditions and procedures that account for a considerable proportion of the platelet usage in the United States: acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, coronary artery bypass graft, and hip arthroplasty Risks of infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, or bacterial agents were incorporated into the model. Possible benefits of reduction of the risk of emerging HCV like pathogens and elimination of the need for gamma irradiation were explored in sensitivity analyses. Results: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by using AP \u002B IBS versus untreated AP ranged from $1,308,833 to $4,451,650 (without bacterial testing) and $4,759,401 to $22,968,066 (with bacterial testing). Corresponding figures for PC \u002B IBS versus untreated PC ranged from $457,586 to $1,816,060. Inclusion of emerging HCV like virus and the elimination of the need for gamma irradiation improved the cost-effectiveness to a range of $177,695 to $1,058,127 for AP without bacterial testing, $176,572 to $1,330,703 for AP with bacterial testing, and $22,888 to $153,564 for PC. The model was most likely to be affected by mortality from bacterial contamination, IBS effect on platelet utilization, and the inclusion of potential benefits (ie, gamma irradiation and/or emergent HCVlike virus). The model was relatively insensitive to changes in the IBS price and viral transmission risks. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of pathogen inactivation via the IBS for platelets is comparable to that of other accepted blood safety interventions (eg, nucleic acid amplification technology). The IBS for platelets may be considered a desirable strategy to increase the safety of platelet transfusions and a potential insurance against the threat of emerging pathogens.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bell, Christopher E.; Botteman, Marc F.; Gao, Xin; Weissfeld, Joel L.; Postma, Maarten J.; Pashos, Chris L.; Triulzi, Darrell; Staginnus, Ulf","journal":"Clinical Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b757b63173908e7dcd256e72ede22d6db7ea780a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291803802886; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291803802886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBS","AP","Baxter Healthcare Corporation","Cerus Corporation","AP   IBS"],"locations":["Illinois","California","United States"],"keyphrases":["IBS effect","IBS price","bacterial testing","untreated AP","use of AP","untreated PC","bacterial contamination","bacterial agents","gamma irradiation","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus","safety of platelet transfusions","Inclusion of emerging HCV","platelet usage","platelet utilization","emergent HCVlike virus","risk of emerging HCV","pathogen transmission risks","single-donor apheresis platelets","elimination","United States","cost-effectiveness of pathogen inactivation","need","viral transmission risks","threat of emerging pathogens","inclusion of potential benefits","data","random-donor pooled platelet concentrates","human T-cell lymphotropic virus type","comprehensive economic analysis","literature-based decision-analytic model","hip arthroplasty Risks of infection","potential insurance","Cerus Corporation","accepted blood safety interventions","economic costs","Baxter Healthcare Corporation","Intercept Blood System","Possible benefits of reduction","non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma","coronary artery bypass graft","HIV","acute lymphocytic leukemia","Illinois","Chicago","file","quality-adjusted life-year","incremental cost","considerable proportion","procedures","mortality","patient populations","nucleic acid amplification technology","clinical outcomes","account","MEDLINE","Concord","Abstract Background","study","existing published sources","desirable strategy","Corresponding figures","Results","California","Conclusions","conditions","sensitivity analyses","range","Objective","Methods"],"language":"en"},

This is particularly true in terms of transport and of protein sorting. For example, the question how cargo proteins are transported through this organelle is still a matter of debate. Emphasis has been put on the role of anterograde and retrograde transport vesicles. These have been proposed to carry cargo from cisterna to cisterna and to recycle components needed for further rounds of transport. Alternatively, anterograde movement of cargo takes place in cisternal membranes rather than transport vesicles. These membranes assemble and mature in a cis to trans direction. In this case, retrograde transport vesicles need to recycle all components of the Golgi apparatus and this demands a highly dynamic and efficient sorting machinery. Here we will discuss possible mechanisms for protein sorting in the context of cisternal maturation and propose that a common mechanism is sufficient to explain both transport of cargo and sorting of resident proteins.","publish_time":"1998-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"F\u00FCllekrug, Joachim; Nilsson, Tommy","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b1d99b4ffc25a1c74d8db98063c690dd02a8e2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127375.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488998000482; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488998000482","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cell Biology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transport of cargo","retrograde transport vesicles","terms of transport","rounds of transport","protein sorting","cargo proteins","anterograde movement of cargo","sorting of resident proteins","cisternal membranes","components","efficient sorting machinery","Golgi apparatus","role of anterograde","context of cisternal maturation","place","major challenge","common mechanism","organelle","field of Cell Biology","possible mechanisms","years","example","question","case","trans direction","matter of debate","Emphasis"],"language":"en"},

Currently there are no effective treatments or vaccines for PDCoV. In particular, the pathogenesis of PDCoV infection is still largely unknown. In this study, we reported that inoculating conventional weaned piglets with 1 \u00D7 109 TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain by oral feeding could cause severe diarrhea. Virus RNA was detected in rectal swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation. In addition, microscopic lesions in small intestine were observed, and viral antigen also detected in the small intestines with PDCoV immunohistochemical staining. Importantly, PDCoV significantly induced mRNA expression of TLR3, IL-12, IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, and PKR, the genes involved in modulation of the host immune responses, in infected Peyer\u0027s patches at 3 d.p.i., indicating that Peyer\u0027s patches play an important role in PDCoV immune responses in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that the observed gene expression profile might help explain immunological and pathological changes associated with PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zhichao; Zhong, Huiling; Huang, Songjian; Zhou, Qingfeng; Du, Yunping; Chen, Li; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cca222b4308f19b432c1d9ebbdafa7bb584595c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117130.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.12.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518311015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593372/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518311015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV immune responses","pathogenesis of PDCoV infection","PDCoV CHN-GD","PDCoV immunohistochemical staining","host immune responses","infected Peyer\u0027s patches","watery diarrhea","small intestines","severe diarrhea","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03B1","observed gene expression profile","conventional weaned piglets","induced mRNA expression of TLR3","significant economic losses","results","strain","important role","identified swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","oral feeding","modulation","TCID50","rectal swabs","pathological changes","pig industry","PKR","addition","microscopic lesions","viral antigen","days post inoculation","Virus RNA","findings","effective treatments","vaccines","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","study"],"language":"en"},

PEDV causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration in nursing piglets, which leads to significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Stress granules (SGs) are sites of mRNA storage that are formed under various stress conditions including viral infections. Increasing evidence suggests that SGs function in antiviral innate immunity of host cells to limit virus replication. Ras-GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a key stress granule-resident protein that nucleates stress granule assembly. Depletion of G3BP1 inhibits SGs formation and overexpression of G3BP1 nucleates SGs assembly. We observed that knockdown of G3BP1 by silencing RNA significantly increased PEDV replication. Overexpression of exogenous G3BP1, on the other hand, lowered virus replication by 100-fold compared to vector control. An increase in the levels of mRNAs of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) was also observed in PEDV-infected G3BP1 depleted cells compared to PEDV-infected control cells.

In children, a chronic cough (\u003E4 weeks) is associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. One common cause of childhood chronic cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), especially in children aged \u003C6 years. PBB is characterized by a chronic wet or productive cough without signs of an alternative cause and responds to 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, such as amoxicillin\u2010clavulanate. Most children with PBB are unable to expectorate sputum. If bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are performed, evidence of bronchitis and purulent endobronchial secretions are seen. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens typically reveal marked neutrophil infiltration and culture large numbers of respiratory bacterial pathogens, especially Haemophilus influenzae. Although regarded as having a good prognosis, recurrences are common and if these are frequent or do not respond to antibiotic treatments of up to 4\u2010weeks duration, the child should be investigated for other causes of chronic wet cough, such as bronchiectasis. The contribution of airway malacia and pathobiologic mechanisms of PBB remain uncertain and, other than reduced alveolar phagocytosis, evidence of systemic, or local immune deficiency is lacking. Instead, pulmonary defenses show activated innate immunity and increased gene expression of the interleukin\u20101\u03B2 signalling pathway. Whether these changes in local inflammatory responses are cause or effect remains to be determined. It is likely that PBB and bronchiectasis are at the opposite ends of the same disease spectrum, so children with chronic wet cough require close monitoring.

The peptide RB19, which contains an arginine residue plus the 5B19 epitope fused to the CP (TMV-RB19), resulted in the induction of necrotic local lesions on inoculated leaves of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and cell death of infected BY2 protoplasts.

Demyelination is an acquired disorder in which normally formed myelin degenerates, exposing axons to the extracellular environment. The result is dysfunction of normal neuron-to-neuron communication and in many cases, varying degrees of axonal degeneration. Numerous central nervous system demyelinating disorders exist, including multiple sclerosis. Although demyelination is the major manifestation of most of the demyelinating diseases, recent studies have clearly documented concomitant axonal loss to varying degrees resulting in long-term disability. Axonal injury may occur secondary to myelin damage (outside-in model) or myelin damage may occur secondary to axonal injury (inside-out model). Viral induced demyelination models, has provided unique imminent into the cellular mechanisms of myelin destruction. They illustrate mechanisms of viral persistence, including latent infections, virus reactivation and viral-induced tissue damage. These studies have also provided excellent paradigms to study the interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). In this review we will discuss potential cellular and molecular mechanism of central nervous system axonal loss and demyelination in a viral induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis.","publish_time":"2010-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das Sarma, Jayasri","journal":"Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed41111b7ec211ae5ad254835306b8a92567411d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2905936.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2010/109239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20652053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["myelin damage","Axonal injury","Numerous central nervous system","molecular mechanism of central nervous system axonal loss","Viral induced demyelination models","viral-induced tissue damage","concomitant axonal loss","immune system","viral induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis","cellular mechanisms of myelin destruction","varying degrees of axonal degeneration","mechanisms of viral persistence","formed myelin degenerates","peripheral nervous systems","axons","neuron communication","recent studies","demyelinating diseases","dysfunction of normal neuron","virus reactivation","latent infections","cases","disorders","rapid propagation of neuronal action potentials","acquired disorder","interactions","insulating sheath","major manifestation","excellent paradigms","result","CNS","extracellular environment","long-term disability","review"],"language":"en"},

Sections of bbHCV\u2010infected human fetal liver stem cells (hFLSCs) revealed convolution and nonlinear ER, cell vacuolization, swelling of mitochondria, and numerous double membrane vesicles (DMVs). The percentage of apoptotic hFLSCs infected by bbHCV reached 29.8% at 16 h postinfection, and the amount of cytochrome c increased remarkably in the cytosolic protein fraction. However, over time, apoptosis was inhibited due to the activation of NF\u2010\u03BAB. The expression of NF\u2010\u03BAB\u2010p65, Bcl\u2010xL, XIAP, and c\u2010FLIPL in hFLSCs was increased significantly 24 h after in infection by bbHCV. The accelerated cell death cycles involving apoptosis, regeneration and repair by bbHCV infection might give rise to the development of cirrhosis, and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species \u03C66 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between \u03C66 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT\u2013\u03C66 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edge-attached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.","publish_time":"2013-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Block, Karin A; Trusiak, Adrianna; Katz, Al; Gottlieb, Paul; Alimova, Alexandra; Wei, Hui; Morales, Jorge; Rice, William J; Steiner, Jeffrey C","journal":"Microbiologyopen","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b22db40e9e78fb29f6ae2938ed8ee2d00cd46b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3937728.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24357622/; https://doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.148","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["loss of infectivity","infectivity of nonenveloped viruses","reduced infectivity","infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses","MMT platelet layers","virus envelope","platelet edges","studies of nonenveloped viruses","MMT-mediated sequestration","disassembly result","Prior studies of clay","\u03C66 mixtures","total envelope loss","discernible disassembly","envelope removal","viral stability","NCs","distortion","virions","virus interactions","enveloped pathogens","viral envelopes","bacteriophage Cystoviridae species \u03C66","virion surface","surface charge distribution","study","mechanism","soils","clays","contact area","primary component of bentonite","good model","contrast","structures","sediments","heteroaggregation","components","montmorillonite","contradictory results","detergent","analyses","transmission electron microscopy","nucleocapsid"],"language":"en"},

Examining risk factors for prolonged viral shedding may provide critical insight for the development of novel therapeutics and help inform infection prevention practices. Our objective was to identify risk factors for prolonged shedding of HRV post-HCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected weekly nasal samples from allogeneic HCT recipients from day 0 to day 100 post-transplant, and performed realtime RT-PCR (12/2005 to 2/2010). Subjects with symptomatic HRV infection and a negative test within 2 weeks of the last positive were included. Duration of shedding was defined as time between the first positive and first negative samples. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were used as a proxy for viral load. HRV species were identified by sequencing the 5\u2019 non-coding region. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with prolonged shedding (\u226521 days). RESULTS: We identified 38 HCT recipients with HRV infection fulfilling study criteria (32 adults, 6 children). Median duration of shedding was 9.5 days (2-89 days); 18 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 26 samples sequenced, 69% were species A, and species B and C accounted for 15% each; the median shedding duration of HRV did not differ between species (P = 0.17). Bivariable logistic regression analyses suggest that initial high viral load (low Ct value) is associated with prolonged shedding. CONCLUSIONS: HCT recipients with initial high viral loads are at risk for prolonged HRV viral shedding.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogimi, Chikara; Xie, Hu; Leisenring, Wendy M; Kuypers, Jane M; Jerome, Keith R; Campbell, Angela P.; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael; Waghmare, Alpana","journal":"Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08efabee83adb2e2b2431c511d7502382811eeee.json; document_parses/pdf_json/03be1b13bb27c345596bc823c25963ebeb990640.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6239940.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879118303938; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.07.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879118303938; http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083879118303938/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30009982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prolonged HRV viral shedding","prolonged viral shedding","prolonged shedding of HRV post-HCT","HRV species","median shedding duration of HRV","Median duration of shedding","symptomatic HRV infection","allogeneic HCT recipients","risk factors","days","initial high viral loads","negative samples","species B","infection prevention practices","post-transplant","positive","lower respiratory tract infection","Bivariable logistic regression analyses","weekly nasal samples","negative test","hematopoietic cell transplant","low Ct value","mortality","development of novel therapeutics","critical insight","help","study criteria","Recent data","human rhinovirus","INTRODUCTION","values","adults","CONCLUSIONS","realtime RT-PCR","METHODS","Cycle threshold","weeks","proxy","Subjects","patients","non-coding region","children","objective","RESULTS","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence, driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. The emerging discipline of conservation medicine addresses these concerns through the following entities: humans; global climate; habitat destruction and alteration; biodiversity, including wildlife populations; domestic animals; and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. Furthermore, conservation medicine focuses on explicit linkages between these entities. As a crisis discipline, the usefulness of conservation medicine ultimately will depend on its applicability to solving problems. The perspectives and scientific findings of conservation medicine provide input into biomedical education; and policy and management of ecosystems, habitats and imperiled species. A sentinel species is one that has presented itself, or has been selected, to provide insight into the state (health) of an ecosystem, based on user-defined (e.g., researchers, conservationists or policymakers) objectives (e.g., disease, parasites, toxics, climate change, habitat destruction), coupled with the utility and vulnerability of this species to the perceived stress. The scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders and decision-makers to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities; the \u0022utility\u0022 of the species selected should consider its value and relevance to conservationists and to society at large (e.g., education and outreach; social sciences). Wild canids may serve as excellent sentinel species of emerging canine vector-borne diseases. Several canine vector-borne diseases or antibodies to these pathogens have been identified in wild canids including visceral leishmaniosis, Lyme disease, heartworm, hepatozoonosis and anaplasmosis to name a few. These reports are relatively recent as they relate to wildlife-domestic animal interactions, globalisation, translocations, habitat fragmentation and climate change. These pathogens and their relationship to wild canids are described herein.

It has been shown that AKAV induces apoptosis in mammalian cells. It is necessary to understand the signaling pathways involved in AKAV-induced apoptosis to further elucidate the molecular virology of AKAV. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are mediators of apoptosis; therefore, we investigated the roles of JNK and p38 MAPK cascades in AKAV-infected cells. We found that JNK and p38 MAPK as well as their downstream substrates, c-Jun and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), were phosphorylated in response to AKAV infection. A JNK inhibitor (SP600125) inhibited AKAV-mediated apoptosis whereas a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did not. We conclude that AKAV infection activates the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and the JNK cascade plays a crucial role in AKAV-induced apoptosis in vitro.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitomo, S.; Omatsu, T.; Tsuchiaka, S.; Nagai, M.; Furuya, T.; Mizutani, T.","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e51d91074212ae3b7facd94bdb48c6f21bc0655.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111864.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528816301138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473988/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2016.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528816301138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKAV","JNK"],"locations":["Simbu"],"keyphrases":["AKAV infection","AKAV-induced apoptosis","AKAV-mediated apoptosis","p38 MAPK inhibitor","JNK inhibitor","AKAV-infected cells","p38 MAPK cascades","molecular virology of AKAV","JNK cascade","roles of JNK","mediators of apoptosis","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","pathways","mammalian cells","N-terminal kinase","heat shock protein","crucial role","genus Orthobunyavirus","SP600125","HSP27","Simbu serogroup","downstream substrates","family Bunyaviridae","Abstract Akabane virus","response","SB203580"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to identify the subtypes of PCV2 that are associated with reproductive failure in pigs from the State of S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil and to investigate co-infections with other infectious organisms. FINDINGS: Samples of 168 aborted foetuses or mummified foetuses from five farrow-to-finish swine farms known to be infected with PCV2 and located in the State of S\u00E3o Paulo were tested for PCV2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were additionally tested for porcine parvovirus (PPV), Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. by PCR. PCV2 was detected in 18 of the samples (10.7%). PPV, Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp were found in 2, 10 and 0 cases, respectively. Eleven PCV2 strains were sequenced and determined to be either genotype 2a (n = 1) or 2b (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the frequency of PCV2 infections in aborted porcine foetuses from the State of S\u00E3o Paulo is rather low (10.7%) and that co-infection with other pathogens is common and may be involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure.

Many will attempt to minimize contacts with other individuals in order to protect themselves from infection and possibly death. This process is called social distancing. Social distancing strategies include restricting socializing and travel, and using barrier protections. We use modeling to show that for short-term outbreaks, social distancing can have a large influence on reducing outbreak morbidity and mortality. In particular, public health agencies working together with the media can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak by providing timely accounts of new infections and deaths. Our models show that the most effective strategy to reduce infections is to provide this information as early as possible, though providing it well into the course of the outbreak can still have a significant effect. However, our models for long-term outbreaks indicate that reporting historic infection data can result in more infections than with no reporting at all. We examine three types of media influence and we illustrate the media influence with a simulated outbreak of a generic emerging infectious disease in a small city. Social distancing can never be complete; however, for a spectrum of outbreaks, we show that leaving isolation (stopping applying social distancing measures) for up to 4 hours each day has modest effect on the overall morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mummert, Anna; Weiss, Howard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ce462cb0807906c475d4b600afac950c7e8c4e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3753329.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990974/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071692","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak morbidity","Social distancing strategies","social distancing measures","simulated outbreak","mortality","types of media influence","long-term outbreaks","short-term outbreaks","media reports","spectrum of outbreaks","outbreaks of infectious diseases","high morbidity","overall morbidity","large influence","individuals","models","reporting","timely accounts of new infections","modest effect","significant effect","historic infection data","generic emerging infectious disease","travel","restricting socializing","small city","hours","day","deaths","isolation","public health agencies","order","effective strategy","severity","barrier protections","contacts","information","modeling","process","course"],"language":"en"},

Here, we use transfection of plasmid constructs encoding full-length versions of the three transmembrane-containing nonstructural proteins (nsps) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to examine the ability of each to induce double-membrane vesicles in tissue culture. nsp3 has membrane disordering and proliferation ability, both in its full-length form and in a C-terminal-truncated form. nsp3 and nsp4 working together have the ability to pair membranes. nsp6 has membrane proliferation ability as well, inducing perinuclear vesicles localized around the microtubule organizing center. Together, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 have the ability to induce double-membrane vesicles that are similar to those observed in SARS coronavirus-infected cells. This activity appears to require the full-length form of nsp3 for action, as double-membrane vesicles were not seen in cells coexpressing the C-terminal truncation nsp3 with nsp4 and nsp6.","publish_time":"2013-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angelini, Megan M.; Akhlaghpour, Marzieh; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8682e080613d625a9f6955e5eb0fe80bbbaefda9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3747587.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00524-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["double-membrane vesicles","membrane proliferation ability","membrane disordering","full-length form of nsp3","formation of double","perinuclear vesicles","nsp6","nsp4","C-terminal truncation nsp3","SARS coronavirus-infected cells","full-length versions","viral proteins","truncated form","Coronaviruses","nonstructural proteins","viral genome replication","host cell membranes","nsps","severe acute respiratory syndrome","action","positive-stranded RNA viruses","transcription machinery","transfection of plasmid constructs","tissue culture","microtubule","CoV","mechanism","center","activity"],"language":"en"},

This review focuses on CD9 expression by hematopoietic cells and its role in modulating cellular processes involved in the regulation of inflammation. CD9 is functionally very important in many diseases and is involved either in the regulation or in the mediation of the disease. The role of CD9 in various diseases, such as viral and bacterial infections, cancer and chronic lung allograft dysfunction, is discussed. This review focuses also on its interest as a biomarker in diseases. Indeed CD9 is primarily known as a specific exosome marker however, its expression is now recognized as an anti-inflammatory marker of monocytes and macrophages. It was also described as a marker of murine IL-10-competent Breg cells and IL-10-secreting CD9(\u002B) B cells were associated with better allograft outcome in lung transplant patients, and identified as a new predictive biomarker of long-term survival. In the field of cancer, CD9 was both identified as a favorable prognostic marker or as a predictor of metastatic potential depending on cancer types. Finally, this review discusses strategies to target CD9 as a therapeutic tool. Because CD9 can have opposite effects depending on the situation, the environment and the pathology, modulating CD9 expression or blocking its effects seem to be a new promising therapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brosseau, Carole; Colas, Luc; Magnan, Antoine; Brouard, Sophie","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3aae9e36468d7e3e26825d23997b612d7ce755b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6189363.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30356731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of CD9","secreting CD9","modulating CD9 expression","review","marker of murine IL","hematopoietic cells","B cells","cancer types","field of cancer","anti-inflammatory marker of monocytes","favorable prognostic marker","specific exosome marker","various diseases","competent Breg cells","chronic lung allograft dysfunction","cell adhesion","cell type","new promising therapeutic strategy","associated molecules","opposite effects","therapeutic tool","regulation of inflammation","new predictive biomarker of long-term survival","better allograft outcome","lung transplant patients","modulating cellular processes","differentiation","growth","metastasis","motility","wide variety of biological activities","bacterial infections","signal transduction","sperm","predictor of metastatic potential","pathology","situation","environment","egg fusion","macrophages","strategies","mediation","tetraspanin superfamily"],"language":"en"},

Evaluation of this situation requires an understanding of the common etiologies, which are associated with the demographics of travelers and the destinations. Methods We conducted a 5-year prospective observational study on the etiologies of fever in travelers returning from the tropics admitted to the infectious and tropical diseases unit of a university teaching hospital in Marseilles, France. Results A total of 613 patients were enrolled, including 364 migrants (59.4%), 126 travelers (20.6%), 37 visitors (6%), 24 expatriates (3.9%), and 62 patients (10.1%) who could not be classified. Malaria was the most common diagnosis (75.2%), with most cases (62%) acquired by migrants from the Comoros archipelago and who had traveled to these islands to visit friends and relatives. Agents of food-borne and water-borne infections (3.9%) and respiratory tract infections (3.4%) were also frequently identified as the cause of fever. Other infections included emerging diseases such as gnathostomiasis, hepatitis E infection and rickettsial diseases, as well as common infections or exotic diseases. Conclusions Although we have identified here various causes of imported fever, 8.2% of the fevers remained unexplained. An improved approach to diagnosis may allow for the discovery of new diseases in travelers in the future.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parola, Philippe; Soula, Georges; Gazin, Pierre; Foucault, Cedric; Delmont, Jean; Brouqui, Philippe","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a98cb8d707c25c75ab93abc33960cf417f03281.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106190.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893905000086; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893905000086","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","Comoros"],"keyphrases":["rickettsial diseases","emerging diseases","exotic diseases","common infections","tropical diseases unit","demographics of travelers","patients","discovery of new diseases","etiologies of fever","common etiologies","common diagnosis","Summary Background Febrile travelers","cause of fever","respiratory tract infections","migrants","various causes of imported fever","gnathostomiasis","university teaching hospital","hepatitis E infection","diagnostic challenge","year prospective observational study","Marseilles","France","understanding","tropics","Western physicians","situation","water","future","islands","friends","relatives","Agents of food","Evaluation","Comoros archipelago","improved approach","fevers","total","assessment","destinations","Malaria","Conclusions","Methods","visitors","expatriates","cases"],"language":"en"},

Three virological laboratories also participated in the study. The study was planned for 5 weeks from January 25, 2010 to February 27, 2010. A subset of 150 Sentinel GPs, located in mainland France, was enrolled to collect clinical data and nasopharyngeal samples from every first patient of the week having a medical visit for influenza\u2010like illness defined as a sudden fever of 39\u00B0C or more with respiratory symptoms and myalgia. Sixty\u2010three GPs (42%) collected 103 samples while 87 GPs (58%) did not. GPs did not differ with respect to their age, gender, urban/rural distribution, or years of inscription in the Sentinel Network. Patients included were of a similar age and had similar vaccination characteristics, but were more frequently men than influenza\u2010like illness patients reported to the network during the study period.

Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage r\u00E9gimes. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies.

Fully understanding the different awareness, attitudes and protective behaviors adopted by workers in live-poultry markets (LPMWs) and local community residents (CRs) to face the challenges of LPAI and HPAI is very important to minimize viral adaptations to human populations. METHODS: A structural questionnaire containing information on respondents\u2019 occupation, personal risk awareness, attitudes toward different policies, and preventative measures was administered. The two-stage survey (before and after HPAI H5N2 outbreaks) was conducted from 2007 to 2012, including: (1) 430 LPMWs and 418 CRs at LPMs from different geographical areas of Taiwan after the government announced outbreaks of LPAI H5N2 during 2007\u20132009, and (2) 73 LPMWs and 152 CRs at two LPMs in central Taiwan after the HPAI H5N2 outbreaks in 2012. The chi-squared test and logistic regression were applied for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. RESULTS: Before HPAI-H5N2 outbreaks, higher educated respondents demonstrated greater risk awareness and concerns regarding AI. However, LPM-workers protected themselves less from AI viruses (AIVs) and had lower acceptance of human or avian influenza vaccines. Most importantly, the participants who opposed (versus agreed with) the policy on banning live-poultry slaughtering at LPMs reported lower awareness of government prevention and control policies [Odds Ratio (OR): 0.76, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 0.56\u20131.01] or practiced preventive measures (OR: 0.42, 95 % CI: 0.25\u20130.70). After HPAI-H5N2 outbreaks, the risk awareness about AI in central Taiwan significantly increased [LPAI to HPAI LPMWs: 34.6 to 65.6 %, p \u003C 0.05; CRs: 44.0 to 76.5 %, p \u003C 0.05] and LPMWs\u2019 belief in the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent human or avian influenza virus infection strikingly decreased (92.3 to 68.5 %, p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Risk awareness depends on high or low pathogenicity of AIVs, working in LPMs, levels of education, age, and proximity to the sites of severe AI outbreaks. Regardless of novel LPAI or HPAI virus reassortants that pose public health risks, prompt and clear risk communication focusing on both correct information about AIVs and the most appropriate preventive measures are important for effective prevention of human infection.

Using a replicating modified vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain (MVTT) as a vaccine vector, we constructed MVTT(HA-QH) and MVTT(HA-AH), which expresses the H5 gene of a goose-derived Qinghai strain A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived Anhui Strain A/Anhui/1/2005. The immunogenicity profiles of both vaccine candidates were evaluated. Vaccination with MVTT(HA-QH) induced a significant level of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) against a homologous strain and a wide range of H5N1 pseudoviruses (clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.4). Neutralization tests (NT) and Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies inhibit the live autologous virus as well as a homologous A/Xingjiang/1/2006 and a heterologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004, representing two human isolates from clade 2.2 and clade 1, respectively. Importantly, mice vaccinated with intranasal MVTT(HA-QH) were completely protected from challenge with lethal dosages of A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 and the A/Viet Nam/1194/2004, respectively, but not control mice that received a mock MVTT(S) vaccine. However, MVTT(HA-AH) induced much lower levels of NT against its autologous strain. Our results suggest that it is feasible to use the H5 gene from A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 to construct an effective vaccine, when using MVTT as a vector, to prevent infections against homologous and genetically divergent human H5N1 influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2013-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Haixia; Liu, Li; Zhu, Qingyu; Tan, Zhiwu; Yu, Wenbo; Tang, Xian; Zhan, Dawei; Du, Yanhua; Wang, Haibo; Liu, Di; Li, Zhixin; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Ho, David D.; Gao, George F.; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9bcd70bf18a413b1af105124cc232f2fe0fd5b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3866202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24358269/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083274","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tian Tan"],"organizations":["Anhui Strain A/Anhui"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homologous strain","mock MVTT","intranasal MVTT","HA-QH","goose-derived Qinghai strain","autologous strain","HA-AH","vaccine vector","Bar-headed Goose","human-derived Anhui Strain","vaccine candidates","effective vaccine","heterologous human H5N1 influenza viruses","divergent human H5N1 influenza viruses","human isolates","zoonotic H5N1 pandemic","H5 gene","mice","wide range of H5N1 pseudoviruses","replicating modified vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain","live autologous virus","lower levels of NT","significant level of neutralizing antibodies","Haemagglutination inhibition","timely fashion","protection","clades","infections","Neutralization tests","lethal dosages","challenge","possibility","immunogenicity profiles","Vaccination","Xingjiang","Vietnam","Viet Nam","results"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, comparative genomics of SNU8067 (K-I type) and KM91 IBVs was performed, and an animal model to test the pathogenicity of SNU8067 was established and applied to vaccine efficacy test. The genome sizes of SNU8067 (27,708 nt) and KM91 (27,626 nt) were slightly different and the nucleotide and amino acid identities of the S1 (79%, 77%), 3a (65%, 52%), and 3b (81%, 72%) genes were lower than those of other genes (94%\u201397%, 92%\u201398%). A recombination analysis revealed that SNU8067 was a recombinant virus with a KM91-like backbone except S1, 3a, and 3b genes which might be from an unknown virus. An SNU8067 infection inhibited formation of hierarchal ovarian follicles (80%) and oviduct maturation (50%) in the control group, whereas 70% of vaccinated chickens were protected from lesions.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Seung-Min; Kwon, Hyuk-Joon; Kim, Il-Hwan; Mo, Mei-Lan; Kim, Jae-Hong","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c44fe859327f5e7b02cc27a10a228ae5288d65b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3509667.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v4112670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["K-I"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["pathogenicity of SNU8067","SNU8067 infection","KM91 IBVs","b genes","comparative genomics of SNU8067","genome sizes of SNU8067","pathogenicity of Korean IBVs","recombinant virus","unknown virus","S1","genomic analyses of Korean IBV strains","vaccine efficacy test","animal models","genotypes of infectious bronchitis virus","commercial inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines","formation of hierarchal ovarian follicles","amino acid identities","reproductive organs","nucleotide","present study","date","backbone","vaccinated chickens","recombination analysis","lesions","nephropathogenic","Massachusetts","control group","oviduct maturation","field"],"language":"en"},

Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3\u201385) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a non-statistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function test including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased. The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse. IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality.

Some viruses may also survive by transforming the infected cell into an immortal tumour cell.

Viruses encode miRNAs that regulate expression of both cellular and viral genes, and contribute to the pathogenic properties of viruses. Hence, neutralizing the action of viral miRNAs expression by complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides or so-called anti-miRNAs may represent a strategy to combat viral infections and viral-induced pathogenesis. This review describes the miRNAs encoded by human viruses, and discusses the possible therapeutic applications of anti-miRNAs against viral diseases.","publish_time":"2009-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moens, Ugo","journal":"J Biomed Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fea38758661f89b35ac1bba4b6f78d58994d5bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2688686.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2009/419539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["action of viral miRNAs expression","viral particle","viral infections","viral genes","viral diseases","human viruses","so-called anti-miRNAs","viral-induced pathogenesis","pathogenic properties of viruses","possible therapeutic applications of anti-miRNAs","posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression","host cells","infected cell","host immune system","immortal tumour cell","complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides","virus invisible","entities","strategy","hiding places","small non-coding transcripts","existence","MicroRNAs","intracellular parasites","review"],"language":"en"},

It was also confirmed previously that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) can bind to PEDV, and anti-pAPN antibodies may inhibit the combination. To investigate whether pAPN is a receptor for PEDV, we transfected MDCK cells with porcine aminopeptidase (pAPN) cDNA and this enabled non-susceptible cells to support PEDV replication and serial viral propagation. Moreover, the infection was blocked by antibodies against pAPN, implies the critical role of pAPN during virus entry. In addition, immunofluorescence assays for detection of pAPN and PEDV antigens, together with neutralization assays using antibodies against pAPN, further confirmed the correlation between pAPN expression and viral replication in pAPN-transfected MDCK cells.

Notably, recent studies suggest that DDX3 is a component of anti-viral innate immune signaling pathways. Indeed, DDX3 contributes to enhance the induction of anti-viral mediators, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 and type I IFN. However, DDX3 seems to be an important target for several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and poxvirus.

We previously reported increased bronchial mucosa eosinophil and neutrophil inflammation in COPD experiencing naturally occurring exacerbations. But it is unclear whether virus per se induces bronchial mucosal inflammation, nor whether this relates to exacerbation severity. Objectives To determine the extent and nature of bronchial mucosal inflammation following experimental rhinovirus (RV)-16-induced COPD exacerbations and its relationship to disease severity. Methods Bronchial mucosal inflammatory cell phenotypes were determined at pre-infection baseline and following experimental RV infection in 17 GOLD stage II COPD subjects and as controls, 20 smokers and 11 non-smokers, with normal lung function. No subject had a history of asthma/allergic rhinitis: all were negative for aero-allergen skin prick tests. Results RV-infection increased the numbers of bronchial mucosal eosinophils and neutrophils only in COPD and CD8\u002B T-lymphocytes in COPD and non-smokers. Monocytes/macrophages, CD4\u002B T- and CD20\u002B B-lymphocytes were increased in all subjects. At baseline, compared to non-smokers, COPD subjects and smokers had increased numbers of bronchial mucosal monocytes/macrophages and CD8\u002B T-lymphocytes but fewer numbers of CD4\u002B T- and CD20\u002B B-lymphocytes. The virus-induced inflammatory cells in COPD were positively associated with virus load, illness severity and reductions in lung function. Conclusion Experimental rhinovirus infection induces bronchial mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia only in COPD and monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in both COPD and control subjects. The virus-induced inflammatory cell phenotypes observed in COPD positively related to virus load, illness severity. Anti-viral/anti-inflammatory therapies could attenuate bronchial inflammation and ameliorate virus-induced COPD exacerbations.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jie; Mallia, Patrick; Footitt, Joseph; Qiu, Yusheng; Message, Simon D.; Kebadze, Tatiana; Aniscenko, Julia.; Barnes, Peter.J.; Adcock, Ian M.; Kon, Onn M.; Johnson, Malcolm; Contoli, Marco; Stanciu, Luminita A.; Papi, Alberto; Jeffery, Peter K.; Johnston, Sebastian L.","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9371a394c51f936cba04f0661a9f0b02e4c2a911.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283204/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920304279?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.03.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920304279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD subjects","virus-induced COPD exacerbations","bronchial inflammation","bronchial mucosal eosinophilia","numbers of bronchial mucosal monocytes","nature of bronchial mucosal inflammation","numbers of bronchial mucosal eosinophils","virus load","experimental RV infection","Methods Bronchial mucosal inflammatory cell phenotypes","T-lymphocytes","increased bronchial mucosa eosinophil","Results RV-infection","macrophages","disease severity","non-smokers","illness severity","Conclusion Experimental rhinovirus infection","pre-infection baseline","neutrophil inflammation","control subjects","exacerbation severity","Abstract Background Respiratory viral infection","CD8","fewer numbers of CD4","inflammatory cells","CD20","B-lymphocytes","normal lung function","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","GOLD stage","reductions","neutrophils","neutrophilia","anti-inflammatory therapies","extent","controls","relationship","aero-allergen skin prick tests","history of asthma","allergic rhinitis","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: An Individual Space-Time Activity-based Model (ISTAM) was applied to simulate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control measures including: (1) refraining from social activities, (2) school closure and (3) household quarantine, for a hypothetical influenza outbreak in an urban area. RESULTS: Amongst the set of control measures tested, refraining from social activities with various compliance levels was relatively ineffective. Household quarantine was very effective, especially for the peak number of cases and total number of cases, with large differences between compliance levels. Household quarantine resulted in a decrease in the peak number of cases from more than 300 to around 158 for a 100% compliance level, a decrease of about 48.7%. The delay in the outbreak peak was about 3 to 17 days. The total number of cases decreased to a range of 3635-5403, that is, 63.7%-94.7% of the baseline value. When coupling control measures, household quarantine together with school closure was the most effective strategy. The resulting space-time distribution of infection in different classes of activity bundles (AB) suggests that the epidemic outbreak is strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. By sensitivity analysis, this study demonstrated that earlier implementation of control measures leads to greater efficacy. Also, for infectious diseases with larger basic reproduction number, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Simulated results showed that household quarantine was the most effective control measure, while school closure and household quarantine implemented together achieved the greatest benefit. Agent-based models should be applied in the future to evaluate the efficacy of control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a range of settings given sufficient information about the given case and knowledge about the transmission processes at a fine scale.","publish_time":"2011-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yong; Atkinson, Peter M; Ettema, Dick","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06589343cb2fcc62a39c587071c8a9e76836f993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3151229.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21767379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Household"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["household quarantine","efficacy of control measures","set of control measures","peak number of cases","total number of cases","effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control measures","earlier implementation of control measures","effective control measure","school closure","effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures","outbreak peak","Individual Space-Time Activity-based Model","larger basic reproduction number","transmission of infectious disease","range of settings","range of disease outbreaks","space-time details","various compliance levels","social activities","effective strategy","decrease","epidemic outbreak","Agent-based models","hypothetical influenza outbreak","transmission processes","resulting space-time distribution of infection","infectious diseases","given case","greater efficacy","Simulated results","different classes of activity bundles","AB","human population","sufficient information","large differences","knowledge","study","complex process","urban area","ISTAM","fine scale","children","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","future","sensitivity analysis","greatest benefit","reality","delay","baseline value","adults","days"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we report that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protected against severe lung injury induced by RSV infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency aggravated RSV-associated disease pathogenesis, mainly by its action on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Furthermore, administration of a recombinant ACE2 protein alleviated the severity of RSV-induced lung injury. These findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in preventing RSV-induced lung injury, and suggest that ACE2 is a promising potential therapeutic target in the management of RSV-induced lung disease.","publish_time":"2016-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Hongjing; Xie, Zhengde; Li, Tieling; Zhang, Shaogeng; Lai, Chengcai; Zhu, Ping; Wang, Keyu; Han, Lina; Duan, Yueqiang; Zhao, Zhongpeng; Yang, Xiaolan; Xing, Li; Zhang, Peirui; Wang, Zhouhai; Li, Ruisheng; Yu, Jane J.; Wang, Xiliang; Yang, Penghui","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4728398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26813885/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep19840","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","RSV-induced lung injury","management of RSV","severity of RSV","RSV-infected patients","induced lung disease","severe lung injury","ACE2 deficiency aggravated RSV-associated disease pathogenesis","recombinant ACE2 protein","angiotensin","viral pathogenesis","pediatric patients","major cause of severe lower respiratory illness","Respiratory syncytial virus","young children","infants","experimental mouse model","underlying mechanisms responsible","promising potential therapeutic target","critical role","clinical outcomes","type","action","vaccines","receptor","AT1R","administration","date","drugs","findings","enzyme","paper"],"language":"en"},

Understanding how host ranges are determined is very important for public health, as well as wildlife, plant, livestock and agricultural diseases. Our current understanding of host\u2013parasite associations hinges on co-evolution, which assumes evolved host preferences (host specialization) of the parasite. Despite the explanatory power of this framework, we have only a vague understanding of why many parasites routinely cross the host species\u2019 barrier. Here we introduce a simple model demonstrating how superinfection (in a heterogeneous community) can promote host\u2013parasite association. Strikingly, the model illustrates that strong host\u2013parasite association occurs in the absence of host specialization, while still permitting cross-species transmission. For decades, host specialization has been foundational in explaining the maintenance of distinct parasites/strains in host species. We argue that host specializations may be exaggerated, and can occur as a byproduct (not necessarily the cause) of host\u2013parasite associations.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haven, James; Park, Andrew William","journal":"Theoretical Population Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c5c716e6eab906fb73e4f0fb858602a0ce9e1cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24161558/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040580913001068; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580913001068; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2013.09.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strong host","host ranges","host specializations","absence of host specialization","current understanding of host","narrow host range","wide host range","evolved host preferences","host species\u2019 barrier","parasite associations hinges","Abstract Parasites","vague understanding","maintenance of distinct parasites","cross-species transmission","simple model","co-evolution","wildlife","strains","plant","livestock","superinfection","cause","agricultural diseases","heterogeneous community","framework","public health","decades","explanatory power","byproduct"],"language":"en"},

Further, although vaccination can prevent disease, vaccine development is impeded by several factors. Therefore, novel approaches to treat and manage respiratory infections are urgently needed. Passive immunization represents a possible alternative to meet this need. Immunoglobulin Y antibodies (IgYs) from the yolk of chicken eggs have previously been used against bacterial and viral infections in human and animals. Their advantages include lack of reaction with mammalian Fc receptors, low production cost, and ease of extraction. Compared to mammalian IgGs, they have higher target specificity and greater binding avidity. They also possess remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity in the respiratory tract and lungs. In this review, we provide an overview of avian IgYs and describe their potential therapeutic applications for the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbas, Aymn Talat; El-Kafrawy, Sherif Aly; Sohrab, Sayed Sartaj; Azhar, Esam Ibraheem Ahmed","journal":"Hum Vaccin Immunother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc1f4b62e7c63ec2a3536401ce6aea880dca8512.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6363154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230944/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2018.1514224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract infections","treatment of respiratory infections","viral infections","mammalian Fc receptors","overview of avian IgYs","critical challenge","low production cost","causative organisms","prevention","higher target specificity","lack of reaction","potential therapeutic applications","greater binding avidity","activity","global health care community","possible alternative","vaccine development","Emergence of drug resistance","human","ease of extraction","yolk of chicken eggs","Immunoglobulin Y antibodies","Passive immunization","vaccination","disease","advantages","animals","lungs","remarkable pathogen","novel approaches","factors","need","review"],"language":"en"},

This study was aimed at identifying seasonal trends and epidemiologic features of pediatric HSP patients through public data to analyze the correlation of HSP and prevalence of a specific respiratory or enteric virus. We extracted information on pediatric HSP patients categorized into 4 age groups and data on 8 respiratory and 4 enteric viruses were extracted from national data. We used the decomposition of time series analysis and correlation analysis to identify the incidence of HSP and the prevalence of each virus. From 2013 to 2016, 16,940 patients under the age of 18 were diagnosed with HSP in Korea, 6203 (36.6%) were diagnosed with HSP in middle childhood. Spring had the largest number of patients (5252, 31.0%), and summer had the smallest number of patients (3224, 19.0%). The largest and smallest number of cases occurred in March (1949, 11.5%) and August (959, 5.7%), respectively. However, among the adolescents, more patients were diagnosed in the summer (985, 24.8%) than in the fall (760, 19.1%). The positive detection counts of most viruses showed apparent seasonal variations. Depending on the age group, the epidemic patterns of influenza and rotaviruses were temporally and statistically similar to that of HSP. We have confirmed that the occurrence of pediatric HSP in Korea shows a seasonal tendency, which is age-dependent and related to exposure to infectious agents and suggest some respiratory or enteric viruses may play an important role in pathophysiology.","publish_time":"2018-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Hyun Ho; Lim, In Seok; Choi, Byung-Sun; Yi, Dae Yong","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b992705cb74945a376dfbcf616b8c213b0d6678.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6133644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200139/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000012217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSP"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["correlation of HSP","incidence of HSP","occurrence of pediatric HSP","epidemiologic features of pediatric HSP patients","largest number of patients","smallest number of patients","enteric viruses","age groups","age-dependent","correlation analysis","seasonal trends","public data","seasonal tendency","prevalence","national data","smallest number of cases","Korea","summer","apparent seasonal variations","decomposition of time series analysis","epidemic patterns of influenza","rotaviruses","exposure","infectious agents","important role","Henoch","Sch\u00F6nlein purpura","Spring","information","positive detection","common vasculitis","children","pathophysiology","study","middle childhood","adolescents","fall"],"language":"en"},

The data arise from a prospective study of 47 households (493 individuals) in rural Kenya, followed through a 6-month period of an RSV seasonal outbreak. Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice each week from all household members, irrespective of symptoms, and tested for RSV by multiplex PCR. The RSV G gene was sequenced. A total of 205 RSV infection episodes were detected in 179 individuals from 40 different households. The infection data were interval censored and assuming a random event time between observations, the average duration of virus shedding was 11\u00B72 (95% confidence interval 10\u00B71\u201312\u00B73) days.

Pairwise nucleotide comparison and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Japanese BToVs shared high identity with each other and showed high similarities with BToV Breda1 strain in S, M, and HE coding regions. Japanese BToVs showed high similarities with porcine toroviruses in ORF1a, ORF1b, and N coding regions and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions, suggestive of a natural recombination event.

In addition, diphyllin delivered by polymeric nanoparticles consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) further demonstrates an improved safety profile and enhanced inhibitory activity against FIPV. In an in vitro model of antibody-dependent enhancement of FIPV infection, diphyllin nanoparticles showed a prominent antiviral effect against the feline coronavirus. In addition, the diphyllin nanoparticles were well tolerated in mice following high-dose intravenous administration. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of diphyllin and its nanoformulation for the treatment of FIP.","publish_time":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Che-Ming Jack; Chang, Wei-Shan; Fang, Zih-Syun; Chen, You-Ting; Wang, Wen-Lin; Tsai, Hsiao-Han; Chueh, Ling-Ling; Takano, Tomomi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Chen, Hui-Wen","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/467ab436fea0423f0621af047cd6e5c6dae5260e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5638965.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-13316-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29026122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diphyllin nanoparticles","diphyllin dose","mutated feline coronavirus","feline infectious peritonitis virus","therapeutic potential of diphyllin","pathogenic mechanism of feline coronavirus","polymeric nanoparticles","endosomal acidification","antiviral activity","nanoformulation","addition","dependent enhancement of FIPV infection","block-poly","inhibitory activity","treatment of FIP","prominent antiviral effect","downstream virus replication","high-dose intravenous administration","cytoplasmic entry","novel vacuolar ATPase blocker","mice","type","ethylene glycol","lactide-co-glycolide","improved safety profile","cells","PEG-PLGA","fatal viral diseases","cats","model of antibody","cellular susceptibility","fcwf","light","study","Experimental results","effective vaccine available"],"language":"en"},

Shrimp are displaced from their natural environments, provided artificial or alternative feeds, stocked in high density, exposed to stress through changes in water quality and are transported nationally and internationally, either live or as frozen product. These practices have provided opportunities for increased pathogenicity of existing infections, exposure to new pathogens, and the rapid transmission and transboundary spread of disease. Not surprisingly, a succession of new viral diseases has devastated the production and livelihoods of farmers and their sustaining communities. This review examines the major viral pathogens of farmed shrimp, the likely reasons for their emergence and spread, and the consequences for the structure and operation of the shrimp farming industry.

Due to their roles as linchpins in trafficking and signaling pathways, PDZ domains are attractive targets: both for controlling viral pathogens, which bind PDZ domains and hijack cellular machinery, as well as for developing therapies to combat human disease. However, successful therapeutic interventions that avoid off-target effects are a challenge, because each PDZ domain interacts with a number of cellular targets, and specific binding preferences can be difficult to decipher. Over twenty-five years of research has produced a wealth of data on the stereochemical preferences of individual PDZ proteins and their binding partners. Currently the field lacks a central repository for this information. Here, we provide this important resource and provide a manually curated, comprehensive list of the 271 human PDZ domains.

When the outbreak of this apparently novel infectious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) came to an end in July 2003, it had caused over 8000 probable cases worldwide and more than 700 deaths. Starting in March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) organised an unprecedented international effort by leading laboratories working together to find the causative agent. Little more than one week later, three research groups from this WHO-coordinated network simultaneously found evidence of a hitherto unknown coronavirus in SARS patients, using different approaches. After Koch\u2019s postulates had been fulfilled, WHO officially declared on 16 April 2003 that this virus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS. Ever since, progress around SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been swift. Within weeks of the first isolate being obtained, its complete genome was sequenced. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of SARS-CoV RNA were developed and made available freely and widely; nevertheless the SARS case definition still remains based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. The agent\u2019s environmental stability, methods suitable for inactivation and disinfection, and potential antiviral compounds have been studied, and development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics is ongoing. Despite its grave consequences in humanitarian, political and economic terms, SARS may serve as an example of how much can be achieved through a well-coordinated international approach, combining the latest technological advances of molecular virology with more \u201Ctraditional\u201D techniques carried out to an excellent standard.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger, A.; Drosten, Ch.; Doerr, H.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 [9]. Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the \u201Centry receptor\u201D for the infection process involving membrane fusion [10]. A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the \u201Ctime delay\u201D given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the \u201Cexposure time\u201D to the \u201Cinteraction time\u201D (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. Background The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the \u03B2-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. Methods A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. Results A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. Conclusions From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sohail, Ayesha; Nutini, Alessandro","journal":"Prog Biophys Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6df77a425d4ca4091e6c013444aa65c032a60e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360608/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610720300262?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610720300262","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","MCMC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["virus interaction","virus-cells","RNA virus","SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds","new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic","aid of Hill function","interaction time","time delay","control strategies","viral infection process","mathematical model","dynamics of target cells","aid of numerical solvers","aid of numerical computations","protein S","infected cells","related vaccine","related disease","delay differential equation model","role of Hill function formalism","control strategy","\u03B2-coronavirus genus","B0AT1 protein","complex dynamics","exposure time","incubation period","creation of new antiviral therapies","reverse engineering process","ACE2 receptor","principles of cell","entry receptor","logical evaluation of viral density","theoretical framework","computational framework","amino acid sequence of S proein","future experimental studies","promising technique","formation","useful tools","expected duration","biochemical interactions","city of Wuhan","parametric values","hetero-trimer","forecasting","China","features","worldwide emergency","World Health Organization","rapid spread","ongoing threat","atypical pneumonia","causative agent","medical treatment","coefficients","membrane fusion","CoViD","functions","help of MCMC algorithm","infectious condition","inexpensive manner","molecular mechanism","important parameters","resulting thresholds","analysis","Methods","nCoV","manuscript","place","purpose","article","Conclusions","Abstract","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Because remaining controversial, the objective was to determine prospectively the respective role of RSV, RV, hMPV and co-infections on the severity of acute bronchiolitis in very young infants. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 209 infants (median age: 2.4 months) were enrolled in a prospective study of infants \u003C1 year old, hospitalized for a first episode of bronchiolitis during the winter epidemic season and with no high risk for severe disease. The severity was assessed by recording SaO(2)% at admission, a daily clinical score (scale 0\u201318), the duration of oxygen supplementation and the length of hospitalization. Viruses were identified in 94.7% by RT amplification reaction: RSV only (45.8%), RV only (7.2%), hMPV only (3.8%), dual RSV/RV (14.3%), and other virus only (2%) or coinfections (9%). RV compared respectively with RSV and dual RSV/RV infection caused a significant less severe disease with a lower clinical score (5[3.2\u20136] vs. 6[4\u20138], p = 0.01 and 5.5[5\u20137], p = 0.04), a shorter time in oxygen supplementation (0[0\u20131] days vs. 2[0\u20133] days, p = 0.02 and 2[0\u20133] days, p = 0.03) and a shorter hospital stay (3[3\u20134.7] days vs.6 [5\u20138] days, p = 0.001 and 5[4\u20136] days, p = 0.04). Conversely, RSV infants had also longer duration of hospitalization in comparison with RSV/RV (p = 0.01) and hMPV (p = 0.04). The multivariate analyses showed that the type of virus carried was independently associated with the duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This study underlined the role of RV in early respiratory diseases, as frequently carried by young infants with a first acute bronchiolitis. RSV caused the more severe disease and conversely RV the lesser severity. No additional effect of dual RSV/RV infection was observed on the severity.","publish_time":"2009-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marguet, Christophe; Lubrano, Marc; Gueudin, Marie; Le Roux, Pascal; Deschildre, Antoine; Forget, Chantal; Couderc, Laure; Siret, Daniel; Donnou, Marie-Dominique; Bubenheim, Michael; Vabret, Astrid; Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/184c8c4637d343cd81dddd0d3f5e6c922f538afe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2644758.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19240806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","RSV/RV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infants","RV infection","role of RV","days","young infants","respective role of RSV","severity of acute bronchiolitis","additional effect of dual RSV","severe disease","prospective study of infants","hMPV","episode of bronchiolitis","lesser severity","longer duration of hospitalization","duration of oxygen supplementation","early respiratory diseases","RT amplification reaction","length of hospitalization","viral co-infections","lower clinical score","daily clinical score","shorter time","shorter hospital","type of virus","various single viruses","comparison","high risk","winter epidemic season","growing involvement","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","median age","admission","months","year old","objective","scale","METHODS","BACKGROUND","multivariate analyses","SaO","CONCLUSION","coinfections"],"language":"en"},

Cells harboring a disrupted ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10) allele survived reovirus infection, and subsequently ADAM10 was shown by RNA interference to be important for replication of HIV-1. RESULTS: Silencing ADAM10 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) 48 hours before infection significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and in CD4(\u002B )cell lines. In agreement, ADAM10 over-expression significantly increased HIV-1 replication. ADAM10 down-regulation did not inhibit viral reverse transcription, indicating that viral entry and uncoating are also independent of ADAM10 expression. Integration of HIV-1 cDNA was reduced in ADAM10 down-regulated cells; however, concomitant 2-LTR circle formation was not detected, suggesting that HIV-1 does not enter the nucleus. Further, ADAM10 silencing inhibited downstream reporter gene expression and viral protein translation. Interestingly, we found that while the metalloprotease domain of ADAM10 is not required for HIV-1 replication, ADAM15 and \u03B3-secretase (which proteolytically release the extracellular and intracellular domains of ADAM10 from the plasma membrane, respectively) do support productive infection. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that ADAM10 facilitates replication at the level of nuclear trafficking. Collectively, our data support a model whereby ADAM10 is cleaved by ADAM15 and \u03B3-secretase and that the ADAM10 intracellular domain directly facilitates HIV-1 nuclear trafficking. Thus, ADAM10 represents a novel cellular target class for development of antiretroviral drugs.","publish_time":"2011-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friedrich, Brian M; Murray, James L; Li, Guangyu; Sheng, Jinsong; Hodge, Thomas W; Rubin, Donald H; O\u0027Brien, William A; Ferguson, Monique R","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb01f3bd0a1b61ef92b556330b94f59c947ea1a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3118345.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-8-32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21569301/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADAM10 silencing","disrupted ADAM10","Silencing ADAM10 expression","independent of ADAM10 expression","ADAM10 over-expression","metalloprotease domain of ADAM10","ADAM10 intracellular domain","replication of HIV","intracellular domains of ADAM10","viral infection","inhibited HIV","increased HIV","Integration of HIV","lytic infection","reovirus infection","productive infection","viral entry","downstream reporter gene expression","viral protein translation","viral reverse transcription","ADAM15","\u03B3-secretase","regulated cells","screening libraries of cells","level of nuclear trafficking","cellular genes","RNA interference","small interfering RNA","novel cellular target class","Gene trap insertional mutagenesis","primary human monocyte-derived macrophages","survival","siRNA","hours","CD4","development of antiretroviral drugs","uncoating","high-throughput approach","BACKGROUND","allele","plasma membrane","Disintegrin","regulation","agreement","RESULTS","variety of viruses","LTR circle formation","model","cDNA","cell lines","data","CONCLUSIONS","nucleus"],"language":"en"},

Identification of the 3\u2032 frameshifting stimulator in intermediate species or other invertebrates remains unresolved.","publish_time":"2004-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ivanov, Ivaylo P; Anderson, Christine B; Gesteland, Raymond F; Atkins, John F","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f79e279c25f61b780034e922c808e48b0c83b91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125782.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283604004681; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604004681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA pseudoknot","invertebrate antizyme mRNAs","expression of eukaryotic antizyme genes","frameshifting stimulator","translational frameshifting","frameshifting event","vertebrate counterparts","related invertebrates","frameshift site","structure","origin","intermediate species","wide variety of organisms","mammals","yeast","decoding","Identification"],"language":"en"},

The ideal PCR test detects all variants of the target pathogen, including newly discovered and emerging variants, while closely related pathogens and their variants should not be detected. This is challenging as pathogens show a high degree of genetic variation due to genetic drift, adaptation and evolution. Therefore, frequent re-evaluation of PCR diagnostics is needed to monitor its usefulness. Validation of PCR diagnostics recognizes three stages, in silico, in vitro and in vivo validation. In vitro and in vivo testing are usually costly, labour intensive and imply a risk of handling dangerous pathogens. In silico validation reduces this burden. In silico validation checks primers and probes by comparing their sequences with available nucleotide sequences. In recent years the amount of available sequences has dramatically increased by high throughput and deep sequencing projects. This makes in silico validation more informative, but also more computing intensive. To facilitate validation of PCR tests, a software tool named PCRv was developed. PCRv consists of a user friendly graphical user interface and coordinates the use of the software programs ClustalW and SSEARCH in order to perform in silico validation of PCR tests of different formats. Use of internal control sequences makes the analysis compliant to laboratory quality control systems. Finally, PCRv generates a validation report that includes an overview as well as a list of detailed results. In-house developed, published and OIE-recommended PCR tests were easily (re-) evaluated by use of PCRv. To demonstrate the power of PCRv, in silico validation of several PCR tests are shown and discussed.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Weezep, Erik; Kooi, Engbert A.; van Rijn, Piet A.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c5ee28376fc314e26bd3ea5f6dc7a5d356d9175.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095975/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419301247; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419301247","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Validation of PCR diagnostics","validation report","silico validation of PCR tests of different formats","Abstract PCR diagnostics","silico validation checks primers","use of PCRv","OIE-recommended PCR tests","frequent re-evaluation of PCR diagnostics","ideal PCR test","available sequences","pathogen variants","power of PCRv","emerging variants","internal control sequences","available nucleotide sequences","line of laboratory diagnostics","related pathogens","genetic drift","high degree of genetic variation","high throughput","laboratory quality control systems","software tool","labour intensive","risk of handling dangerous pathogens","target pathogen","computing intensive","user friendly graphical user interface","software programs ClustalW","analysis compliant","order","probes","SSEARCH","deep sequencing projects","adaptation","family","genus","stages","testing","evolution","overview","recent years","list of detailed results","species","burden","usefulness"],"language":"en"},

Here, we constructed expression plasmids as well as recombinant PEDV carrying myc-tagged ORF3 to assess their expression and subcellular localization in both transfected and infected cells. In PEDV-infected cells, ORF3 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, partially in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (Golgi). Interestingly, ORF3 with the N-terminal Flag tag was also detected on the cell surface concomitant with the spike (S) protein as determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. ORF3 and S proteins were also co-localized at perinuclear compartments and in the vesicle-like structures in transfected and infected cells. We also demonstrated that both full-length and naturally truncated ORF3 proteins could interact with the S protein but with different binding affinity, which correlate with the ability of the protein to regulate virus replication in cell culture. Collectively, our results underscore the unprecedented role of the ORF3, which involves the interaction of ORF3 with S and, possibly, other structural protein during PEDV replication.","publish_time":"2018-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaewborisuth, Challika; He, Qigai; Jongkaewwattana, Anan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe768cfead153c07c019ac6d722021f035738dc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6115756.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10080399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accessory protein ORF3","interaction of ORF3","PEDV replication","truncated ORF3 proteins","PEDV-infected cells","S proteins","recombinant PEDV","structural protein","virus replication","viral proteins","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","cell culture","expression plasmids","Golgi apparatus","severe watery diarrhea","cell surface concomitant","important swine pathogen responsible","spike","subcellular localization","contribution","perinuclear compartments","flow cytometry","different binding affinity","vesicle","function","N-terminal Flag tag","structures","endoplasmic reticulum","neonatal piglets","confocal microscopy","unprecedented role","cytoplasm","ability","myc","extensive studies","results"],"language":"en"},

These may prove useful for diagnosis and, possibly, in determining disease etiology.","publish_time":"2001-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Irving, Melita B; Pan, Oscar; Scott, Jamie K","journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ad06be75e9c306aa10fea704f93d4ba90623a15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129944.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367593100002088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593100002088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigen-fragment libraries","gene-fragment libraries","Abstract Random peptide libraries","native antigen","candidate antigens","protein antigens","immune disease","disease etiology","significant contributions","phage","vaccine development","antibody responses","idiopathic diseases","protective antibodies","sera of patients","number of labs","immunogens","approach","Researchers","technologies","epitopes","protection","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

Driven by population growth, rising demand for seafood and a levelling of production from capture fisheries, the practice of farming aquatic animals has expanded rapidly to become a major global industry. Aquaculture is now integral to the economies of many countries. It has provided employment and been a major driver of socio-economic development in poor rural and coastal communities, particularly in Asia, and has relieved pressure on the sustainability of the natural harvest from our rivers, lakes and oceans. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture has also been the source of anthropogenic change on a massive scale. Aquatic animals have been displaced from their natural environment, cultured in high density, exposed to environmental stress, provided artificial or unnatural feeds, and a prolific global trade has developed in both live aquatic animals and their products. At the same time, over-exploitation of fisheries and anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems has placed pressure on wild fish populations. Not surprisingly, the consequence has been the emergence and spread of an increasing array of new diseases. This review examines the rise and characteristics of aquaculture, the major viral pathogens of fish and shrimp and their impacts, and the particular characteristics of disease emergence in an aquatic, rather than terrestrial, context. It also considers the potential for future disease emergence in aquatic animals as aquaculture continues to expand and faces the challenges presented by climate change.","publish_time":"2010-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, Peter J.; Winton, James R.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81733b255e52a5becfd870a5eda57d50f8b0579b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2878170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20409453/; https://doi.org/10.1051/vetres/2010022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["live aquatic animals","aquatic ecosystems","characteristics of aquaculture","rise of aquaculture","practice of farming aquatic animals","rapid growth of aquaculture","major global industry","anthropogenic stress","global food production","future disease emergence","particular characteristics of disease emergence","major viral pathogens of fish","prolific global trade","source of anthropogenic change","environmental stress","capture fisheries","levelling of production","major driver of socio-economic development","natural harvest","relieved pressure","natural environment","climate change","population growth","over-exploitation of fisheries","wild fish populations","unnatural feeds","coastal communities","seafood","high density","shrimp","rivers","lakes","demand","Asia","sustainability","impacts","profound changes","potential","increasing array of new diseases","massive scale","years","time","economies","products","countries","oceans","challenges","employment","review","context","consequence"],"language":"en"},

While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present respiratory complications with possible serious lung damage. There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet, though a number are under evaluation, including experimental antivirals. Sofosbuvir, the clinically approved anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug, is also capable of suppressing other families of positive-strand RNA viruses; Flaviviridae and Togaviridae. Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses with conserved polymerase, so SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir. More importantly, sofosbuvir is safe and well tolerated at 400 mg daily in a 24 week therapeutic regimen. Sofosbuvir active metabolite, however, shows an extremely high intracellular stability So, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could also be susceptible to sofosbuvir and we were convinced to design and run a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (in combination with velpatasvir 100 mg, as add-on treatment, in addition to standard of care) on the COVID-19.

In this Review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the types of RNA sensed by RLRs in the contexts of viral infection, malignancies and autoimmune diseases.

Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle. Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4. Our results led us to propose that ORF4 represents a novel minor structural polypeptide, tentatively designated SM (small membrane protein).","publish_time":"1992-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Godet, Murielle; L\u0027Haridon, Rene; Vautherot, Jean-Francois; Laude, Hubert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/099309821b049bd305f2cead24a452779238fec6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290521P; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290521P","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORF4 polypeptide","TGEV ORF4","ORF4 sequence","Anti-ORF4 MAbs","truncated ORF4 recombinant protein","small membrane protein","membrane-associated protein","open reading frame ORF4","integral membrane protein","polypeptide homologous","TGEV-infected cells","TGEV virion preparations","relevant MAbs","Comparison of amino acid sequence data","novel minor structural polypeptide","amino acids","mammalian cells","recombinant product","designated SM","strong evidence","coronaviruses","reactivity","similar size","estimated number","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","insect","finding consistent","coding potential","analysis","prediction","Cexo-Nendo orientation","segment","C-terminal residues","cell surface fluorescence","molecules","expression","Immunofluorescence assays","baculovirus vector","particle","monoclonal antibodies","results","epitopes"],"language":"en"},

A number of aspects of the MLSCN make this initiative unique from other academic screening center. First, all researchers have access to the screening centers through the NIH X01 and R03 funding mechanisms. Second, because of the diverse source of assays and the wide expertise available within the MSLCN, specific biological systems investigated and screened will include: (1) \u201Chigh risk\u201D targets\u2014that is, proteins or biological systems whose function is unknown; (2) targets implicated in orphan diseases or diseases not typically addressed by the private sector; (3) novel or uncommon assay systems; and (4) \u201Cnon-druggable\u201D targets, such as inhibitors of aggregation and protein\u2013protein interactions. Third, the small molecule screening library contains structures not typically found in commercial collections or those housed in pharmaceutical companies. Fourth, as the goal of the MLSCN is to develop selective chemical probes and small molecule tools that will interrogate novel biochemical pathways, the criteria for an acceptable class of molecules is broader for the MLSCN than for those involved in drug discovery and development. Fifth, is the inclusion of integral medicinal chemistry within each MLSCN Center that allows the network to produce chemical probes with particular properties, rather than simply identifying apparent activities from the screening collection.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huryn, Donna M.; Cosford, Nicholas D.P.","journal":"Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bd1459498dfaebcf6baf63e6fb40c532f3b2b1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-7743(07)42026-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287469/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065774307420267; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774307420267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIH Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network","NIH","NIH Roadmap for Medical Research","MLI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MLSCN Center","small-molecule chemical probes","small molecule screening library","academic screening center","targets","screening centers","screening collection","Center Network","NIH Molecular Libraries","small molecule tools","selective chemical probes","NIH X01","Molecular Libraries Initiative","NIH Roadmap","MLI","specific biological systems","uncommon assay systems","initiative unique","basic research","protein interactions","Medical Research","orphan diseases","ultimate goal","novel biochemical pathways","component","wide expertise available","criteria","MSLCN","structures","inhibitors of aggregation","subset","acceptable class of molecules","inclusion of integral medicinal chemistry","Publisher Summary","R03 funding mechanisms","diverse source of assays","function","particular properties","proteins","commercial collections","apparent activities","researchers","access","pharmaceutical companies","drug discovery","private sector","number of aspects","development","availability","high risk","flexibility"],"language":"en"},

NCT00167700), 94 preterm infants (gestational age, \u226532 \u002B 0 and \u226436 \u002B 6 weeks; birth weight, \u003E1500 g) treated at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, were allocated to receive oral prebiotics (galacto-oligosaccharide and polydextrose mixture, 1:1), a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103), or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) between days 3 and 60 of life. The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically defined virus-associated RTI episodes confirmed from nasal swabs by using nucleic acid testing. Secondary outcomes were the severity and duration of RTIs. Results A significantly lower incidence of RTIs was detected in infants receiving prebiotics (rate ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.49; P \u003C .001) or probiotics (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.90; P = .022) compared with those receiving placebo. Also, the incidence of rhinovirus-induced episodes, which comprised 80% of all RTI episodes, was found to be significantly lower in the prebiotic (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.66; P = .003) and probiotic (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.00; P = .051) groups compared with the placebo group. No differences emerged among the study groups in rhinovirus RNA load during infections, duration of rhinovirus RNA shedding, duration or severity of rhinovirus infections, or occurrence of rhinovirus RNA in asymptomatic infants. Conclusions Gut microbiota modification with specific prebiotics and probiotics might offer a novel and cost-effective means to reduce the risk of rhinovirus infections.","publish_time":"2014-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luoto, Raakel; Ruuskanen, Olli; Waris, Matti; Kalliom\u00E4ki, Marko; Salminen, Seppo; Isolauri, Erika","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea0708422bc00075218004425460298c0a1543c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112326.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674913013079; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.08.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674913013079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":["Turku University Hospital","Turku"],"keyphrases":["incidence of rhinovirus","severity of rhinovirus infections","risk of rhinovirus infections","duration of RTIs","rhinovirus RNA load","occurrence of rhinovirus RNA","duration of rhinovirus RNA shedding","associated RTIs","lower incidence of RTIs","asymptomatic infants","placebo group","cohort of preterm infants","specific prebiotics","oral prebiotics","risk of virus","defined virus-associated RTI episodes","probiotics","probiotic supplementation","placebo-controlled trial","induced episodes","prevention of viral respiratory tract infections","study groups","early prebiotic","year of life","Turku University Hospital","nasal swabs","safe strategies","Conclusions Gut microbiota modification","galacto-oligosaccharide","Finland","ATCC","nucleic acid testing","Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG","novel","cost-effective means","days","NCT00167700","rate ratio","Background Simple","polydextrose mixture","birth weight","microcrystalline cellulose","Secondary outcomes","gestational age","primary outcome","weeks","Methods","Objective","differences"],"language":"en"},

All enveloped viruses possess an envelope membrane derived from the host cell, modified with often heavily glycosylated virally encoded glycoproteins important for infectivity, viral particle formation and immune evasion. While N-linked glycosylation of viral envelope proteins is well characterized with respect to location, structure and site occupancy, information on mucin-type O-glycosylation of these proteins is less comprehensive. Studies on viral glycosylation are often limited to analysis of recombinant proteins that in most cases are produced in cell lines with a glycosylation capacity different from the capacity of the host cells. The glycosylation pattern of the produced recombinant glycoproteins might therefore be different from the pattern on native viral proteins. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on analysis of viral glycosylation, and summarize known roles of glycans in the biology of enveloped human viruses. In addition, we describe how to overcome the analytical limitations by using a global approach based on mass spectrometry to identify viral O-glycosylation in virus-infected cell lysates using the complex enveloped virus herpes simplex virus type 1 as a model. We underscore that glycans often pay important contributions to overall protein structure, function and immune recognition, and that glycans represent a crucial determinant for vaccine design. High throughput analysis of glycosylation on relevant glycoprotein formulations, as well as data compilation and sharing is therefore important to identify consensus glycosylation patterns for translational applications.","publish_time":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bagdonaite, Ieva; Wandall, Hans H","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efcdcf807d33027878f4a6acc1412924a15b657b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108637.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwy021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29579213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of viral glycosylation","viral O-glycosylation","glycosylation capacity different","N-linked glycosylation of viral envelope proteins","native viral proteins","consensus glycosylation patterns","mucin-type O-glycosylation","High throughput analysis of glycosylation","Enveloped viruses","viral particle formation","viral hemorrhagic fevers","analysis of recombinant proteins","biology of enveloped human viruses","complex enveloped virus herpes simplex virus type","virus-infected cell lysates","important contributions","encoded glycoproteins important","cell lines","produced recombinant glycoproteins","infections of different severity","known roles of glycans","immune recognition","envelope membrane","immune evasion","host cells","overall protein structure","common human pathogens","infectivity","site occupancy","function","information","relevant glycoprotein formulations","mass spectrometry","global approach","respect","historical perspective","data compilation","location","crucial determinant","sharing","translational applications","cases","vaccine design","lethal disease","analytical limitations","model","symptoms","review","Studies","addition"],"language":"en"},

However, emerging pathogens could pose future threats, particularly those with blood-borne stages that are resistant to viral-inactivation steps in the manufacturing process, such as non-lipid-coated viruses. As outlined in this Review, better understanding of infectious diseases allows challenges from newly described agents of potential concern in the future to be anticipated, but the processes of zoonotic transmission and genetic selection or modification ensure that plasma-derived products will continue to be subject to infectious concerns. Manufacturers of plasma-derived CFC have addressed the issue of emerging infectious agents by developing recombinant products that limit the need for human plasma during production. Such recombinant products have extended the safety profile of their predecessors by ensuring that all reagents used for cell culture, purification steps, and stabilisation and storage buffers are completely independent of human plasma.","publish_time":"2006-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ludlam, Christopher A; Powderly, William G; Bozzette, Samuel; Diamond, Michael; Koerper, Marion A; Kulkarni, Roshni; Ritchie, Bruce; Siegel, Jamie; Simmonds, Peter; Stanley, Samuel; Tapper, Michael L; von Depka, Mario","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40cba5e191966ed333cfa3346d485d5af0791ec0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138062.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673606680367; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606680367","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma-derived products","plasma fractionation","Manufacturers of plasma","independent of human plasma","known infectious agents","issue of emerging infectious agents","infectious concerns","recombinant products","nucleic-acid screening of plasma donations","C viruses","derived CFC","better understanding of infectious diseases","viral-inactivation steps","transfusion-transmissible viruses","human T-cell lymphotropic virus","purification steps","incorporation of viral reduction processes","described agents of potential concern","non-lipid-coated viruses","cell culture","emerging pathogens","future threats","processes of zoonotic transmission","challenges","HIV","modification","hepatitis B","stabilisation","genetic selection","storage buffers","manufacturing process","coagulation-factor","need","result of immunological","blood","reagents","Review","safety profile","terms","predecessors","stages","production","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Although Chinese officials announced in December 2014 that the country would completely cease using organs harvested from prisoners, no regulatory adjustments or changes in China\u2019s organ donation laws followed. As a result, the use of prisoner organs remains legal in China if consent is obtained. DISCUSSION: We have collected and analysed available evidence on human rights violations in the organ procurement practice in China. We demonstrate that the practice not only violates international ethics standards, it is also associated with a large scale neglect of fundamental human rights. This includes organ procurement without consent from prisoners or their families as well as procurement of organs from incompletely executed, still-living prisoners. The human rights critique of these practices will also address the specific situatedness of prisoners, often conditioned and traumatized by a cascade of human rights abuses in judicial structures. CONCLUSION: To end the unethical practice and the abuse associated with it, we suggest to inextricably bind the use of human organs procured in the Chinese transplant system to enacting Chinese legislation prohibiting the use of organs from executed prisoners and making explicit rules for law enforcement. Other than that, the international community must cease to abet the continuation of the present system by demanding an authoritative ban on the use of organs from executed Chinese prisoners.

Background Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was previously reported in hospitalized patients. It is unknown if there is sustained cardiac involvement after patients\u2019 recovery from COVID-19. Methods Twenty-six recovered COVID-19 patients that reported cardiac symptoms and underwent MRI exams were retrospectively included. MRI protocols consisted of conventional sequences (cine, T2WI, LGE), and quantitative mapping sequences (T1, T2, and ECV mapping). Edema ratio and LGE were assessed in post-COVID-19 patients. Cardiac function, native T1/T2, and ECV were quantitatively evaluated and compared with controls. Results Fifteen patients (58%) had abnormal MRI findings on conventional MRI sequences: myocardial edema was found in 14 (54%) patients and LGE was found in 8 (31%) patients. Decreased RV functional parameters including EF, CI, and SV/ BSA were found in patients with positive conventional MRI findings. Using quantitative mapping, global native T1, T2, and ECV were all found to be significantly elevated in patients with positive conventional MRI findings, compared to patients without positive findings and controls (median [IQR], native T1 1271ms [1243-1298] vs 1237ms [1216-1262] vs 1224ms [1217-1245]; mean [SD], T2 42.7ms [3.1] vs 38.1ms [2.4] vs 39.1ms [3.1]; median [IQR], 28.2% [24.8-36.2] vs 24.8% [23.1-25.4] vs 23.7% [22.2-25.2]; p=0.002, p \u003C0.001, and p =0.002, respectively). Conclusions Cardiac involvement was found in a proportion of the recovered COVID-19 patients. MRI manifestation included myocardial edema, fibrosis, and impaired RV function.

In this article, we describe application of an infectious clone system for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1). Similar to previous clones in both flaviviruses and coronaviruses, the approach constructs a panel of contiguous cDNAs that span the DENV genome and can be systematically and directionally assembled to produce viable, full-length viruses. Comparison of the virus derived from the infectious clone with the original viral isolate reveals identical sequence, comparable endpoint titers, and similar focus staining. Both focus-forming assays and percent infection by flow cytometry revealed overlapping replication levels in two different cell types. Moreover, serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) bound similarly to infectious clone and the natural isolate. Using the clone, we were able to insert a DENV4 type-specific epitope recognized by primate MAb 5H2 into envelope (E) protein domain I (EDI) of DENV1 and recover a viable chimeric recombinant virus. The recombinant DENV1 virus was recognized and neutralized by the DENV4 type-specific 5H2 MAb. The introduction of the 5H2 epitope ablated two epitopes on DENV1 EDI recognized by human MAbs (1F4 and 14C10) that strongly neutralize DENV1. Together, the work demonstrates the utility of the infectious clone and provides a resource to rapidly manipulate the DENV1 serotype for generation of recombinant and mutant viruses. IMPORTANCE Dengue viruses (DENVs) are significant mosquito-transmitted pathogens that cause widespread infection and can lead to severe infection and complications. Here we further characterize a novel and robust DENV serotype 1 (DENV1) infectious clone system that can be used to support basic and applied research. We demonstrate how the system can be used to probe the antigenic relationships between strains by creating viable recombinant viruses that display or lack major antibody epitopes. The DENV1 clone system and recombinant viruses can be used to analyze existing vaccine immune responses and inform second-generation bivalent vaccine designs.","publish_time":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallichotte, Emily N.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Yount, Boyd L.; Widman, Douglas G.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Hartman, Steven; de Silva, Aravinda M.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2943228f12c0cb46c035893d848410ff23686595.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5322348.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00380-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28251184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","EDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV1 clone system","DENV1 serotype","recombinant DENV1 virus","infectious clone system","DENV1 EDI","viable recombinant viruses","generation of recombinant","full-length viruses","robust DENV serotype","generation of mutant viruses","viable chimeric recombinant virus","IMPORTANCE Dengue viruses","5H2 epitope","DENV genome","DENV4 type-specific 5H2 MAb","DENV4 type-specific epitope","serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies","percent infection","primate MAb 5H2","widespread infection","severe infection","original viral isolate","similar focus staining","viral serotypes","human MAbs","natural isolate","applied research","existing vaccine immune responses","second-generation bivalent vaccine designs","lack major antibody epitopes","absence of robust reverse genetic systems","overlapping replication levels","comparable endpoint titers","flow cytometry","identical sequence","envelope","DENVs","significant mosquito-transmitted pathogens","coronaviruses","approach","flaviviruses","assays","protein domain","propagation","strains","different cell types","panel of contiguous cDNAs","previous clones","1F4","14C10","clinical relevance","application","resource","antigenic relationships","utility","novel","complications","work","introduction","article","Comparison"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: Describe the epidemiology of selected non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses in Thailand between June 2010 and May 2014 using a sentinel surveillance platform established for influenza. METHODS: Patients with influenza\u2010like illness (ILI; history of fever or documented temperature \u226538\u00B0C, cough, not requiring hospitalization) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI; history of fever or documented temperature \u226538\u00B0C, cough, onset \u003C10 days, requiring hospitalization) were enrolled from 10 sites. Throat swabs were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1\u20103, and adenoviruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010PCR. RESULTS: We screened 15 369 persons with acute respiratory infections and enrolled 8106 cases of ILI (5069 cases \u003C15 years old) and 1754 cases of SARI (1404 cases \u003C15 years old). Among ILI cases \u003C15 years old, influenza viruses (1173, 23%), RSV (447, 9%), and adenoviruses (430, 8%) were the most frequently identified respiratory viruses tested, while for SARI cases \u003C15 years old, RSV (196, 14%) influenza (157, 11%) and adenoviruses (90, 6%) were the most common. The RSV season significantly overlapped the larger influenza season from July to November in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: The global expansion of influenza sentinel surveillance provides an opportunity to gather information on the characteristics of cases positive for non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses, particularly seasonality, although adjustments to case definitions may be required.","publish_time":"2018-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Waicharoen, Sunthareeya; Yingyong, Thitipong; Praphasiri, Prabda; Sangkitporn, Somchai; Olsen, Sonja J.; Lindblade, Kim A.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc7b398903c7449fb32f99cdc953c8bbbd600bc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6005612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518269/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12554","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","RSV"],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["seasonality of non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses","cases of SARI","SARI cases","cases of ILI","ILI cases","epidemiology of selected non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses","larger influenza season","parainfluenza viruses","years old","acute respiratory infections","characteristics of cases positive","global expansion of influenza sentinel surveillance","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV season","adenoviruses","severe acute respiratory infection","history of fever","PCR","documented temperature","hospitalization","Information","cough","Thailand","sentinel surveillance platform","metapneumovirus","real\u2010time reverse transcriptase","polymerase chain reaction","MPV","persons","burden","illness","opportunity","onset","adjustments","tropical countries","case definitions","days","PIV","Patients","CONCLUSIONS","Throat swabs","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","sites"],"language":"en"},

Parasites and pathogens of wildlife can threaten biodiversity, infect humans and domestic animals, and cause significant economic losses, providing incentives to manage wildlife diseases. Recent insights from disease ecology have helped transform our understanding of infectious disease dynamics and yielded new strategies to better manage wildlife diseases. Simultaneously, wildlife disease management (WDM) presents opportunities for large\u2010scale empirical tests of disease ecology theory in diverse natural systems. 2. To assess whether the potential complementarity between WDM and disease ecology theory has been realized, we evaluate the extent to which specific concepts in disease ecology theory have been explicitly applied in peer\u2010reviewed WDM literature. 3. While only half of WDM articles published in the past decade incorporated disease ecology theory, theory has been incorporated with increasing frequency over the past 40 years. Contrary to expectations, articles authored by academics were no more likely to apply disease ecology theory, but articles that explain unsuccessful management often do so in terms of theory. 4. Some theoretical concepts such as density\u2010dependent transmission have been commonly applied, whereas emerging concepts such as pathogen evolutionary responses to management, biodiversity\u2013disease relationships and within\u2010host parasite interactions have not yet been fully integrated as management considerations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Theory\u2010based disease management can meet the needs of both academics and managers by testing disease ecology theory and improving disease interventions. Theoretical concepts that have received limited attention to date in wildlife disease management could provide a basis for improving management and advancing disease ecology in the future.","publish_time":"2013-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joseph, Maxwell B.; Mihaljevic, Joseph R.; Arellano, Ana Lisette; Kueneman, Jordan G.; Preston, Daniel L.; Cross, Paul C.; Johnson, Pieter T.

This study aimed to use high throughput screening to identify the viruses in fecal guano of Taiwanese insectivorous bats caves in order to obtain more information on bat-derived pathogenic viruses in East Asia. Guano samples were collected from two caves in Taiwan, pooled, and then subjected to Multiplex PCR-based next generation sequencing for viral identification. Subsequently, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) sequence was detected and confirmed by reverse transcription PCR. EMCV is considered as rodent virus and thus, animal species identification through cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcoding was further done to identify the viral source. Finally, determination of distribution and verification of the presence of EMCV in guano obtained from Japanese and South Korean caves was also done. We concluded that the guano collected was not contaminated with the excrement of rodents which were reported and presumed to live in Taiwan. Also, EMCV genome fragments were found in guanos of Japanese and South Korean caves. It is possible that the eastern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) is one of the natural hosts of EMCV in East Asia.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doysabas, Karla Cristine C.; Oba, Mami; Furuta, Masaya; Iida, Keisuke; Omatsu, Tsutomu; Furuya, Tetsuya; Okada, Takashi; Sutummaporn, Kripitch; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Wong, Min-Liang; Wu, Chung-Hsin; Ohmori, Yasushige; Kobayashi, Ryosuke; Hengjan, Yupadee; Yonemitsu, Kenzo; Kuwata, Ryusei; Kim, Yoo-Kyung; Han, Sang-Hyun; Sohn, Joon-Hyuk; Han, Sang-Hoon; Suzuki, Kazuo; Kimura, Junpei; Maeda, Ken; Oh, Hong-Shik; Endoh, Daiji; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Hondo, Eiichi","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a0018c92f1de802d41d8d051bc3edda9637f303.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114854.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218305768; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218305768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30391400/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.10.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex","EMCV"],"locations":["East Asia"],"keyphrases":["identification of viruses","presence of EMCV","South Korean caves","natural hosts of EMCV","zoonotic viruses","viral identification","Guano samples","EMCV genome fragments","fecal guano of Taiwanese insectivorous bats caves","bat-derived pathogenic viruses","East Asia","animal species identification","guanos of Japanese","reservoir hosts","Abstract Bats","rodent virus","encephalomyocarditis virus","Multiplex PCR","viral source","reverse transcription PCR","eastern bent-wing bat","cytochrome oxidase","order","information","Miniopterus fuliginosus","generation sequencing","high throughput screening","COI","verification","sequence","study","barcoding","determination of distribution","excrement of rodents"],"language":"en"},

CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging. This finding may have potential implications for future research utilising this cell line.","publish_time":"2019-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawson, J.S.; Syme, H.M.; Wheeler-Jones, C.P.D.; Elliott, J.","journal":"Res Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6863388.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6863388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRFK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CRFK cells","feline fibroblasts","primary feline proximal tubular epithelial cells","primary feline renal cells","feline cortical fibroblasts","mesenchymal transition","Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell","immortalised cell line","comparison","cell adhesion molecules","mesenchymal intermediate filament","neoplastic transformation","FCF","S100A4 gene expression","enzyme cytochemistry","lacked expression","brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC","desmin","endothelial marker","western blotting","RT-qPCR","protein vimentin","cytokeratin","immunofluorescence","future research","Willebrand factor","CD29","CD44","fusiform morphology","potential implications","vWF","growth of certain vaccinal viruses","finding","extensive passaging","study","phenotype","addition","aim","Confusion"],"language":"en"},

However, best methods of educating pet owners about antimicrobial stewardship have yet to be defined. While visual materials such as brochures and posters are often used in health promotion campaigns, their effectiveness in veterinary medicine is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether pet owners noticed and retained the message of a poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message placed in veterinary clinic exam rooms. A total of 111 pet owners from five veterinary clinics (three general practices, two low-cost clinics) in the greater Philadelphia area participated in the study. Participants completed a survey asking whether they noticed the poster and if they could paraphrase its message. In a follow-up survey, an antibiotic knowledge score was calculated from answers to questions assessing their knowledge of the poster message. Baseline knowledge was assessed by asking participants to define antibiotic resistance. At the end of the study, veterinarians at participating clinics were interviewed about their experiences with the poster. Only 51 (46.4%) participants noticed the poster, and only 11 (9.9%) could partially or completely reproduce its message. No demographic or clinic-level factors were significantly associated with noticing the poster or recalling its message. Antibiotic knowledge scores were highly correlated (\u03C1 = 0.87, p \u003C 0.001) with baseline knowledge and not affected by viewing the poster (p = 0.955). Veterinarians expressed skepticism that the poster was effective in conveying a message of judicious antibiotic use to clients and noted no difference in the frequency with which they discussed antibiotic resistance or felt pressured to prescribe antibiotics by their clients. Posters alone will likely have limited impact in conveying a message of judicious antibiotic use to pet owners. However, they might be useful as part of an active, multi-modal education strategy, especially if complemented by veterinarian actions.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Redding, Laurel E.; Cole, Stephen D.","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e7a017e7e61ae4634cd4be5ad5646470e43054d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6883349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6883349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Philadelphia"],"keyphrases":["poster message","Pet owners","antimicrobial stewardship message","message of judicious antibiotic use","Antibiotic knowledge scores","antibiotic resistance","veterinary clinics","Baseline knowledge","veterinary medicine","study","Participants","low-cost clinics","participating clinics","veterinary clinic exam rooms","posters","clients","veterinarians","follow-up survey","clinic-level factors","effectiveness","general practices","answers","health promotion campaigns","greater Philadelphia area","pets","questions","important role","multi-modal education strategy","limited impact","best methods","visual materials","brochures","demographic","antibiotics","difference","frequency","skepticism","experiences","antimicrobials","end","total","veterinarian actions","objective"],"language":"en"},

Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrera-Diestra, Jos\u00E9 L.; Meyers, Lauren Ancel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23d0641f1f78528bbf3fa7b0b749abc1299a9cb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6890219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6890219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strategies","number of social contacts","number of infected acquaintances","proportion of social contacts","infected family members","social distancing measures","fewest intervention resources","local factors","global factors","slow transmission","recommended intervention","public adherence","overall disease prevalence","public health agencies","infectious disease outbreaks","vaccination","midst","indirect protection","plausible heterogeneity","mathematical models","growing outbreak","network","news media","substantial herd effect","human contact patterns","large fraction","precautions","self isolating","vaccinating","modes of epidemiological decision-making","friends","infections","Individual willingness","population","Individuals","success"],"language":"en"},

ZIKV Natal RGN strain, an Asian-lineage virus, has been identified in brain tissues from fetal autopsy cases with microcephaly and is suggested to be a neurotropic variant. However, ZIKV Natal RGN strain has not been isolated; its biological features are not yet illustrated. This study rescued and characterized recombinant, single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) of the ZIKV Natal RGN strain using reverse genetic and synthetic biology techniques. The DNA-launched replicon of ZIKV Natal RGN was constructed and contains the EGFP reporter, lacks prM-E genes, and replicates under CMV promoter control. The peak in the ZIKV Natal RGN SRIP titer reached 6.25 \u00D7 10(6) TCID50/mL in the supernatant of prM-E-expressing packaging cells 72 h post-transfection with a ZIKV Natal RGN replicon. The infectivity of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs has been demonstrated to correlate with the green florescence intensity of the EGFP reporter, the SRIP-induced cytopathic effect, and ZIKV\u2019s non-structural protein expression. Moreover, ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs effectively self-replicated in rhabdomyosarcoma/muscle, glioblastoma/astrocytoma, and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, displaying unique cell susceptibility with differential attachment activity. Therefore, the recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN strain was rescued as SRIPs that could be used to elucidate the biological features of a neurotropic strain regarding cell tropism and pathogenic components, apply for antiviral agent screening, and develop vaccine candidates.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Chien-Yi; Lin, Chen-Sheng; Lai, Hsueh-Chou; Yu, Ya-Wen; Liao, Chih-Yi; Su, Wen-Chi; Ko, Bo-Han; Chang, Young-Sheng; Huang, Su-Hua; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05f1c02ecdb1798e85e750ddfa81ede861f94cf6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893733.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV Natal RGN","EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV Natal RGN replicon","replicon of ZIKV Natal RGN","recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN strain","infectivity of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs","ZIKV Natal RGN SRIP titer","neurotropic strain","EGFP reporter","biological features","prM-E genes","Asian-lineage virus","genetic variation","packaging cells","cell tropism","Asian lineages","characterized recombinant","supernatant of prM","neurotropic variant","Zika virus","unique cell susceptibility","retinal pigmented epithelial cells","astrocytoma","h post-transfection","pathogenic components","rhabdomyosarcoma","glioblastoma","cytopathic effect","replicates","antiviral agent screening","fetal autopsy cases","muscle","brain tissues","differential attachment activity","synthetic biology techniques","infectious particles","ZIKV\u2019s non-structural protein expression","Aedes mosquitoes","microcephaly","CMV promoter control","green florescence intensity","peak","vaccine candidates","study","DNA","TCID50"],"language":"en"},

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a promising cytokine that is critical in protecting the lung during infection. This cytokine is strongly regulated by the soluble receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP), which is constitutively expressed in the lungs where it inhibits IL-22 activity. The IL-22/IL-22BP axis is thought to prevent chronic exposure of epithelial cells to IL-22. However, the importance of this axis is not understood during an infection such as influenza. Here we demonstrate through the use of IL-22BP-knockout mice (il-22ra2(\u2212/\u2212)) that a pro-IL-22 environment reduces pulmonary inflammation during H1N1 (PR8/34 H1N1) infection and protects the lung by promoting tight junction formation. We confirmed these results in normal human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro demonstrating improved membrane resistance and induction of the tight junction proteins Cldn4, Tjp1, and Tjp2. Importantly, we show that administering recombinant IL-22 in vivo reduces inflammation and fluid leak into the lung. Taken together, our results demonstrate the IL-22/IL-22BP axis is a potential targetable pathway for reducing influenza-induced pneumonia.","publish_time":"2019-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hebert, K.

This study determined the effects of PEDV infection on intestinal absorption and the expression of genes for nutrient transporters via biochemical tests and microarray analysis. Sixteen 7-day-old healthy piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated to one of two groups. After 5-day adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) were orally administrated with either sterile saline or PEDV (the strain from Yunnan province) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. All pigs were orally infused D-xylose (0.1 g/kg BW) on day 5 post PEDV or saline administration. One hour later, jugular vein blood samples as well as intestinal samples were collected for further analysis. In comparison with the control group, PEDV infection increased diarrhea incidence, blood diamine oxidase activity, and iFABP level, while reducing growth and plasma D-xylose concentration in piglets. Moreover, PEDV infection altered plasma and jejunal amino acid profiles, and decreased the expression of aquaporins and amino acid transporters (L-type amino acid transporter 1, sodium-independent amino acid transporter, B(\u00B0(,\u002B))-type amino acid transport protein, sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 1, sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter 3, and peptide transporter (1), lipid transport and metabolism-related genes (lipoprotein lipase, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein A4, apolipoprotein C2, solute carrier family 27 member 2, solute carrier family 27 member 4, fatty acid synthase, and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (3), and glucose transport genes (glucose transporter-2 and insulin receptor) in the jejunum. However, PEDV administration increased mRNA levels for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, argininosuccinate synthase 1, sodium/glucose co-transporter-1, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the jejunum.

We performed an in vitro study to evaluate the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of patients with ESRD (n = 34) and in healthy controls (n = 30). The concentrations of interleukins (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and viral load cycle threshold (Ct) were measured in the dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03B1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03B1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection.

Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of ~10(5) focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD(50) \u003C 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1vila-P\u00E9rez, Gines; Nogales, Aitor; Park, Jun-Gyu; M\u00E1rquez-Jurado, Silvia; Iborra, Francisco J.; Almazan, Fernando; Mart\u00EDnez-Sobrido, Luis","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a72473db86f1e26d0d1e6db3e7078a3536b9ba65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6934710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV virulence","virulence of ZIKV","treatment of ZIKV","ZIKV-Paraiba infection","ZIKV NS2A protein","future ZIKV outbreaks","related ZIKV strains","validated mouse model of ZIKV infection","infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone","amino acid substitution A117V","identification of virulence factors","valine substitution","attenuated rZIKV-RGN","virulent Paraiba","MLD","future outbreaks","FFUs","single amino acid alanine","non-structural protein","Zika virus","mouse lethal dose","immune responses","host","significant differences","human public health","genetic risk-assessment marker","association","Brazil","Rio Grande","region","recent outbreak","replication","Norte Natal","position","antivirals available","changes","major concerns","natural polymorphism","viral-induced apoptosis","period of time","data","approved vaccines","deep-sequencing analysis","results","sense","effective countermeasures","units","neurological disorders","viruses","focus","lethality","Intensive effort","mechanism of action","spite"],"language":"en"},

Although numerous advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures remain largely unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with the progression of heart failure. METHODS: We generated multi-level transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from 21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample, we applied lasso regression model to identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma level in a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression. RESULTS: Based on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially expressed genes [mRNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the study cohort. The follow-up functional annotation and regulatory network analyses revealed their potential roles in regulating extracellular matrix. We further identified several genes that were associated with fibrosis. By using the survival time before transplantation, COL1A1 was identified as a potential biomarker for HF progression and its upregulation was confirmed by both IHC and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, COL1A1 content \u2265 256.5 ng/ml in plasma was found to be associated with poor survival within 1 year of heart transplantation from heart failure [hazard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 15.8, Log-rank p value \u003C 1.0 \u00D7 10(\u2212 4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that COL1A1 might be a plasma biomarker of HF and associated with HF progression, especially to predict the 1-year survival from HF onset to transplantation.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Xiumeng; Wang, Yin-Ying; Jia, Peilin; Xiong, Qing; Hu, Yiqing; Chang, Yuan; Lai, Songqing; Xu, Yong; Zhao, Zhongming; Song, Jiangping","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9657835a6c85a14a39591e957cb783b56bb5f333.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6943904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6943904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzExNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Masson"],"organizations":["IHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HF progression","HF patients","HF onset","plasma biomarker of HF","progression of heart failure","study cohort","year of heart transplantation","validation cohort","independent cohort","plasma level","role of genes","cohort of left ventricular heart tissue","year survival","multi-level transcriptomic data","potential roles","potential biomarkers","survival time","poor survival","COL1A1 content","qRT-PCR","IHC","fibrosis percentage","healthy donors","RESULTS","present prospective follow-up study","Masson staining","follow-up functional annotation","regulatory network analyses","HR","hazard ratio","high rate of hospitalization","sample","microRNAs","lncRNAs","non-coding RNAs","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA","morbidity","aim","lasso regression model","upregulation","global pandemic","confidence interval","representative molecular signatures","Log-rank p value","CI","extracellular matrix","mRNAs","METHODS","immunohistochemistry","BACKGROUND","mortality","CONCLUSIONS","numerous advances"],"language":"en"},

AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-C-methylguanosine-5\u0027-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1\u20135, ranged from 5\u201328 nM. The active 5\u0027-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1\u20135 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 \u03BCM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values \u226525 \u03BCM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.","publish_time":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Good, Steven S.; Moussa, Adel; Zhou, Xiao-Jian; Pietropaolo, Keith; Sommadossi, Jean-Pierre","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/095424c03a6e78279e47488552d961bc328f9c84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6949113.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","EC","SOF","CYP","HCV DAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV DAA","HCV laboratory strains","clinical isolates of HCV genotypes","potent HCV replication antivirals","HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","active triphosphate","ongoing clinical development","panel of laboratory strains","treatment duration","selected RNA","SVR rates","triphosphate metabolite","\u03BCM","human hepatocytes","patient populations","fold","treatment of hepatitis C virus","potent guanosine analogs PSI","prior treatment experience","human DNA polymerases","panel of CYP enzymes","DNA viruses","C-methylguanosine","predominant metabolite","novel phosphoramidate prodrug","infections","cytotoxicity","regimens","viral response","effective direct-acting antiviral","mitochondrial toxicity","cirrhosis","favorable preclinical attributes","concentrations","S282T resistance-associated variants","half-life","multiple species","sofosbuvir","cytochrome P450","mutagenic O","alkylguanine bases","availability","3A4","monophosphate","values","fluoro","different class","activity","hemi-sulfate salt","patients","combination","rats","monkeys","high levels","potency","nM","liver"],"language":"en"},

Even the functions of the influenza proteins, their mechanisms of action and interaction with host proteins have not been fully revealed. These questions have traditionally been studied in mammalian animal models, mainly ferrets and mice (as well as pigs and non-human primates) and in cell lines. Although obviously relevant as models to humans, these experimental systems are very complex and are not conveniently accessible to various genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches. The fact that influenza remains an unsolved problem, in combination with the limitations of the conventional experimental models, motivated increasing attempts to use the power of other models, such as low eukaryotes, including invertebrate, and primary cell cultures. In this review, we summarized the efforts to study influenza in yeast, Drosophila, zebrafish and primary human tissue cultures and the major contributions these studies have made toward a better understanding of the disease.

These results indicate that oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant improves the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in healthy young children at the first-time seasonal influenza vaccination.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yu-Ju; Wen, Chiao-Ni; Lin, Ying-Ying; Hsieh, Wen-Chi; Chang, Chia-Chen; Chen, Yi-Hsuan; Hsu, Chian-Hui; Shih, Yun-Jui; Chen, Chang-Hsun; Fang, Chi-Tai","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24de96fb097297663fc32f1f3781693bdb2f2fec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/17e65e5ee1427a61375b03b51013d7e1b4cf9bdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6965081.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965081/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["better influenza vaccines","non-adjuvanted vaccines","water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines","efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines","Standard inactivated influenza vaccines","naive young children","non-naive children","naive healthy young children","non-adjuvanted counterparts","first-time seasonal influenza vaccination","clinical trials","efficacy data","better protection","randomized controlled trials","Oil","water emulsion adjuvant","similar protection","weighted estimates","immunogenicity data","inconsistent results","risk ratio of RT","seroprotection rate ratio","promising candidates","PCR","unmet need","complications"],"language":"en"},

Released from the post-pituitary gland, vasopressin induces vasoconstriction through the activation of V1a receptors located on vascular smooth muscle cells. Due to its non-selective receptor affinity arginine\u2013vasopressin also activates V2 (located on renal tubular cells of collecting ducts) and V1b (located in the anterior pituitary and in the pancreas) receptors, thereby potentially promoting undesired side effects such as anti-diuresis, procoagulant properties due to release of the von Willebrand\u2019s factor and platelet activation. Finally, it also cross-activates oxytocin receptors. During septic shock, vasopressin plasma levels were reported to be lower than expected, and a hypersensitivity to its vasopressor effect is reported in such situation. Terlipressin and selepressin are synthetic vasopressin analogues with a higher affinity for the V1 receptor, and, hence, potentially less side effects. In this narrative review, we present the current knowledge of the rationale, benefits and risks of vasopressin use in the setting of septic shock and vasoplegic shock following cardiac surgery. Clearly, vasopressin administration allows reducing norepinephrine requirements, but so far, no improvement of survival was reported and side effects are frequent, particularly ischaemic events. Finally, we will discuss the current indications for vasopressin and its agonists in the setting of septic shock, and the remaining unresolved questions.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demiselle, Julien; Fage, Nicolas; Radermacher, Peter; Asfar, Pierre","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb7188b6b757f861a44b36eacc1f00b446cefe5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6975768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6975768/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vasopressin administration","synthetic vasopressin analogues","risks of vasopressin use","vasopressin plasma levels","setting of septic shock","effects","vasoplegic shock","Activation of arginine","activation of V1a receptors","oxytocin receptors","platelet activation","non-selective receptor affinity arginine","higher affinity","current knowledge","anterior pituitary","current indications","V1 receptor","renal tubular cells","post-pituitary gland","vascular smooth muscle cells","vasoconstriction","benefits","V2","agonists","anti-diuresis","release","rationale","procoagulant properties","hormonal responses","cardiac surgery","ducts","Willebrand\u2019s factor","V1b","Terlipressin","selepressin","vasodilation-related hypotension","remaining unresolved questions","vasopressor effect","hypersensitivity","ischaemic events","norepinephrine requirements","pancreas","narrative review","situation","improvement of survival"],"language":"en"},

Assessment of the baseline antibody repertoires of unimmunized model animals will be useful as a benchmark for future immunization experiments. We characterized the heavy chain and kappa light chain antibody repertoires of a model animal, the OmniRat, by high throughput antibody sequencing and made use of two novel datasets for comparison to human repertoires. Intra-animal and inter-animal repertoire comparisons reveal a high level of conservation in antibody diversity between the lymph node and spleen and between members of the species. Multiple differences were found in both the heavy and kappa chain repertoires between OmniRats and humans including gene segment usage, CDR3 length distributions, class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation levels and in features of V(D)J recombination. The Inference and Generation of Repertoires (IGoR) software tool was used to model recombination in VH regions which allowed for the quantification of some of these differences. Diversity estimates of the OmniRat heavy chain repertoires almost reached that of humans, around two orders of magnitude less. Despite variation between the species repertoires, a high frequency of OmniRat clonotypes were also found in the human repertoire.

The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a tool (CCU-OHQoL) to assess OHQoL amongst patients admitted to CCU, (ii) to collect data to analyse the validity, reliability and acceptability of the CCU-OHQoL tool and (iii) to investigate patient-reported outcome measures of OHQoL in patients hospitalised in a CCU. METHODS: The project included three phases: (1) the development of an initial questionnaire informed by a literature review and expert panel, (2) testing of the tool in CCU (n = 18) followed by semi-structured interviews to assess acceptability, face and content validity and (3) final tool modification and testing of CCU-OHQoL questionnaire to assess validity and reliability. RESULTS: The CCU-OHQoL showed good face and content validity and was quick to administer. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.72 suggesting good internal consistency. For construct validity, the CCU-OHQoL was strongly and significantly correlated (correlation coefficients 0.71, 0.62 and 0.77, p \u003C 0.01) with global OHQoL items. In the validation study, 37.8% of the participants reported a deterioration in self-reported oral health after CCU admission. Finally, 26.9% and 31% of the participants reported considerable negative impacts of oral health in their life overall and quality of life, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The new CCU-OHQoL tool may be of use in the assessment of oral health-related quality of life in CCU patients. Deterioration of OHQoL seems to be common in CCU patients.

AIMS: The objective of this research effort was to conduct the first countrywide survey on the status quo of sedation analgesia as delivered to children and adolescents in Germany. METHODS: We dispatched letters to all pediatric hospital settings in Germany (n = 305), including a questionnaire that had been developed with existing guidelines taken into account. Its items were designed to elucidate the current practice of PSA throughout these pediatric centers regarding (a) organizational structures and (b) standards of medication and staffing. RESULTS: A total of 138 centers returned the questionnaire, hence the response rate was 45.2%. Numerous centers had implemented adequate structures and staffing standards. Deficits were nevertheless identified, most notably in terms of on-location equipment and staff provided to deliver sedations. Essential items of equipment were not provided in up to 26.8% of centers. Adequate staffing was not provided in up to 44.2% of centers, depending on the diagnostic or interventional procedures for which the PSA was delivered. The most widely used sedative agents were midazolam, ketamine/esketamine, and propofol. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate care structures for the management of procedural sedation analgesia have been implemented by many pediatric centers in Germany.

This study aimed to exploratively develop a standardized preparedness system to use during unfolding threats of severe infectious diseases. METHODS: A qualitative three-step study among infectious disease prevention and control experts was performed. First, interviews (n = 5) were conducted to identify which factors trigger preparedness activities during an unfolding threat.

This occurs, for instance, when two pathogens cooperate, while at the same time, multiple strains of these pathogens co-circulate and compete. Notable examples include the cooperation of human immunodeficiency virus with antibiotic-resistant and susceptible strains of tuberculosis or some respiratory infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Models focusing on competition or cooperation separately fail to describe how these concurrent interactions shape the epidemiology of such diseases. We studied this problem considering two cooperating pathogens, where one pathogen is further structured in two strains. The spreading follows a susceptible-infected-susceptible process and the strains differ in transmissibility and extent of cooperation with the other pathogen. We combined a mean-field stability analysis with stochastic simulations on networks considering both well-mixed and structured populations. We observed the emergence of a complex phase diagram, where the conditions for the less transmissible, but more cooperative strain to dominate are non-trivial, e.g. non-monotonic boundaries and bistability. Coupled with community structure, the presence of the cooperative pathogen enables the coexistence between strains by breaking the spatial symmetry and dynamically creating different ecological niches. These results shed light on ecological mechanisms that may impact the epidemiology of diseases of public health concern.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinotti, Francesco; Ghanbarnejad, Fakhteh; H\u00F6vel, Philipp; Poletto, Chiara","journal":"R Soc Open Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2d3180f62fca804b21c27e036c9e7cf4e4cf35d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/caa9fc5fe24d9650a99364c1e54f45eaa359a8ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7029927.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029927/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple strains","susceptible strains of tuberculosis","Streptococcus pneumoniae strains","cooperative pathogen","cooperating pathogens","pathogens co-","susceptible-infected","susceptible process","ecological mechanisms","ecological systems","extent of cooperation","epidemiology of diseases","different ecological niches","cooperation of human immunodeficiency virus","cooperative strain","heterogeneous interactions","concurrent interactions","structured populations","non-monotonic boundaries","stochastic simulations","networks","antibiotic-resistant","respiratory infections","mean-field stability analysis","spatial symmetry","complex phase diagram","conditions","public health concern","presence","transmissibility","coexistence","Notable examples","emergence","bistability","results","light","place","time","community structure","Models","competition","spreading","problem","instance"],"language":"en"},

To investigate possible variations in species-specific cell tropism and local replication of vaccine virus, different reservoir species including foxes, raccoon dogs, raccoons, mongooses, dogs and skunks were orally immunised with a highly attenuated, high-titred GFP-expressing rabies virus (RABV). Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR screenings revealed clear differences among species suggesting host specific limitations to ORV. While for responsive species the palatine tonsils (tonsilla palatina) were identified as a main site of virus replication, less virus dissemination was observed in the tonsils of rather refractory species. While our comparison of vaccine virus tropism emphasizes the important role that the tonsilla palatina plays in eliciting an immune response to ORV, our data also indicate that other lymphoid tissues may have a more important role than originally anticipated. Overall, these data support a model in which the susceptibility to oral live RABV vaccine infection of lymphatic tissue is a major determinant in vaccination efficacy.

Example from a family-based intervention in Kenya","doi":"10.1186/s13033-020-00343-0","pmcid":"PMC7031864","pubmed_id":"32099580","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: A key focus of health systems strengthening in low- and middle-income countries is increasing reach and access through task-shifting. As such models become more common, it is critical to understand the experiences of lay providers because they are on the forefront for delivering care services. A greater understanding would improve lay provider support and help them provide high-quality care. This is especially the case for those providing mental health services, as providing psychological care may pose unique stressors. We sought to understand experiences of lay counselors, focusing on identity, motivation, self-efficacy, stress, and burnout. The goal was to understand how taking on a new provider role influences their lives beyond simply assuming a new task, which would in turn help identify actionable steps to improve interventions with task-shifting components. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and focus group discussions (n = 3) were conducted with three lay counselor groups with varying levels of experience delivering a community-based family therapy intervention in Eldoret, Kenya. Thematic analysis was conducted, including intercoder reliability checks. A Stress Map was created to visualize stress profiles using free-listing and pile-sorting data collected during interviews and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Counselors described high intrinsic motivation to become counselors and high self-efficacy after training. They reported positive experiences in the counselor role, with new skills improving their counseling and personal lives. As challenges arose, including client engagement difficulties and balancing many responsibilities, stress and burnout increased, dampening motivation and self-efficacy. In response, counselors described coping strategies, including seeking peer and supervisor support, that restored their motivation to persevere. At case completion, they again experienced high self-efficacy and a desire to continue. CONCLUSIONS: Findings informed suggestions for ways to incorporate support for lay providers into task-shifting interventions at initiation, during training, and throughout implementation. These include acknowledging and preparing counselors for challenges during training, increasing explicit attention to counselor stress in supervision, fostering peer support among lay providers, and ensuring a fair balance between workload and compensation. Improving and building an evidence base around practices for supporting lay providers will improve the effectiveness and sustainability of lay provider-delivered interventions.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wall, Jonathan T.; Kaiser, Bonnie N.; Friis-Healy, Elsa A.; Ayuku, David; Puffer, Eve S.","journal":"Int J Ment Health Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83b26ec8caeadb67f6cfd202835c9cb22c731d8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7031864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031864/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["experiences of lay counselors","lay provider support","experiences of lay providers","counselor stress","lay counselor groups","sustainability of lay provider","high self-efficacy","new task","peer support","stress profiles","interventions","Stress Map","training","high intrinsic motivation","new provider role","supervisor support","counselor role","dampening motivation","care services","new skills","challenges","burnout","psychological care","high-quality care","positive experiences","group discussions","key focus of health systems","mental health services","seeking peer","personal lives","turn help","case completion","Semi-structured interviews","supervision","community-based family therapy intervention","varying levels of experience","explicit attention","ways","free-listing","coping strategies","pile-sorting data","Eldoret","responsibilities","actionable steps","effectiveness","identity","middle-income countries","fair balance","client engagement difficulties","Kenya","reach","access","suggestions","METHODS","counseling","practices","RESULTS","greater understanding","evidence base","intercoder reliability checks","workload","compensation","CONCLUSIONS","Findings","unique stressors","response","BACKGROUND","forefront","initiation","desire","Thematic analysis","acknowledging","components","models","implementation","goal"],"language":"en"},

Setting NetMHCpan4.0 to predict 11-14mer length did not improve the prediction (37\u201379 of 93 peptides) with an inverse correlation between the number of predictions and length set. Late time point peptides were significantly stronger binders than early peptides (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.0000005). MHCflurry1.2.0 similarly predicted all but 2 of the peptides that NetMHCpan4.0 predicted and NetCTL1.2 predicted only 14 of the 93 experimental peptides. CONCLUSION: NetMHCpan4.0 class I epitope predictions covered 95% of the epitope responses identified in six HIV-1 infected individuals, and would have reduced the number of experimental confirmatory tests by \u003E 80%. Algorithmic epitope prediction in conjunction with HLA allele frequency information can cost-effectively assist immunogen design through minimizing the experimental effort.","publish_time":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bugembe, Daniel Lule; Ekii, Andrew Obuku; Ndembi, Nicaise; Serwanga, Jennifer; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Pala, Pietro","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41404655b3baecaaeae88faa63966860dd99706e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7036183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":["Wilcoxon"],"keyphrases":["NetMHCpan4","experimental peptides","HIV","early peptides","epitope predictions","matched HLA class","number of predictions","epitope responses","mer length","set length","length set","mapped epitopes","T-cell epitopes","various HLA types","Late time point peptides","Algorithmic epitope prediction","computational methods","experimental effort","infected individuals","NetCTL1","MHCflurry1","HLA allele frequency information","number of experimental confirmatory tests","Ugandan individuals","computational neural network","specific immune responses","stronger binders","Wilcoxon","conjunction","analysis","immunogen design","lengthy process","proteome IFN-\u03B3 ELISPOT assays","rank test","area","Receiver Operator Characteristic","alleles","inverse correlation","curve","subtypes A1","benchmark","performance","AUC","BACKGROUND","immunogens","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the early stages of the disease in young adults are crucial to reduce the incidence of end-stage HOA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether (1) a relationship among the inflammatory status of labrum and synovium collected from patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) would exist; and (2) to investigate the associations among the histopathological features of joint tissues, the pre-operative symptoms and the post-operative outcomes after arthroscopic surgery. METHODS: Joint tissues from 21 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI were collected and their histological and immunohistochemical features were correlated with clinical parameters. RESULTS: Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in 25% of FAI patients, inversely correlated with the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) pain and function subscales and with the absolute and relative change in total HOOS. All the labral samples showed some pattern of degeneration and 67% of the samples showed calcium deposits. The total labral score was associated with increased CD68 positive cells in the synovium. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the chondral damage worsened the HOOS post-op symptoms (adjusted R-square = 0.76 p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a relationship between the histologic labral features, the synovial inflammation, and the cartilage condition at the time of FAI. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the cartilage damage and the synovitis negatively affects the post-operative outcomes in patients with FAI.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trisolino, Giovanni; Favero, Marta; Dallari, Dante; Tassinari, Enrico; Traina, Francesco; Otero, Miguel; Goldring, Steven R.; Goldring, Mary B.; Carubbi, Chiara; Ramonda, Roberta; Stilli, Stefano; Grigolo, Brunella; Olivotto, Eleonora","journal":"J Orthop Surg Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e01b775f979f6c0b56e6d2facdb1f8d98d059fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7049200.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7049200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FAI","HOOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FAI patients","hip disability","Hip osteoarthritis","labral samples","total labral score","total HOOS","hip arthroscopy","total hip replacement","histologic labral features","presence of labral calcifications","time of FAI","post-operative outcomes","common hip disorder","HOOS post-op symptoms","pre-operative symptoms","stage disease","synovium","histopathological features of joint tissues","immunohistochemical features","cartilage damage","stage HOA","relationship","study","osteoarthritis outcome score","synovial inflammation","incidence of end","chondral damage","cartilage condition","major cause of disability","estimated prevalence of end","Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration","adjusted R-square","pain","adult population","increased CD68 positive cells","early stages","young adults","function subscales","synovitis","relative change","inflammatory status of labrum","treatment","RESULTS","arthroscopic surgery","femoroacetabular impingement","pattern of degeneration","prevention","clinical parameters","associations","METHODS","BACKGROUND","diagnosis","calcium deposits","CONCLUSIONS","purpose"],"language":"en"},

One of the major hurdles faced when attempting to identify host factors specifically involved in viral RNA replication/transcription is how to discriminate these factors from those involved in translation. Several of the host factors shown to affect viral RNA synthesis are factors known to be involved in protein synthesis, for example, translation factors. In addition, some of the factors identified to date appear to influence viral RNA amplification as well as viral protein synthesis, and translation and replication are frequently tightly associated. Several specific host factors actively participating in viral RNA transcription/replication have been identified and the regions of host protein/replicase or host protein/viral RNA interaction have been determined. The chapter centers exclusively on those factors that appear functionally important for viral amplification. It presents a list of the viruses for which a specific host factor associates with the polymerase, affecting viral genome amplification. It also indicates the usually accepted cell function of the factor and the viral polymerase or polymerase subunit to which the host factor binds.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boguszewska\u2010Chachulska, Anna M.; Haenni, Anne\u2010Lise","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5991282db0f3b857adf01bd567a5b4651d35228.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119065.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352705650026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352705650026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA replication","specific host factors","viral polymerase","viral RNA synthesis","viral RNA amplification","viral RNA transcription","viral amplification","translation factors","viral protein synthesis","viral RNA interaction","regions of host protein","viral genome amplification","transcription of RNA viruses","polymerase subunit","chapter centers","replicase","updated view","example","Publisher Summary","accepted cell function","present","major hurdles","list","addition"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to evaluate the use of NIV in a cohort of (H1N1)v pneumonia. Usefulness and success of NIV were assessed in a prospective, observational registry of patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus pneumonia in 148 Spanish intensive care units (ICUs) in 2009\u201310. Significant variables for NIV success were included in a multivariate analysis. In all, 685 patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1)v viral pneumonia were admitted to participating ICUs; 489 were ventilated, 177 with NIV. The NIV was successful in 72 patients (40.7%), the rest required intubation. Low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, low Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and absence of renal failure were associated with NIV success. Success of NIV was independently associated with fewer than two chest X-ray quadrant opacities (OR 3.5) and no vasopressor requirement (OR 8.1). However, among patients with two or more quadrant opacities, a SOFA score \u22647 presented a higher success rate than those with SOFA score \u003E7 (OR 10.7). Patients in whom NIV was successful required shorter ventilation time, shorter ICU stay and hospital stay than NIV failure. In patients in whom NIV failed, the delay in intubation did not increase mortality (26.5% versus 24.2%). Clinicians used NIV in 25.8% of influenza A (H1N1)v viral pneumonia admitted to ICU, and treatment was effective in 40.6% of them. NIV success was associated with shorter hospital stay and mortality similar to non-ventilated patients. NIV failure was associated with a mortality similar to those who were intubated from the start.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masclans, J.

The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. RESULTS: After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (\u03B1 = .82) and test\u2013retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). CONCLUSION: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Imani, Vida; Saffari, Mohsen; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.","journal":"Int J Ment Health Addict","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53843b9d13e70819fad039e85984a21ed15f2109.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100496.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["item scale","Fear of COVID","Depression Scale","Disease Scale","allaying COVID","fears","validity properties","acceptable corrected item-total correlation","corrected item-total correlation testing","items","Hospital Anxiety","reliability values","retest reliability","robust psychometric properties","individuals","FCV","panel review","perceived infectability","Perceived Vulnerability","Concurrent validity","psychometric tests","classical test theory","extensive review of existing scales","expert evaluations","Rasch model","internal consistency","ICC","worries","participant interviews","germ aversion","sample","strong factor loadings","clinical efforts","RESULTS","spread","general population","present study","consequences","Iranian participants","METHODS","BACKGROUND","emergence","CONCLUSION","cases"],"language":"en"},

Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days. We hope our \u0022Renji experience\u0022 will be beneficial to colleagues.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Y; Zhong, M","journal":"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200217-00057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["colorectal cancer patients","management of patients","emergency patients","perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients","life-threatening patients","emergent patients","medical observation","treatment of colorectal cancer","surgical medical workers","confirmed COVID","diagnosis of colorectal tumor","clinical practice of colorectal surgery","health of medical staff","emergency surgery","separate medical devices","disposable medical items","medical waste standard","cross infection of COVID","highest quality medical services","intestinal obstruction","prevention","operative room","emergency cases","surgical instruments","human","surgical staffs","perioperative periods","protection of wards","isolated room","cause hospital infection","control measures","respiratory department","special situation","infectious department","safety of wards","Colonoscopy examination","intestinal decompressive tube","orderly clinical work","bleeding","feces","operating rooms","body fluids","difficult task","new coronary pneumonia","premise","families","experiences","front-line subject","gastrointestinal foreign bodies","routine departments","epidemic","negative pressure","surgeons","fight","Corona virus disease","procedures","epidemiology","Renji experience","Multidisciplinary team","MDT","colleagues","members","hospitals","inpatients","operation","doctors","main points","days","China","level"],"language":"en"},

Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 are identical to those as bound to the MERS-CoV-S. Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with SARS-CoV-S.

BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with WEHI-3 cells and then treated orally with TS (50 mg/kg). In vivo study showed that TS treatment reduced liver and spleen enlargement in WEHI-3 bearing mice compared with the untreated group. Furthermore, TS also decreased white blood cells (WBC), indicating inhibition of differentiation of the precursor of macrophages in WEHI-3 bearing mice. Treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS (0-75 \u03BCg/mL for 24 hours) significantly reduced cell viability. Furthermore, TS treatment\u2013induced late apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin-V/PI staining. Western blot analyses revealed that treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS statistically increased the protein expression level of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm and activates caspase-3. Notably, TS treatment caused a dramatic reduction in Bcl-2 and increase in Bax protein levels. TS may disturb the Bcl-2 and Bax protein ratio and induce apoptosis.

These changes have rekindled debates about the validity and legitimacy of global health estimates. This paper draws on country case studies and personal experience to support our opinion that the production and use of estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political and ideational contexts, which differ at different levels of the global health architecture. Broadly, most global health estimates tend to be made far from the local contexts in which the data upon which they are based are collected, and where the results of estimation processes must ultimately be used if they are to make a difference to the health of individuals. Internationally standardised indicators are necessary, but they are no substitute for data that meet local needs, and that fit with local ideas of what is credible and useful. In other words, data that are both technically and socially robust for those who make key decisions about health. We suggest that greater engagement of local actors (and local data) in the formulation, communication and interpretation of health estimates would increase the likelihood that these data will be used by those most able to translate them into health gains for the longer term. Besides strengthening national information systems, this requires ongoing interaction, building trust and establishing a communicative infrastructure. Local capacities to use knowledge to improve health must be supported.","publish_time":"2017-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pisani, Elizabeth; Kok, Maarten","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d52191db94d11ad1d56bb48ecc64656b44a613.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5124117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28532303/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v9.32298","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health gains","health of individuals","local data","comparable health estimates","interpretation of health estimates","legitimacy of global health estimates","global health architecture","local contexts","field of health estimate production","local needs","local ideas","Local capacities","greater engagement of local actors","ideational contexts","important new players","plethora of new development goals","validity","funding institutions","different levels","recent years","country case studies","personal experience","demand","communication","formulation","ongoing interaction","trust","substitute","national information systems","paper","debates","opinion","key decisions","longer term","knowledge","likelihood","results of estimation processes","standardised indicators","communicative infrastructure","changes","difference","words"],"language":"en"},

When conjugated OVA-sHsp was delivered intranasally to na\u00EFve mice, the resulting immune response to OVA was accelerated and intensified, and OVA-specific IgG1 responses were apparent within 5 days after a single immunizing dose, illustrating its utility for vaccine development. If animals were pretreated with a disparate VLP, P22 (a non-replicative bacteriophage capsid), before OVA-sHsp conjugate immunization, OVA-specific IgG1 responses were apparent already by 4 days after a single immunizing dose of conjugate in OVA-na\u00EFve mice. Additionally, the mice pretreated with P22 produced high titer mucosal IgA, and isotype-switched OVA-specific serum IgG. Similarly, sHsp pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of lung germinal center B cells, T follicular helper cells, and increased polymeric Ig receptor expression, priming the lungs for subsequent IgG and IgA responses to influenza virus challenge. Thus, sHsp nanoparticles elicited quick and intense antibody responses and these accelerated responses could similarly be induced to antigen chemically conjugated to the sHsp. Pretreatment of mice with P22 further accelerated the onset of the antibody response to OVA-sHsp, demonstrating the utility of conjugating antigens to VLPs for pre-, or possibly post-exposure prophylaxis of lung, all without the need for adjuvant.","publish_time":"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richert, Laura E.; Servid, Amy E.; Harmsen, Ann L.; Rynda-Apple, Agnieszka; Han, Soo; Wiley, James A.; Douglas, Trevor; Harmsen, Allen G.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53265940ead4d3a3a44537e0dfbd747d4e42fa3f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ab7acd1a5a78ec6d3f6cdddd26fb6f3923e3e371.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3579574.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12004112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22465748/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X12004112; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.03.035; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3579574?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OVA-sHsp conjugate immunization","sHsp cage","sHsp pretreatment","OVA-na\u00EFve mice","OVA-sHsp conjugation efficiency","OVA-specific IgG1 responses","sHsp nanoparticles","OVA-specific serum IgG","accelerated responses","IgA responses","P22","Pretreatment of mice","intense antibody responses","days","single immunizing dose of conjugate","VLPs","subsequent IgG","model antigen","accumulation of lung germinal center B cells","influenza virus challenge","utility of conjugating antigens","resulting immune response","small molecule linker","T follicular helper cells","high titer mucosal IgA","small heat shock protein","post-exposure prophylaxis of lung","lungs","increased polymeric Ig receptor expression","isotype","non-replicative bacteriophage capsid","length","stoichiometry","structural similarities","onset","disparate VLP","attachment position","exterior","ovalbumin","vaccine development","animals","need","adjuvant"],"language":"en"},

This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and associated coping styles within the general population visiting community health care services. Methods It was conducted on individuals attending community polyclinics in Singapore within the first week of July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS. The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively. Results The overall response rate was 78.0%. Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%). The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of posttraumatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24\u20134.13, P=.008]. Psychiatric morbidity was further associated with being seen at fever stations (adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08\u20133.34, P=.026), younger age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94\u20130.98, P=.021), increased self blame (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.22\u20132.28, P=.001), less substance use (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56\u20130.98, P=.034) and posttraumatic morbidity was associated with increased use of denial (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.67, P=.024), and planning (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16\u20131.95, P=.002) as coping measures.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing, including portable genomic sequencing at reduced costs and turnaround time, are paralleled by continuing developments in methodology to infer evolutionary histories (dynamics/patterns) and to identify factors driving viral spread in space and time. The traditionally static nature of visualizing phylogenetic trees that represent these evolutionary relationships/processes has also evolved, albeit perhaps at a slower rate. Advanced visualization tools with increased resolution assist in drawing conclusions from phylogenetic estimates and may even have potential to better inform public health and treatment decisions, but the design (and choice of what analyses are shown) is hindered by the complexity of information embedded within current phylogenetic models and the integration of available meta-data. In this review, we discuss visualization challenges for the interpretation and exploration of reconstructed histories of viral epidemics that arose from increasing volumes of sequence data and the wealth of additional data layers that can be integrated. We focus on solutions that address joint temporal and spatial visualization but also consider what the future may bring in terms of visualization and how this may become of value for the coming era of real-time digital pathogen surveillance, where actionable results and adequate intervention strategies need to be obtained within days.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theys, Kristof; Lemey, Philippe; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Baele, Guy","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99d730ff4e80cd42f0304b9d80d7d0df0689888d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6688121.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spatial visualization","visualization challenges","terms of visualization","phylogenetic estimates","evolutionary histories","viral spread","Advanced visualization tools","exploration of reconstructed histories of viral epidemics","portable genomic sequencing","current phylogenetic models","ongoing epidemics of viral infectious diseases","evolutionary relationships","turnaround time","increasing volumes of sequence data","integration of available meta-data","wealth of additional data layers","static nature of visualizing phylogenetic trees","high-throughput sequencing","increased resolution assist","actionable results","coming era of real-time digital pathogen surveillance","drawing conclusions","reduced costs","methodology","continuing developments","interpretation","adequate intervention strategies","design","treatment decisions","public health","factors","potential","joint temporal","patterns","dynamics","space","complexity of information","solutions","value","epidemiological monitoring","response","Advances","future","choice","analyses","processes","review","slower rate","days"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have suggested that PDCoV infection antagonizes RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated IFN-\u03B2 production to evade host innate immune defense, and PDCoV-encoded nonstructural protein nsp5 and accessory protein NS6 are associated with this process. However, whether the structural protein(s) of PDCoV also antagonize IFN-\u03B2 production remains unclear. In this study, we found that PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein, the most abundant viral structural protein, suppressed Sendai virus (SEV)-induced IFN-\u03B2 production and transcription factor IRF3 activation, but did not block IFN-\u03B2 production induced by overexpressing RIG-I/MDA5. Furthermore, study revealed that PDCoV N protein interacted with RIG-I and MDA5 in an in vitro overexpression system and evident interactions between N protein and RIG-I could be detected in the context of PDCoV infection, which interfered with the binding of dsRNA and protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT) to RIG-I. Together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV N protein is an IFN antagonist and utilizes diverse strategies to attenuate RIG-I recognition and activation.","publish_time":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jun; Fang, Puxian; Wang, Mohan; Peng, Qi; Ren, Jie; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo; Ding, Zhen","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6106daccd9dcbfbbc30e3d67a1796cd8096c44f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129785/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-019-01673-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV N protein","RIG-","protein activator of protein kinase R","PDCoV nucleocapsid","nonstructural protein nsp5","accessory protein NS6","induced IFN-\u03B2 production","context of PDCoV infection","abundant viral structural protein","mediated IFN-\u03B2 production","overexpressing RIG","IFN antagonist","MDA5","study","transcription factor IRF3 activation","suppressed Sendai virus","SEV","watery diarrhea","evident interactions","emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","host","overexpression system","PACT","immune defense","diverse strategies","binding of dsRNA","mortality","RLR","receptor","results","recognition","Previous studies","newborn piglets","Porcine deltacoronavirus","process"],"language":"en"},

It is evident from animal and imaging studies that subtle variations in the intrauterine environment can cause recognizable differences in brain structure and cognitive functions in the offspring. A wide variety of environmental factors may play a role in precipitating the emergent developmental dysregulation and the consequent evolution of psychiatric traits in early adulthood by inducing inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO\u0026NS) pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and epigenetic dysregulation. However, the precise mechanisms behind such relationships and the specificity of the risk factors for schizophrenia remain exploratory.

This review reflects on glycan\u2013lectin interactions in the context of viral infection and antiviral immunity. A short introduction illustrates the nature of glycans and lectins, and conveys the basic principles of their interactions. Subsequently, examples are discussed highlighting specific glycan\u2013lectin interactions and how they affect the progress of viral infections, either benefiting the host or the virus. Moreover, glycan and lectin variability and their potential biological consequences are discussed.

The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism. METHODS: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220 countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread of the disease. RESULTS: In order to assess the predictive power of the model, the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. CONCLUSION: The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic outbreaks.","publish_time":"2007-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colizza, Vittoria; Barrat, Alain; Barth\u00E9lemy, Marc; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c517aa1fab6a0368bd7aad5352d558f3ec60b1d2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e035002c8135dab46801a3fc8a43b87240dbef8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2213648.xml.json","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.2261v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["epidemic models","emerging epidemic pathways","empirical data","census data","demographic data","global spread of SARS","appearance of robust epidemic pathways","global spreading of emerging diseases","understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks","introduction of extensive transportation data sets","general stochastic meta-population model","likelihood of country outbreaks","order","predictive power","catastrophic outbreaks","long-range transportation networks","outbreak likelihood","general tool","specific countries","computational strategy","Simulation results","integration of long-range mobility","presented computational approach","disease parameter values","actual travel","severe acute respiratory syndrome","important step","initial conditions","case study","urban areas","probabilistic predictions","effects","analysis","agreement","probable routes","importance","definition of containment policies","CONCLUSION","magnitude","Hong Kong","METHODS","level of predictability","BACKGROUND","realism"],"language":"en"},

In this study, soluble recombinant human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) NP was produced to examine the antigenicity of the HCoV-OC43 NP of betacoronavirus. Using the purified recombinant NP as an antigen, a polyclonal antibody from rabbit serum with specificity for HCoV-OC43 NP was generated; this antibody reacts specifically with HCoV-OC43 NP and does not cross-react with other human CoV NPs (including those of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E) by Western blot. Sera from 26 young adults, 17 middle-aged and elderly patients with respiratory infection, and 15 cord blood samples were also tested. Strong reactivity to the NPs of HCoV-OC43 was observed in 96%, 82%, and 93% of the serum samples from the young adults, respiratory patients, and cord blood samples, respectively. To identify the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of the NP that are recognised by the rabbit polyclonal antibody and human serum, the antigenicities of three protein fragments, including the N-terminal domain (aa 1-173), the central-linker region (aa 174-300), and the C-terminal domain (aa 301-448), were evaluated by Western blot. The rabbit polyclonal antibody demonstrated greater immunoreactivity to the central-linker region and the C-terminal domain than to the N-terminal domain. Three different patterns for the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of HCoV-OC43 NP were observed in human serum, suggesting variability in the immune responses that occur during HCoV-OC43 infection in humans. The central-linker region of the NP appeared to be the most highly immunoreactive region for all three patterns observed. The goal of this study was to offer insight into the design of diagnostic tools for HCoV infection.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Fang-Ying; Lin, Leng-Chieh; Ying, Tsung-Ho; Yao, Chen-Wen; Tang, Tswen-Kei; Chen, Yi-Wen; Hou, Ming-Hon","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/603a35b50ca1a29944fce6fa2304f6eb13953f03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112824.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093412003898; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.11.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093412003898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23174159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43 infection","HCoV-OC43 NP of betacoronavirus","HCoV infection","NPs of HCoV","structural regions of HCoV","purified recombinant NP","human serum","soluble recombinant human coronavirus OC43","rabbit serum","serum samples","rabbit polyclonal antibody","central-linker region","N-terminal domain","C-terminal domain","respiratory infection","human CoV NPs","immunoreactive region","cord blood samples","respiratory patients","young adults","epidemiological screening of coronavirus infection","recombinant nucleocapsid protein","study","immunoreactivities","Western blot","elderly patients","protein fragments","SARS-CoV","different patterns","specificity","greater immunoreactivity","suitable reagent","design of diagnostic tools","antigenicities","insight","variability","immune responses","antigenicity","Strong reactivity","Abstract Previous studies","humans","Sera","goal"],"language":"en"},

Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1, the function of 2\u2032-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago 2-4. Here, we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2\u2032-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2\u2032-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2\u2032-O methylation of the 5\u2032 cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2\u2032-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA likely serves as a paradigm for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.","publish_time":"2010-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daffis, Stephane; Szretter, Kristy J.; Schriewer, Jill; Li, Jianqing; Youn, Soonjeon; Errett, John; Lin, Tsai-Yu; Schneller, Stewart; Zust, Roland; Dong, Hongping; Thiel, Volker; Pierson, Theodore C.; Buller, R.

In this study, we demonstrate that the IFN-antagonizing activity is specific to SARS coronavirus M protein and is mediated through its first transmembrane domain (TM1) located at the N terminus. M protein from human coronavirus HKU1 does not inhibit IFN production. Whereas N-linked glycosylation of SARS coronavirus M protein has no influence on IFN antagonism, TM1 is indispensable for the suppression of IFN production. TM1 targets SARS coronavirus M protein and heterologous proteins to the Golgi apparatus, yet Golgi localization is required but not sufficient for IFN antagonism. Mechanistically, TM1 is capable of binding with RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKK\u03B5, and preventing the interaction of TRAF3 with its downstream effectors.

We used Agilent bovine gene microarray chips containing 44,000 transcripts to elucidate bovine bronchial epithelial cell (BBEC) responses following in vitro exposure to BHV-1 alone, M. haemolytica alone, or both BHV-1 and M. haemolytica. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (\u003E2-fold) of 978 transcripts by BHV-1 alone, 2040 transcripts by M. haemolytica alone, and 2189 genes by BHV-1 and M. haemolytica in combination. M. haemolytica treatment produced significantly greater inductions (\u003E10-fold) of several inflammation associated genes, such as CXCL2, IL-6, IL-1\u03B1, e-selectin, and IL-8, than to BHV-1 alone. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in important biological processes such as inflammation (TNF-\u03B1, IL-8, Tlr-2, IL-1, CXCL2, CSF2), vascular functions (VEGF, EDN2) and leukocyte migration (ICAM1, IL-16) during a co-infection with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica compared to either pathogen alone.

Objectives To study seroconversion and the magnitude of IgG responses in a SARS cohort with different disease severities. Study design and method A retrospective analysis of all acute and convalescent-phase sera collected from a cohort of laboratory-confirmed SARS cases. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody was detected using indirect immunofluorescence technique and quantified by two-fold serial dilutions. Characteristics of patients who seroconverted \u201Cearly\u201D (\u003Cmedian interval) were compared to those documented to remain sero-negative during the same time interval. Median IgG levels in convalescent-phase sera (collected within 30 days) were compared among patients with different disease severities. Correlations between IgG levels and important laboratory parameters were assessed. Results A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed SARS cases were analyzed; of which 301 (92.6%) had anti-SARS-CoV IgG detected in their sera at the time of sampling. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness; seroconversion occurred at a median of 16 days (range 4\u201335 days), and IgG peak levels were reached in the fourth week. Early seroconversion (\u003Cday 16) occurred more frequently among patients who required ICU-admission (\u03C7 2; p =0.011). Higher IgG levels were detected in patients who required supplemental oxygen (Mann\u2013Whitney; p =0.002), ICU-admission (p =0.001), had negative pre-discharge fecal RT-PCR results (p =0.004), and lymphopenia at presentation (p =0.028).

However, the transcriptional regulation of these genes, especially whether there exist any enhancers and their roles during the IFN induction process remain elusive. Here, through public data mining, episomal luciferase reporter assay and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we identified an IFN-responsive enhancer located 35 kb upstream of IFITM3 gene promoter upregulating the IFN-induced expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 bound to the enhancer with the treatment of IFN and was indispensable for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, using chromosome conformation capture technique, we revealed that the IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes physically clustered together and constitutively looped to the distal enhancer through long-range interactions in both HEK293 and A549 cells, providing structural basis for coordinated regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the enhancer. Finally, we showed that in vivo truncation of the enhancer impaired IFN-induced resistance to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression and its ability to mediate IFN signaling.","publish_time":"2017-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ping; Shi, Ming-Lei; Shen, Wen-Long; Zhang, Zhang; Xie, De-Jian; Zhang, Xiang-Yuan; He, Chao; Zhang, Yan; Zhao, Zhi-Hu","journal":"Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d68f39c881d1617b562bcf67cfa42cc442615c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102783.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2017.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28511927/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874939917300299; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874939917300299","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-responsive enhancer","IFN-induced expression of IFITM1","treatment of IFN","genes","enhancer impaired IFN-induced resistance","distal enhancer","enhancer activity","IFN induction process","transcriptional regulation of IFITM1","coordinated regulation of IFITM1","episomal luciferase reporter assay","electrophoretic mobility shift assay","transmembrane proteins","family of interferon","influenza","EMSA","structural basis","signal transducers","A549 cells","ChIP","HEK293","public data mining","long-range interactions","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing","entry","virus","mechanisms","activators of transcription","IFITM3 gene promoter","IAV","STAT","roles","Chromatin immunoprecipitation","broad spectrum of pathogens","chromosome conformation capture technique","infection","understanding","truncation","findings","enhancers","ability"],"language":"en"},

We studied the dispersion of exhaled air through a simple oxygen mask applied to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of different oxygen flow in a room free of air currents. Methods The HPS represented a 70-kg adult male individual in a semi-sitting position on a hospital bed inclined at 45\u00B0. A simple oxygen mask was fitted to the HPS in the normal fashion. The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. The HPS was programmed to breathe at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light-sheet, and images were captured by high-resolution video. Smoke concentration in the exhaled plume was estimated from the total light intensity scattered by smoke particles. Findings A jet plume of air leaked through the side vents of the simple oxygen mask to lateral distances of 0.2, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.4 m from the sagittal plane during the delivery of oxygen at 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min, respectively. Coughing could extend the dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m. Conclusion Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs generally within 0.4 m from patients receiving supplemental oxygen via a simple mask.

The objective of the present study is to further investigate the wind induced inter-flat pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings in Shanghai. In this paper, a set of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 reduced scale model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was employed as a tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. Two natural ventilation modes, single-sided ventilation and cross ventilation were considered. The conditions under prevailing wind direction with different source locations on the windward side were compared. The pressure coefficients on all of the building fa\u00E7ades and tracer gas concentration distributions were monitored and analysed. The experimental results elucidated that contaminant released from windward units could spread vertically and horizontally to other units on the source fa\u00E7ade and downstream units. The source location was a significant influence factor on the pollutant concentration in various units.

Our objective was to determine whether sampling with a throat swab provides incremental benefit\u2014when used in conjunction with a nasal swab\u2014to detect respiratory viruses among patients with acute pharyngitis in the outpatient setting. FINDINGS: Among 83 university students with acute pharyngitis, we detected respiratory viruses with molecular assays on two samples collected per student: with a flocked nasal mid-turbinate swab and a rayon throat swab. Forty-eight (58 %) patients had virus-positive samples, with 49 virus positives detected by either swab (one patient had a dual viral co-infection). The most common viruses were rhinovirus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. Specifically, 29 virus positives were detected by both swabs, 14 exclusively by the nasal swab, and six exclusively by the throat swab. The additional six virus positives detected by the throat swab corresponded to an absolute increase in viral detection of 7.1 % (95 % CI: 1.2\u201312.9 %); the specific viruses detected were four rhinoviruses and two coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The flocked nasal swab samples respiratory viruses well, even among patients whose primary complaint is a sore throat. The rayon throat swab has modest incremental value over and above using the flocked nasal mid-turbinate swab alone, which suggests that while throat swabs alone would not be adequate for respiratory viral surveillance, they may have value as a supplementary test.","publish_time":"2015-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Mohsin; Han, Sangsu; Gunst, Chris J.; Lim, Steve; Luinstra, Kathy; Smieja, Marek","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67c9acbf8204919fe540d58d7db296b9210f1e90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4625558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511714/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0408-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rayon throat swab","flocked nasal swab samples respiratory viruses","throat swabs","flocked nasal mid-turbinate swab","nasal swabs","specific viruses","sore throat","virus positives","Detection of specific respiratory viruses","common viruses","respiratory viral surveillance","patients","virus-positive samples","viral detection","acute pharyngitis","modest incremental value","surveillance programs","incremental benefit","dual viral co-infection","absolute increase","molecular assays","university students","primary complaint","conjunction","sampling","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","outpatient setting","influenza","rhinoviruses","FINDINGS","supplementary test","coronaviruses","objective"],"language":"en"},

However, the molecular mechanisms for the low IFN production in cells infected with coronaviruses remain unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of MHV-A59, can bind to IRF3, cause its deubiquitination and prevent its nuclear translocation. As a consequence, co-expression of PLP2 strongly inhibits CARDIF-, TBK1- and IRF3-mediated IFN\u03B2 reporter activities. In addition, we show that wild-type PLP2 but not the mutant PLP2 lacking the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity can reduce IFN induction and promote viral growth in cells infected with VSV.

Maternal vaccines that can induce lactogenic immunity to protect suckling piglets via colostrums and milk are pivotal for the prevention and control of PEDV infection in neonatal suckling piglets. In this study, a group of pregnant sows were first orally immunized with coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres and boosted with killed PEDV vaccines (heterologous prime\u2010boost). It has been detected that the levels of PEDV\u2010specific antibodies (IgG and IgA) in their sera and milks were higher than other negative groups (P \u003C 0\u00B7001 or P \u003C 0\u00B705). Furthermore, it has been proved by the neutralization assay that the induced antibodies could significantly inhibit virus infection as compared to other negative groups (P \u003C 0\u00B701 or P \u003C 0\u00B705). Importantly, after PEDV challenge, more than 90% of the suckling piglets delivered by the sows in the heterologous prime\u2010boost group were completely protected. Overall, the results show that \u2018heterologous prime\u2010boost\u2019 form is an efficient and effective way to provide protection for suckling piglets against PEDV through lactogenic immunity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: As a widespread swine pathogen, PEDV affects the swine industry enormously. It causes enteritis in swine of all ages and is often fatal in neonatal piglets. Our data show that pregnant sows were immunized with \u2018coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres \u002B killed PEDV vaccines\u2019 (heterologous prime\u2010boost immunization) could protect more than 90% suckling piglets delivered by the sows against the virus.

The aim of this study was to identify the perceived barriers to veterinary infection control and HeV management in private veterinary practice in Queensland, where the majority of HeV outbreaks have occurred in Australia. RESULTS: Most participants agreed that a number of key factors had contributed to the slow uptake of adequate infection control measures for the management of HeV amongst private veterinarians: a work culture characterised by suboptimal infection control standards and misconceptions about zoonotic risks; a lack of leadership and support from government authorities; the difficulties of managing biosecurity and public health issues from a private workforce perspective; and the slow pattern of emergence of HeV. By 2010, some infection control and HeV management changes had been implemented. Participants interviewed agreed that further improvements remained necessary; but also cautioned that this was a complex process which would require time. CONCLUSION: Private veterinarians and government authorities prior to 2009 were unprepared to handle new slowly emerging zoonoses, which may explain their mismanagement of HeV. Slowly emerging zoonoses may be of low public health significance but of high significance for specialised groups such as veterinarians. Private veterinarians, who are expected to fulfil an active biosecurity and public health role in the frontline management of such emerging zoonoses, need government agencies to better recognise their contribution, to consult with the veterinary profession when devising guidelines for the management of zoonoses and to provide them with greater leadership and support. We propose that specific infection control guidelines for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses in private veterinary settings need to be developed.","publish_time":"2014-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendez, Diana H; Kelly, Jenny; Buttner, Petra; Nowak, Madeleine; Speare, Rick","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/468c549a9b35a3f23be71f098c3ab910abadac8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4173005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25224910/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0215-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Queensland","Australia"],"keyphrases":["Veterinary infection control","management of zoonoses","HeV management changes","emerging zoonoses","private veterinarians","mismanagement of HeV","private veterinary practice","private veterinary settings","frontline management","suboptimal infection control standards","specific infection control guidelines","veterinary personnel","veterinary profession","majority of HeV outbreaks","management of Hendra virus","emerging zoonosis","slow uptake of adequate infection control measures","private workforce perspective","government authorities","public health issues","public health role","low public health significance","government agencies","support","Australia","participants","high significance","lack of leadership","active biosecurity","greater leadership","slow pattern of emergence","misconceptions","work culture","zoonotic risks","difficulties","Queensland","perceived barriers","specialised groups","CONCLUSION","number of key factors","study","contribution","humans","BACKGROUND","complex process","time","improvements","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Airborne transmission is a vital route of disease infection caused by bacteria and virus. However, tracing methods of airborne bacteria in both lab and field research failed to veritably express the transporting process of microorganism in the air. A new tracing method of airborne bacteria used for airborne transmission was put forward and demonstrated its feasibility by conducting a field evaluation on the basis of genetic modification and bioaerosol technology. A specific gene fragment (pFPV-mCherry fluorescent protein plasmid) was introduced into nonpathogenic E. coli DH5\u03B1 as tracer bacteria by high-voltage electroporation. Gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing proved the success of the synthesis. Genetic stability, effect of aerosolization on the survival rate of tracer bacteria, and the application of the tracer bacteria to the airborne bacteria transmission were examined in both lab and field. Both the introduced plasmid stability rates of tracer E. coli in pre-aerosolization and post-aerosolization were above 95% in five test days. Survival rate of tracer E. coli at 97.5% \u00B1 1.2% through aerosolization was obtained by an air-atomizer operated at an air pressure of 30 Psi. In the field experiment, the airborne transmission of E. coli between poultry houses was proved and emitted E. coli was more easily transmitted into self-house than adjacent house due to the ventilation design and weather condition. Our results suggested that the tracing method of airborne bacteria was available for the investigation of airborne microbial transmission across built environments.","publish_time":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zonggang; Wang, Hongning; Zheng, Weichao; Li, Baoming; Wei, Yongxiang; Zeng, Jinxin; Lei, Changwei","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f11627f97aeca9567a6c169ef7cad45a25b92ed0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106335; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132319305451; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132319305451","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airborne bacteria transmission","airborne transmission of","tracing methods of airborne bacteria","new tracing method of airborne bacteria","survival rate of tracer bacteria","investigation of airborne microbial transmission","coli DH5\u03B1","Abstract Disease transmission","pre-aerosolization","effect of aerosolization","post-aerosolization","field evaluation","field research","field experiment","introduced plasmid stability rates of tracer","Genetic stability","built environments","lab","air pressure","air-atomizer","adjacent house","self-house","basis of genetic modification","vital route of disease infection","pFPV-mCherry fluorescent protein plasmid","specific gene fragment","ventilation design","poultry houses","DNA sequencing","high-voltage electroporation","success","bioaerosol technology","application","Gel electrophoresis","transporting process of microorganism","weather condition","virus","serious health risk","synthesis","Psi","feasibility","results","test days"],"language":"en"},

In vitro, ectopic expression of transcription factors, in particular CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03B1) and C/EBP\u03B2, can convert B cells into functional macrophages. However, little is known about the specific ligands responsible for such phenotype conversion. Here, we investigated whether spike protein of SARS-CoV can act as a ligand to trigger the conversion of B cells to macrophages. We transduced SARS-CoV spike protein-displayed recombinant baculovirus (SSDRB), vAtEpGS688, into peripheral B cells and B lymphoma cells. Cell surface expression of CD19 or Mac-1 (CD11b) was determined by flow cytometry. SSDRB-mediated changes in gene expression profiles of B lymphoma cells were analyzed by microarray. In this report, we showed that spike protein of SARS virus could induce phenotypic conversion of human B cells, either from peripheral blood or B lymphoma cells, to macrophage-like cells that were steadily losing the B-cell marker CD19 and in turn expressing the macrophage-specific marker Mac-1. Furthermore, we found that SSDRB enhanced the expression of CD86, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03B1 (HIF1\u03B1), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS or STAT-induced STAT inhibitor)-3, C/EBP\u03B2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), Kr\u00FCpple-like factor (KLF)-5, and CD54, without marked influence on C/EBP\u03B1 or PU.1 expression in transduced cells. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia could also induce macrophage-like conversion of B cells. These macrophage-like cells were defective in phagocytosis of red fluorescent beads. In conclusion, our results suggest that conversion of B cells to macrophage-like cells, similar to a pathophysiological response, could be mediated by a devastating viral ligand, in particular spike protein of SARS virus, or in combination with severe local hypoxia, which is a condition often observed in afflicted lungs of SARS patients.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Shu-Fen; Lin, Tze-Yi; Chow, Kuan-Chih; Chiou, Shiow-Her","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69a8322e73bf8be8b3cdda04dca292797fba7713.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112600.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2010.06.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589010004992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667598/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589010004992","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conversion of B cells","peripheral B cells","transduced cells","phenotypic conversion of human B cells","gene expression profiles of B lymphoma cells","SARS-CoV spike protein","particular spike protein of SARS virus","B-cell marker CD19","growth factor-binding protein","expression of CD86","afflicted lungs of SARS patients","phenotype conversion","macrophage-specific marker Mac","enhancer-binding protein alpha","Cell surface expression of CD19","hypoxia-inducible factor","EBP\u03B1","ectopic expression of transcription factors","severe local hypoxia","afflicted lungs of patients","EBP\u03B2","SSDRB-mediated changes","functional macrophages","particular CCAAT","peripheral blood","STAT-induced STAT inhibitor","Abstract Massive aggregations of macrophages","devastating viral ligand","specific ligands responsible","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","SOCS","turn","recombinant baculovirus","vAtEpGS688","PU","HIF1\u03B1","insulin","combination","IGFBP3","phagocytosis of red fluorescent beads","suppressor of cytokine","CD11b","influence","condition","Kr\u00FCpple","results","KLF","CD54","pathophysiological response","infection","microarray","Prolonged exposure","flow cytometry","conclusion","report"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of DNA encoding H5 as a priming vaccine to improve antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccination. METHODS: In VRC 306 and VRC 310, two sequentially enrolled phase 1, open-label, randomised clinical trials, healthy adults (age 18\u201360 years) were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular H5 DNA (4 mg) at day 0 or twice, at day 0 and week 4, followed by H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV; 90 \u03BCg) at 4 or 24 weeks, and compared with a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV with either a 4 or 24 week interval. Antibody responses were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), ELISA, neutralisation (ID(80)), and immunoassays for stem-directed antibodies. T cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. After enrolment, investigators and individuals were not masked to group assignment. VRC 306 and VRC 310 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00776711 and NCT01086657, respectively. FINDINGS: In VRC 306, 60 individuals were randomly assigned to the four groups (15 in each) and 59 received the vaccinations. In VRC 310, of the 21 individuals enrolled, 20 received the vaccinations (nine received a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV and 11 received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by H5N1 MIV at week 24). H5 DNA priming was safe and enhanced H5-specific antibody titres following an H5N1 MIV boost, especially when the interval between DNA prime and MIV boost was extended to 24 weeks. In the two studies, DNA priming with a 24-week MIV boost interval induced protective HAI titres in 21 (81%) of 26 of individuals, with an increase in geometric mean titre (GMT) of more than four times that of individuals given the MIV-MIV regimen at 4 or 24 weeks (GMT 103\u2013206 vs GMT 27\u201333). Additionally, neutralising antibodies directed to the conserved stem region of H5 were induced by this prime-boost regimen in several individuals. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. INTERPRETATION: DNA priming 24 weeks in advance of influenza vaccine boosting increased the magnitude of protective antibody responses (HAI) and in some cases induced haemagglutinin-stem-specific neutralising antibodies. A DNA-MIV vaccine regimen could enhance the efficacy of H5 or other influenza vaccines and shows that anti-stem antibodies can be elicited by vaccination in man.

In this observational study, we systematically applied currently approved diagnostic techniques in patients hospitalized for CAP in order to determine the proportion in which an etiological agent could be identified. METHODS: All patients admitted with findings consistent with CAP were included. Sputum and blood cultures, urine tests for pneumococcal and Legionella antigens, nasopharyngeal swab for viral PCR, and serum procalcitonin were obtained in nearly every case. Admission-related electronic medical records were reviewed in entirety. RESULTS: By final clinical diagnosis, 44 patients (17.0%) were uninfected. A causative bacterium was identified in only 60 (23.2%) cases. PCR identified a respiratory virus in 42 (16.2%), 12 with documented bacterial coinfection. In 119 (45.9%), no cause for CAP was found; 69 (26.6%) of these had a syndrome indistinguishable from bacterial pneumonia. Procalcitonin was elevated in patients with bacterial infection and low in uninfected patients or those with viral infection, but with substantial overlap. CONCLUSIONS: Only 23.2% of 259 patients admitted with a CAP syndrome had documented bacterial infection; another 26.6% had no identified bacterial etiology, but findings closely resembled those of bacterial infection. Nevertheless, all 259 received antibacterial therapy. Careful attention to the clinical picture may identify uninfected patients or those with viral infection, perhaps with reassurance by a non-elevated procalcitonin. Determining an etiologic diagnosis remains elusive. Better discriminators of bacterial infection are sorely needed.","publish_time":"2013-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Musher, Daniel M.; Roig, Ingrid L.; Cazares, Guillermo; Stager, Charles E.; Logan, Nancy; Safar, Hossam","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d394e825009262165e2dbbdfd7f0c82936cd13f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132393.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445313000595; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445313000595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523447/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2013.03.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["uninfected patients","viral infection","bacterial pneumonia","identified bacterial etiology","Better discriminators of bacterial infection","CAP syndrome","documented bacterial coinfection","viral PCR","serum procalcitonin","non-elevated procalcitonin","final clinical diagnosis","clinical picture","findings consistent","syndrome indistinguishable","etiologic diagnosis","cause of community","Legionella antigens","urine tests","nasopharyngeal swab","blood cultures","reassurance","Admission-related electronic medical records","Sputum","proportion","approved diagnostic techniques","entirety","Careful attention","RESULTS","substantial overlap","order","etiological agent","respiratory virus","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","observational study","causative bacterium","antibacterial therapy","cases","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Attempts to identify the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV have focused in part on dromedaries. Bats are also suspected to be reservoirs based on frequent detection of other betacoronaviruses in these mammals. For this study, ten distinct cell lines derived from bats of divergent species were exposed to MERS-CoV. Plaque assays, immunofluorescence assays, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that six bat cell lines can be productively infected. We found that the susceptibility or resistance of these bat cell lines directly correlates with the presence or absence of cell surface-expressed CD26/DPP4, the functional human receptor for MERS-CoV. Human anti-CD26/DPP4 antibodies inhibited infection of susceptible bat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 receptor conferred MERS-CoV susceptibility to resistant bat cell lines. Finally, sequential passage of MERS-CoV in permissive bat cells established persistent infection with concomitant downregulation of CD26/DPP4 surface expression. Together, these results imply that bats indeed could be among the MERS-CoV host spectrum, and that cellular restriction of MERS-CoV is determined by CD26/DPP4 expression rather than by downstream restriction factors.","publish_time":"2014-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ca\u00EC, Y\u00EDngy\u00FAn; Y\u00FA, Shu\u01D0q\u00ECng; Postnikova, Elena N.; Mazur, Steven; Bernbaum, John G.; Burk, Robin; Zh\u0101ng, T\u00E9ngf\u0113i; Radoshitzky, Sheli R.; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Jordan, Ingo; Bollinger, Laura; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Kuhn, Jens H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7a80f6f56131be32a661d7604b38c6a893ded50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4237331.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25409519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Western Asia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV susceptibility","MERS-CoV host spectrum","resistant bat cell lines","cellular restriction of MERS","natural reservoirs of MERS","DPP4 receptor","DPP4 expression","distinct cell lines","sequential passage of MERS","DPP4 antibodies","DPP4 surface expression","Human anti-CD26","Overexpression of human CD26","permissive bat cells","absence of cell surface","infection of susceptible bat cells","concomitant downregulation of CD26","functional human receptor","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","bats of divergent species","persistent infection","immunofluorescence assays","Plaque assays","downstream restriction factors","Western Asia","fatal disease","transmission electron microscopy","etiologic agent","presence","dose-dependent manner","isolated betacoronavirus","resistance","frequent detection","betacoronaviruses","study","mammals","results","dromedaries"],"language":"en"},

Etiological determination during outbreaks generally relies on clinical information, occasionally accompanied by traditional laboratory molecular or serological testing. Often, this limited testing leads to inconclusive findings. The Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) collected 12,865 nasopharyngeal specimens from acute influenza-like illness (ILI) patients in five countries in South/South East Asia during 2010\u20132013. Three hundred and twenty-four samples which were found to be negative for influenza virus after screening with real-time RT-PCR and cell-based culture techniques demonstrated the potential for viral infection with evident cytopathic effect (CPE) in several cell lines. Objective To assess whether whole genome next-generation sequencing (WG-NGS) together with conventional molecular assays can be used to reveal the etiology of influenza negative, but CPE positive specimens. Study design The supernatant of these CPE positive cell cultures were grouped in 32 pools containing 2\u201326 supernatants per pool. Three WG-NGS runs were performed on these supernatant pools. Sequence reads were used to identify positive pools containing viral pathogens. Individual samples in the positive pools were confirmed by qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, PCR and Sanger sequencing from the CPE culture and original clinical specimens. Results WG-NGS was an effective way to expand pathogen identification in surveillance studies. This enabled the identification of a viral agent in 71.3% (231/324) of unidentified surveillance samples, including common respiratory pathogens (100/324; 30.9%): enterovirus (16/100; 16.0%), coxsackievirus (31/100; 31.0%), echovirus (22/100; 22.0%), human rhinovirus (3/100; 3%), enterovirus genus (2/100; 2.0%), influenza A (9/100; 9.0%), influenza B, (5/100; 5.0%), human parainfluenza (4/100; 4.0%), human adenovirus (3/100; 3.0%), human coronavirus (1/100; 1.0%), human metapneumovirus (2/100; 2.0%), and mumps virus (2/100; 2.0%), in addition to the non-respiratory pathogen herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (172/324; 53.1%) and HSV-1 co-infection with respiratory viruses (41/324; 12.7%).","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rutvisuttinunt, Wiriya; Klungthong, Chonticha; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya; Chinnawirotpisan, Piyawan; Ajariyakhajorn, Chuanpis; Manasatienkij, Wudtichai; Phonpakobsin, Thipwipha; Lon, Chanthap; Saunders, David; Wangchuk, Sonam; Shrestha, Sanjaya K.; Velasco, John Mark S.; Alera, Maria Theresa P.; Simasathien, Sriluck; Buddhari, Darunee; Jarman, Richard G.; Macareo, Louis R; Yoon, In-Kyu; Fernandez, Stefan","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2033bc278a4005808e5338b3a0ffbdfdb92411b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28779659/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217302007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217302007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["The Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences","CPE"],"locations":["South/South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["positive pools","influenza virus","CPE positive specimens","CPE culture","CPE positive cell cultures","viral pathogens","supernatant pools","acute influenza","influenza B","human rhinovirus","human parainfluenza","human adenovirus","human coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","common respiratory pathogens","etiology of influenza negative","qRT-PCR","respiratory viruses","viral infection","real-time RT-PCR","WG-NGS runs","Results WG-NGS","pathogen identification","nasopharyngeal specimens","original clinical specimens","cell lines","HSV","viral agent","unidentified surveillance samples","mumps virus","Individual samples","non-respiratory pathogen herpes simplex virus type","cell-based culture techniques","Sanger sequencing","co-infection","generation sequencing","clinical information","surveillance studies","serological testing","limited testing","enterovirus genus","traditional laboratory molecular","South East Asia","conventional molecular assays","potential","AFRIMS","countries","Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences","evident cytopathic effect","effective way","ILI","increasing threat","illness","screening","outbreaks","patients","genome","addition","Abstract Background Emerging","public health","inconclusive findings","Etiological determination","Sequence reads","supernatants","Study","Objective","coxsackievirus","echovirus"],"language":"en"},

Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide enforce disaster risk management, even when no outbreaks are imminent. Quarantine and ventilation functions should be taken into consideration in architectural design of hospitals and healthcare facilities. We also recommend that health authorities invest in training healthcare workers for disease outbreak response, as their preparedness is essential to reducing disaster risk.","publish_time":"2017-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajakaruna, Sanjeewa Jayachandra; Liu, Wen-Bin; Ding, Yi-Bo; Cao, Guang-Wen","journal":"Mil Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39e643e0263bee019519c0c51f4ae17f1fe1a0a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5659033.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29502517/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-017-0142-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Asia","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["healthcare systems","affected healthcare facilities","outbreaks of SARS","hospital management","outbreaks of Ebola","training healthcare workers","MERS","control of HAIs","Asia","technology","disaster risk management","West Africa","effectiveness of infection prevention","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","health authorities","infection preventions","public health infrastructure","architectural design of hospitals","poor strategies","inadequate technologies","human resources","developing countries","disease outbreak response","preparedness","consideration","serious problems","increased morbidity","mortality","infections","unnecessary costs","ventilation functions","governments","results","Published literature","Quarantine","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines. Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease. PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect health care workers. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room. Importantly, PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19. Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available. Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases. Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Until further information is available, PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matava, Clyde T.; Kovatsis, Pete G.; Summers, Jennifer Lee; Castro, Pilar; Denning, Simon; Yu, Julie; Lockman, Justin L.; Von Ungern-Sternberg, Britta; Sabato, Stefano; Lee, Lisa K.; Ayad, Ihab; Mireles, Sam; Lardner, David; Whyte, Simon; Szolnoki, Judit; Jagannathan, Narasimhan; Thompson, Nicole; Stein, Mary Lyn; Dalesio, Nicholas; Greenberg, Robert; McCloskey, John; Peyton, James; Evans, Faye; Haydar, Bishr; Reynolds, Paul; Chiao, Franklin; Taicher, Brad; Templeton, Thomas; Bhalla, Tarun; Raman, Vidya T.; Garcia-Marcinkiewicz, Annery; G\u00E1lvez, Jorge; Tan, Jonathan; Rehman, Mohamed; Crockett, Christy; Olomu, Patrick; Szmuk, Peter; Glover, Chris; Matuszczak, Maria; Galvez, Ignacio; Hunyady, Agnes; Polaner, David; Gooden, Cheryl; Hsu, Grace; Gumaney, Harshad; P\u00E9rez-Pradilla, Caroline; Kiss, Edgar E.; Theroux, Mary C.; Lau, Jennifer; Asaf, Saeedah; Ingelmo, Pablo; Engelhardt, Thomas; Herv\u00EDas, M\u00F3nica; Greenwood, Eric; Javia, Luv; Disma, Nicola; Yaster, Myron; Fiadjoe, John E.","journal":"Anesth Analg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef2cb5e71a210aec8bd8dba3c7b47583705b36c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173403.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287142/; https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004872","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Society for Pediatric Anesthesia","Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PeDI-C","Airway procedures","medical procedures","Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society","airway management","Coronavirus Disease","number of clinicians","evidence-based guidelines","safety of health care workers","tracheal intubation","Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative","generated consensus guidelines","contagious disease","medical systems","asymptomatic children","undiagnosed asymptomatic patients","pandemic","Rapid spread of COVID","operating room cleaning","suspected children","severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus","cuffed tracheal tubes","aerosolized respiratory secretions","intravenous anesthetic inductions","video laryngoscopes","administering anxiolytic medications","air filtration","virtual modified nominal group technique","anesthesiologists","expert opinion","appropriate personal protective equipment","workflow","countries","addition","surgical cases","early data","overarching goals","Recommendations","negative pressure rooms","unforeseen levels","rigorous study designs","line suction catheters","Research","hospitals","contact","safe practices","information","Adequate time"],"language":"en"},

Further, they were in close agreement with the analytical airborne particle removal efficiencies, at a similar range of flow rates. These flow rates also correspond to the breathing rates of standing and walking adults. More importantly, the breathing resistance could be reduced by more than 50% for flow rates of \u223C200 L/min. Using manganese (IV) oxide coated mesh, the ozone concentration in the air outflow was reduced to less than 0.1 ppm, at a flow rate of \u223C20 L/min, thus enabling safe use.

Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19. Interview data were analyzed by category analysis from the perspective of the existence, relatedness, and growth theory (ERG). Results The existence needs were mainly reflected in health and security needs, whereas the relatedness needs consisting mainly of interpersonal needs, humanistic concern needs, and family needs; further, the growth needs were mainly reflected as a strong need for knowledge. Existence needs were the main needs during the epidemic, with health and security needs influencing each other. Humanistic concern needs were the most important of the relatedness needs; interpersonal and family needs were also growing. Conclusion It is found that the existence, relatedness, and growth needs coexist in clinical nurses. It is helpful to take effective interventions to meet their needs if the needs of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients could be perceived well.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Xue; Zeng, Lingdan","journal":"Int J Nurs Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bd083df3925b3fd74e62cb258f90c0e20a15c21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128423.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352013220300508; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352013220300508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292633/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2020.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relatedness needs","existence needs","growth needs","interpersonal needs","family needs","security needs","main needs","psychological needs of nurses","humanistic concern needs","patients","COVID","clinical nurses","growth theory","health","effective interventions","corresponding interventions","epidemic","category analysis","study","perspective","coronavirus disease","Interview data","ERG","Methods In-depth interviews","strong need","knowledge","Abstract Objective","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats and their persistence in white blood cells (WBC) and other tissues when neutralising antibodies are simultaneously present, suggest that parvovirus may persist long-term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs. The aim of this study was to screen a population of 54 cats from Sardinia (Italy) for the presence of both FPV and CPV DNA within buffy coat samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA viral load, genetic diversity, phylogeny and antibody titres against parvoviruses were investigated in the positive cats. RESULTS: Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 DNA was detected in nine cats (16.7%). Viral DNA was reassembled to FPV in four cats and to CPV (CPV-2b and 2c) in four cats; one subject showed an unusually high genetic complexity with mixed infection involving FPV and CPV-2c. Antibodies against parvovirus were detected in all subjects which tested positive to DNA parvoviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of FPV and CPV DNA in the WBC of asymptomatic cats, despite the presence of specific antibodies against parvoviruses, and the high genetic heterogeneity detected in one sample, confirmed the relevant epidemiological role of cats in parvovirus infection.","publish_time":"2018-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balboni, Andrea; Bassi, Francesca; De Arcangeli, Stefano; Zobba, Rosanna; Dedola, Carla; Alberti, Alberto; Battilani, Mara","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/300684bd7c47e1f3e8373cb250c6ad82a359955d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5799907.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1356-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29402272/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPV","CPV","Carnivore"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPV DNA","positive cats","healthy cats","DNA parvoviruses","CPV variants","WBC of asymptomatic cats","tissues of cats post-infection","Viral DNA","identification of FPV","Detection of FPV","parvovirus infection","relevant epidemiological role of cats","DNA viral load","canine parvovirus","genetic diversity","high genetic complexity","high genetic heterogeneity","mixed infection","presence of specific antibodies","buffy coat samples","phylogeny","polymerase chain reaction","feline panleukopenia virus","persistence","white blood cells","antibody titres","PCR","Sardinia","clinical signs","subjects","RESULTS","Carnivore protoparvovirus","population","BACKGROUND","Italy","study","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

Despite recent success in improving anti\u2010HCV therapy, additional progress is still needed to develop cheaper and interferon (IFN)\u2010free treatments. Here, we report that ferroquine (FQ), an antimalarial ferrocenic analog of chloroquine, is a novel inhibitor of HCV. FQ potently inhibited HCV infection of hepatoma cell lines by affecting an early step of the viral life cycle. The antiviral activity of FQ on HCV entry was confirmed with pseudoparticles expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 from six different genotypes. In addition to its effect on HCV entry, FQ also inhibited HCV RNA replication, albeit at a higher concentration. We also showed that FQ has no effect on viral assembly and virion secretion. Using a binding assay at 4\u00B0C, we showed that FQ does not prevent attachment of the virus to the cell surface. Furthermore, virus internalization was not affected by FQ, whereas the fusion process was impaired in the presence of FQ as shown in a cell\u2010cell fusion assay. Finally, virus with resistance to FQ was selected by sequential passage in the presence of the drug, and resistance was shown to be conferred by a single mutation in E1 glycoprotein (S327A). By inhibiting cell\u2010free virus transmission using a neutralizing antibody, we also showed that FQ inhibits HCV cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread between neighboring cells. Combinations of FQ with IFN, or an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease, also resulted in additive to synergistic activity. Conclusion: FQ is a novel, interesting anti\u2010HCV molecule that could be used in combination with other direct\u2010acting antivirals.

Humans are the main reservoir of the virus, but it also infects pigs and dogs. Very recently, influenza C-like viruses were isolated from pigs and cattle that differ from classical influenza C virus and might constitute a new influenza virus genus. Influenza C virus is unique since it contains only one spike protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein HEF that possesses receptor binding, receptor destroying and membrane fusion activities, thus combining the functions of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A and B viruses. Here we briefly review the epidemiology and pathology of the virus and the morphology of virus particles and their genome. The main focus is on the structure of the HEF protein as well as on its co- and post-translational modification, such as N-glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, S-acylation and proteolytic cleavage into HEF1 and HEF2 subunits. Finally, we describe the functions of HEF: receptor binding, esterase activity and membrane fusion.

Human ecology is undergoing rapid transition. This encompasses urbanization, rising consumerism, changes in working conditions, population aging, marked increases in mobility, changes in culture and behavior, evolving health-care technologies, and other factors. Global climate change is becoming a further, and major, large-scale influence on the pattern of infectious disease transmission. It is likely to become increasingly important over at least the next halfcentury, as the massive, highinertial, and somewhat unpredictable process of climate change continues. The many ways in which climate change does and will influence infectious diseases are subject to a plethora of modifying influences by other factors and processes: constitutional characteristics of hosts, vectors and pathogens; the prevailing ambient conditions; and coexistent changes in other social, economic, behavioral, and environmental factors.

Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ED on the rate of precautionary testing, antibiotic use and ED length of visit. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2009, issue 1) which contains the ARI Group\u0027s Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 3 2009), EMBASE (1988 to Week 16, 2009), MEDLINE In\u2010Process \u0026 Other Non\u2010Indexed Citations (April 27, 2009), HealthStar (1966 to 2009), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 2009), CAB Abstracts (1973 to 2007), CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007), and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality and extract data. Missing data were obtained from trial authors. Differences in rate of investigations and antibiotics use were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and difference in ED length of visits was expressed as mean difference, with 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Four trials were included, three RCTs and one quazi\u2010RCT, with 759 children in the rapid viral testing and 829 in the control group. Rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ED significantly, neither clinically nor statistically. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group but no effect on length of ED visits, blood or urine testing in the ED. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient, although promising, to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial but are not statistically significant due to lack of power. A large trial addressing these outcome measures is needed. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Does rapid viral testing in the Emergency Department affect the treatment of children with fever and respiratory problems? Children admitted to Emergency Departments (ED) with fever and respiratory symptoms represent a major burden to the health care system, as well as significant anxiety and expense to parents and caregivers. Physicians often order diagnostic tests and may prescribe antibiotics when they are unsure of the cause of the illness and are concerned about the possibility of serious bacterial infection. However, in most cases, fever and respiratory symptoms are caused by viruses. In addition, in children in whom a virus is found to be the cause of their illness, the risk of serious bacterial infection is very low. This review was conducted to assess whether a rapid viral test done in the ED changes what physicians do when treating these children. We found that in previously healthy children coming to the ED with fever and respiratory symptoms, a rapid viral test reduces the use of chest X\u2010rays and that there is a trend toward less antibiotic usage, and blood and urine investigations. The true impact of this intervention on the latter three outcomes requires trials with larger enrollment numbers.","publish_time":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doan, Quynh; Enarson, Paul; Kissoon, Niranjan; Klassen, Terry P; Johnson, David W","journal":"Evid Based Child Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b230afaa307d7de72618912c525a2403b7899b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163541.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ebch.543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["MEDLINE","CAB Abstracts","Emergency Departments"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of rapid viral testing","rapid viral testing group","routine rapid viral testing","urine testing","ED changes","ED length of visits","length of ED visits","rate of precautionary testing","confirmed viral infection","prolonged ED visits","antibiotics use","unnecessary antibiotic use","treatment of children","healthy children","respiratory symptoms","fever","antibiotic usage","use of chest X\u2010rays","risk of serious bacterial infection","respiratory problems","blood","urine investigations","bacterial infections","risk of concurrent bacterial infection","Pediatric acute respiratory infections","possibility of serious bacterial infection","Randomized controlled trials","pediatric emergency departments","Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials","significant burden","rate of investigations","ARIs","significant anxiety","RCTs","risk ratios","pediatric EDs","MEDLINE","DATA COLLECTION","trial authors","review authors","Missing data","extract data","MAIN RESULTS","cause","Physicians","Week","viruses","major burden","mean difference","Cochrane Library","SELECTION CRITERIA","lower rates of chest radiography","inclusion criteria","control group","large trial","diagnostic tests","diagnostic uncertainties","ARI Group\u0027s Specialized Register","means","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","Current evidence","health care system","outcomes","months of age","need","PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY","Process","expense","parents","larger enrollment numbers","ANALYSIS","BACKGROUND","Non\u2010Indexed Citations","confidence interval","intervention","caregivers","outcome measures","issue","trend","quazi","quality","Differences","families","cases","SEARCH STRATEGY","Proquest Dissertations","Theses","true impact","lack of power","EMBASE","BIOSIS Previews","CAB Abstracts","CBCA Reference","HealthStar","illnesses","OBJECTIVES","addition"],"language":"en"},

In the paraneoplastic syndrome, cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), ARA with their targeted retinal antigens have been identified. There are many other infectious, inflammatory as well as degenerative retinopathies associated with the presence of ARA. More than 15 ARA have been identified in CAR. For these autoantibodies, the autoantigens still remain unknown. Recoverin, a calcium-binding retinal protein involved in the reversal of the phototransduction cascade, is well established as the most common CAR autoantigen. The proposed mechanism of antibody-mediated degeneration involves molecular mimicry and loss of peripheral tolerance to residing retinal antigens. In vitro, ARA have been shown to cause apoptotic death of photoreceptors. Questions remain though, regarding the access and penetration of these antibodies into the retina. Furthermore, the titer of ARA does not always correlate with clinical disease status. There exists lack of standardization of antibody and antigen detection. Thus, results from different laboratories cannot exactly be compared. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pathogenic ARA is also lacking. Though there are many caveats, presence of ARA still serves as an adjunctive study for the clinician to confirm a diagnosis, which often is difficult to make. The study of ARA serves as an excellent model for the elucidation of pathological mechanisms underlying autoimmune retinopathy and its allied disorders.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"JIRAWUTHIWORAVONG, GUY V.; LEVY-CLARKE, GRACE A.; NUSSENBLAT, ROBERT B.","journal":"Autoantibodies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27b442f033760296b6a2f827fb21c49cf1eb6ede.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152344.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444527639500846; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444527639500846","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of ARA","study of ARA","titer of ARA","detection of pathogenic ARA","retinal protein","targeted retinal antigens","ABSTRACT Retinal autoantibodies","cancer-associated retinopathy","common CAR autoantigen","autoimmune retinopathy","mediated degeneration","antigen detection","allied disorders","visual disorders","antiretinal antibodies","adjunctive study","proposed mechanism of antibody","molecular mimicry","loss of peripheral tolerance","elucidation of pathological mechanisms","excellent model","variety of immune","reversal","paraneoplastic syndrome","degenerative retinopathies","specificity","lack of standardization","access","penetration","clinician","calcium","apoptotic death of photoreceptors","clinical disease status","results","different laboratories","diagnosis","phototransduction cascade","pathogenicity","autoantigens","Sensitivity","Recoverin","caveats","Questions"],"language":"en"},

The high infectivity of the disease led many governments to adopt strict regulations and measures with the aim of containing its spread. The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence, severity, and territorial expansion of COVID-19. Methods Data from the World Health Organization was screened, and COVID-19 situation reports were extracted from January 21 up till March 14 (inclusive). Our data included the total number of cases, total number of new cases, total number of cured cases, and total number of related deaths. Percentage change of cases over the days of our study were calculated using the Joinpoint regression, with a significance level set at greater than 0.05. Results The total number of COVID-19 cases reached 156,622, with 5,845 subsequent deaths. China, Italy, and Iran have the highest number of cases worldwide. During the first 22 days, the incidence rate of COVID-19 increased significantly to reach 1.81 cases per million persons (p\u003C0.001). That was followed by a significant decrease over the next 11 days (p\u003C0.001) to reach 0.071 cases per million persons. A steady rise then followed, which saw a significant increase in incidence rate to 1.429 cases per million persons (p\u003C0.001). Percentages of death and cured cases varied across the different countries; nevertheless, death percentages have generally been decreasing since the start of the crisis. Conclusion Adopting precautionary regulations such as social isolation, increasing sanitation, and employing strict quarantine measures have proved to be beneficial in containing the virus.

Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.","publish_time":"2014-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemey, Philippe; Rambaut, Andrew; Bedford, Trevor; Faria, Nuno; Bielejec, Filip; Baele, Guy; Russell, Colin A.; Smith, Derek J.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Brockmann, Dirk; Suchard, Marc A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec5eb5ea6033d1a32e46cb874e3b87b9a700cd5a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8d2f1769c1de3d813cf910561ff0401fb9d75121.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3930559.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586153/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["spatial spread of human influenza","predictions of influenza spatial spread","spatial dynamics of influenza viruses","global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2","global influenza diversity","behavior of influenza","global dynamics of influenza viruses","global dynamics of influenza H3N2","human mobility data","migration history of human influenza","global human movement patterns","spatial epidemiological models","spatial information inherent","range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread","local scales spread","standard epidemiological data","empirical data","viral gene sequences","epidemiological surveillance","viral evolution","phylogeographic approach","wealth of information","integrated approach","various geographic scales","sampled viral genomes","Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences","central role","great potential","phylogeographic reconstructions","host movement","predictive models of disease control","geographic distance","statistical framework","modes of dispersal drive pathogen","Southeast Asia","source population","insights","mainland China","ability","air passenger flows","known pandemic expansion of H1N1","model output","processes","infectious diseases","conclusion","problem"],"language":"en"},

It is often a mild disease and seldom results in paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission. In 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) coined the word SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) for an outbreak of AP in Hong Kong due to a novel coronavirus. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus AP occurred in the Middle East. Confusing case definitions such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) were coined. This paper aims to present a case of MP with sars, ARDS, pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and review the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP. METHODS: We presented a case of MP with sars, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and performed a literature review on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care. RESULTS: In early 2013, an 11\u2010year\u2010old girl presented with sars, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), right\u2010sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was treated with multiple antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not isolated in this girl with \u2018typical\u2019 pneumonia by symptomatology and chest radiography, but tracheal aspirate identified MP instead. The respiratory equations are computed with PaO(2)/FiO(2) consistent with severe lung injury. Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms \u2018mycoplasma\u2019 and \u2018ICU\u2019, \u2018mycoplasma\u2019 and \u2018mortality\u2019, and \u2018mycoplasma\u0027 and \u2018severe\u2019. Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported. Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injuries in MP infection is associated with a cell\u2010mediated immune reaction, and high responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy has been reported especially for severe disease. Management of severe mycoplasma infection in the PICU includes general cardiopulmonary support and specific antimicrobial treatment. Macrolide resistance genotypes have been detected. CONCLUSION: We urge health organizations to refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions each and every time when outbreaks of AP occur.","publish_time":"2014-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Agnes S.

We present results from hearing loss arrays developed in two different research facilities and highlight some of the approaches we adopted to enhance the applicability of resequencing arrays in a clinical setting.

However, its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of GRFT at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes, respectively, and serum GRFT levels were measured at select time points. In addition, the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with GRFT (20 or 40 mg/kg). We found that parenterally-administered GRFT in rats displayed a complex elimination profile, which varied according to administration routes. However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable, even after chronic treatment. Nonetheless, active GRFT capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing. These findings support further evaluation of GRFT for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available, including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses. In addition, GRFT should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other susceptible viruses.","publish_time":"2016-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barton, Christopher; Kouokam, J.

On the other hand, no experimental model has been developed with NTEC strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 2. In all, 14 colostrum-restricted calves were orally challenged with two strains isolated from the faeces of a diarrheic calf (B20a) or from the heart blood of a septicaemic calf (1404). All calves had diarrhoea which lasted until euthanasia in eight of them. In those calves, diarrhoea was correlated with the faecal excretion of the challenge strains. At necropsy, vascular congestion of the intestinal mucosa, hypertrophy of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and some congestion of the lungs were observed. Bacteriology confirmed the colonisation of the intestine by the challenge strains which were also recovered from the heart blood, the lungs and/or the liver. Histological sections confirmed enterocolitis, lymphadenitis and limited bronchopneumonia. In the intestinal tissue sections, bacteria testing positive in an in situ DNA hybridisation assay with a CNF2 probe were observed. Those results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti-O78 and a monoclonal anti-F17b antisera. Three of the five control calves receiving either saline or a CNF\u2212, F17a strain (25KH09) had no clinical signs or lesions. The other two presented a profuse liquid diarrhoea but those calves were positive for the presence of K99\u002B E. coli. In this model, both NTEC2 strains were thus, able to colonise the intestine, to cause long-lasting diarrhoea and to invade the blood stream with localisation in various internal organs in colostrum-restricted conventional newborn calves.","publish_time":"2001-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Bost, Sigrid; Roels, Stefan; Mainil, Jacques","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e44c4a319abb3f3ad8679e80613c2c5b22484006.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117233.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113501003601; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113501003601","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["NTEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NTEC strains","challenge strains","NTEC2 strains","control calves","colostrum-restricted calves","cause intestinal","intestinal mucosa","heart blood","long-lasting diarrhoea","colostrum-restricted conventional newborn calves","intestinal tissue sections","extra-intestinal disease","cytotoxic necrotising factor","blood stream","experimental model","intestine","profuse liquid diarrhoea","lungs","experimental evidence","vascular congestion","Histological sections","diarrheic calf","septicaemic calf","polyclonal anti-O78","necrotoxigenic Escherichia coli","monoclonal anti-F17b antisera","various internal organs","localisation","hypertrophy","situ DNA hybridisation assay","mesenteric lymph nodes","25KH09","enterocolitis","lymphadenitis","B20a","bacteria","CNF2 probe","F17a strain","immunohistochemistry","MLN","faeces","piglets","faecal excretion","clinical signs","limited bronchopneumonia","presence of K99","Abstract","colonisation","necropsy","lesions","Bacteriology","hand","euthanasia","results","liver"],"language":"en"},

A rapid and accurate diagnosis of these respiratory viruses is essential for an appropriate patient management. Molecular tests are the best detection option due to their high sensitivity and specificity. Seegene\u2019s Allplex\u2122 Respiratory Panel 1 (Allplex RP1) is a real-time one-step RT-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B. In addition, it allows the determination of FLUAV subtype (H1, H3 and H1pdm09). Objectives This study aims to evaluate Allplex RP1 as a rapid molecular test for the detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B viruses. Study design The Allplex RP1 assay will be compared with other two commercial molecular assays, Prodesse ProFlu\u002B and ProFAST\u002B (Hologic, Madison, WI, USA), and GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC (Cepheid, USA). Results Allplex RP1, ProFlu\u002B and GeneXpert tests showed 95%, 91% and 96% of accuracy; and 94%, 88% and 95% of sensitivity, respectively. Moreover, Allplex RP1 showed a FLUAV subtype sensitivity of 91% and 88% for FLUAV-H1pdm09 and FLUAV-H3 respectively, and ProFAST\u002B assay showed sensitivities of 100% for both targets. The three assays showed a 100% of specificity and PPV, while the NPV were 84%, 73% and 86% for Allplex RP1, Prodesse and GeneXpert, respectively. Conclusions In this study, Seegene\u2019s Allplex RP1 assay showed to be highly sensitive, specific, and suitable for detection of FLUV and HRSV, including FLUAV subtyping. In addition, it is also a hands-on-time saving assay due to the automated nucleic acid extraction and PCR setup.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gimferrer, Laura; Andr\u00E9s, Cristina; Rando, Ariadna; Pi\u00F1ana, Maria; Codina, Maria Gema; Martin, Maria del Carmen; Fuentes, Francisco; Rubio, Susana; Alcubilla, Pilar; Pumarola, Tom\u00E0s; Ant\u00F3n, Andr\u00E9s","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84564b1c4576582020f42d649003950aaf9f55ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106510.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218301306; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218301306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Seegene"],"organizations":["FLUAV","Allplex","GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC","FLUV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Seegene\u2019s Allplex RP1 assay","Results Allplex RP1","FLUAV-H3","FLUAV-H1pdm09","simultaneous detection of FLUAV","FLUAV subtyping","FLUAV subtype sensitivity","respiratory viruses","HRSV-B viruses","determination of FLUAV subtype","detection of FLUV","study","Respiratory Panel","Molecular tests","GeneXpert tests","best detection option","real-time one-step RT-PCR assay","Prodesse ProFlu","rapid molecular test","GeneXpert Flu","ProFAST","FLUBV","USA","commercial molecular assays","high sensitivity","specificity","addition","etiological agents of respiratory infections","PCR setup","automated nucleic acid extraction","RSV XC","Cepheid","Hologic","accurate diagnosis","Abstract Background Influenza","appropriate patient management","significant morbidity","Madison","WI","hands","sensitivities","Conclusions","mortality","PPV","NPV","Objectives","targets","accuracy"],"language":"en"},

We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt\u2010PCR) or PCR to detect 11 respiratory viruses. Among 3,662 enrolled ILI patients, 1,292 (35.3%) tested positive for at least one virus. Influenza virus (16.9%) was detected most frequently (influenza A 7.4%, influenza B 9.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (5.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20134 (4.8%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (3.8%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (3.5%), and adenovirus (ADV) (3.0%).

The 2013\u20132014 winter peaks of RSV and influenza overlapped. Compared with other virus positive cases, influenza positive cases were more likely to present with febrile seizure, and RSV positive cases were more likely to present with cough and wheezing, and were most frequently diagnosed with pneumonia. These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of ILI among children less than 5 years of age in Suzhou, China. Influenza is not only the most frequently identified pathogen but it is also the only vaccine preventable illness among the 11 pathogens tested.

In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of melioidosis cases witnessed in the region, particularly in Hainan. Meanwhile, although China has established and maintained an effective communicable disease surveillance system, it has not yet been utilized for melioidosis. Thus, the overall incidence, social burden and epidemiological features of the disease in China remain unclear. In this context, we present a comprehensive overview of both historical and current information on melioidosis in Southern China, highlighting the re-emergence of the disease in Hainan.

HCV origin was previously dated in a range between \u223C200 and 1000 years ago. Hepaciviruses have been identified in several domestic and wild mammals, the largest viral diversity being observed in bats and rodents. The closest relatives of HCV were found in horses/donkeys (equine hepaciviruses, EHV). However, the origin of HCV as a human pathogen is still an unsolved puzzle. Using a selection-informed evolutionary model, we show that the common ancestor of extant HCV genotypes existed at least 3000 years ago (CI: 3192\u20135221 years ago), with the oldest genotypes being endemic to Asia. EHV originated around 1100 CE (CI: 291\u20131640 CE). These time estimates exclude that EHV transmission was mainly sustained by widespread veterinary practices and suggest that HCV originated from a single zoonotic event with subsequent diversification in human populations. We also describe a number of biologically important sites in the major HCV genotypes that have been positively selected and indicate that drug resistance-associated variants are significantly enriched at positively selected sites. HCV exploits several cell-surface molecules for cell entry, but only two of these (CD81 and OCLN) determine the species-specificity of infection. Herein evolutionary analyses do not support a long-standing association between primates and hepaciviruses, and signals of positive selection at CD81 were only observed in Chiroptera. No evidence of selection was detected for OCLN in any mammalian order. These results shed light on the origin of HCV and provide a catalog of candidate genetic modulators of HCV phenotypic diversity.","publish_time":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forni, Diego; Cagliani, Rachele; Pontremoli, Chiara; Pozzoli, Uberto; Vertemara, Jacopo; De Gioia, Luca; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5938362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29765366/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00854","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EHV","HCV","OCLN"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["HCV origin","origin of HCV","major HCV genotypes","closest relatives of HCV","common ancestor of extant HCV genotypes","major genotypes","years","oldest genotypes","catalog of candidate genetic modulators of HCV phenotypic diversity","equine hepaciviruses","EHV transmission","OCLN","CD81","evidence of selection","selected sites","selection-informed evolutionary model","signals of positive selection","human pathogen","human populations","cell entry","important sites","evolutionary analyses","largest viral diversity","cell-surface molecules","subsequent diversification","single zoonotic event","wild mammals","horses","donkeys","long-standing association","bats","primates","widespread veterinary practices","species-specificity","drug resistance-associated variants","unsolved puzzle","time estimates","Asia","Hepatitis C virus","Hepacivirus genus","light","recognized subtypes","infection","mammalian order","rodents","number","results","range","Chiroptera"],"language":"en"},

Yet, little sequence homology between the newly identified SARS-CoV and those previously studied coronaviruses suggests that determination of protein\u2013protein interaction and identification of amino acid sequences, responsible for such interaction in SARS-CoV, are necessary for the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV replication and rationalization of anti-SARS therapeutic intervention. In this study, we employed mammalian two-hybrid system to investigate possible interactions between SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) and the membrane (M) proteins. We found that interaction of the N and M proteins takes place in vivo and identified that a stretch of amino acids (168\u2013208) in the N protein may be critical for such protein\u2013protein interactions.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given outbreak when R(0) is low or moderate, and also identifies turning points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at the i\u002B1(th) serial interval using data from the i(th) serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This model for communicable disease outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and public health interventions. Further evaluation in the context of real-world outbreaks will establish the utility of IDEA as a tool for front-line epidemiologists.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisman, David N.; Hauck, Tanya S.; Tuite, Ashleigh R.; Greer, Amy L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0916fa29144e650632aba916141809195ab6809.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3877403.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["growth of outbreaks","contraction of outbreaks","Communicable disease outbreaks of novel","context of real-world outbreaks","mathematical model","Incidence Decay","estimated incidence","actual incidence","rapid assessments of outbreak growth","duration","public health authorities","utility of IDEA","human health","simulated data","public health interventions","given outbreak","preliminary data","epidemic growth","serial interval","daily incidence counts","outbreak of pandemic influenza","cumulative size","accurate estimates of total size","accurate projections","basic reproduction number R","basic epidemiological information","existing pathogens","expansion","parsimonious function","Exponential Adjustment","explicit representation of factors","H1N1","average","population immunity","tool","SIGNIFICANCE","BACKGROUND","points","front-line epidemiologists","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","globe","METHODOLOGY","evaluation","discounting factor","new waves","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Among these, 19 adult victims with the most severe burns were triaged to our center. This is a single-center, descriptive study recording the prehospital response and in-hospital treatment of these patients. Methods Information on the attack, on-scene rescue, and patient triage was collected from public media, governmental, and hospital reports. Information on patient injury and our in-hospital procedures was collected from the emergency registry and patient records. Results Of the 80 passengers in the burning bus, 33 were injured. The total burn surface area (TBSA) of the 19 most severely injured patients triaged to our hospital ranged from 25% to 95% (mean 48.3\u00B12.08%). Two patients had a TBSA of \u003E90% (92% and 95%) and eight had a TBSA of \u003E60%. Nineteen cases of inhalation injury were diagnosed, eight of which were severe. The emergency center performed 14 bedside escharotomies, 14 central venous catheter (CVC) implantations, and one cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Approximately 131000ml of resuscitation fluid was infused within the first 24h and 111000ml within the second; further, 160230ml of plasma and 4100ml of red blood cells were infused during the antishock stage. All victims were transported to the burn ward to receive burn-centered multidisciplinary care. The respiratory team conducted 121 bronchoscopies. A total of 89 operations were performed, and the residual wound area decreased dramatically. After 124 days of extensive therapy, complete wound healing was observed and all patients entered the rehabilitation stage. Conclusion Adequate preparation, including planning and disaster drills, is crucial for handling mass casualty events. Efficient and precise first rescue and triage can reduce prehospital mortality, and burn-centered multidisciplinary care and hospital\u2013government cooperation helps reduce in-hospital mortality. Nevertheless, lessons can be drawn from this incident to be better prepared for future disasters.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hang, Hu; Jianan, Wang; Chunmao, Han","journal":"Burns","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1e1f76d0764e679749a4203590665917aef1f86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117044.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305417915002880; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305417915002880; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2015.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26526377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Methods Information"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital procedures","hospital treatment","hospital reports","injured patients","TBSA","patient triage","emergency center","patient injury","burn ward","total burn surface area","prehospital mortality","patient records","multidisciplinary care","single-center","passengers","residual wound area","prehospital response","scene rescue","emergency registry","crowded bus","cardiopulmonary resuscitation","burning bus","adult victims","severe burns","antishock stage","Methods Information","rehabilitation stage","resuscitation fluid","complete wound healing","cases of inhalation injury","planning","disaster drills","central venous catheter","implantations","bedside escharotomies","public media","government cooperation","CVC","descriptive study","handling mass casualty events","days of extensive therapy","Conclusion Adequate preparation","attack","red blood cells","suicide terrorist","Hangzhou","incident","respiratory team","bronchoscopies","plasma","CPR","operations","future disasters","Abstract Background","lessons","Results"],"language":"en"},

In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage. Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively. Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses. More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues. Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed. These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen. Therefore, the results of this study suggest a new strategy for clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment in MERS-CoV cases.","publish_time":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Yuting; Zhao, Guangyu; Song, Nianping; Li, Pei; Chen, Yuehong; Guo, Yan; Li, Junfeng; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Guo, Renfeng; Sun, Shihui; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b0f17a81d8f9849d4937aafbdbf74ec71820811.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5915580.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0063-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29691378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV cases","severe outcome of MERS","lung tissues","induced lung damage","excessive complement activation","viral infection","alleviated lung","complement activation products","role of complement","acute lung injury","previous study","spleen tissue damage","apoptosis of splenic cells","decreased tissue damage","adjunctive treatment","infected hDPP4-Tg mice","anti-C5aR antibody treatment","hDPP4-transgenic","reduced apoptosis","C5a production","splenic white pulp of treated mice","severe acute respiratory failure","C5aR axis lead","sham treatment control","viral replication","inflammatory responses","red pulp","dysregulated host immune responses","pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","high mortality","clinical intervention","observations of increased concentrations","important factor","new strategy","C5b","mouse model","T cell regeneration","greater number","receptor","sera","elevated secretion of cytokines","pathogenesis","blockade","chemokines","dysregulation","results","data"],"language":"en"},

The increasing virulence of dengue fever with dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome disproved the theory of the evolution toward commensalism, and the discovery of the microbial origins of peptic ulcer demonstrated the reach of infectious diseases.

COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020. AIM: The aim of this study is to search scientific literature in the biomedicine and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection of Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other most common chronic diseases which are on the top mortality and morbidity rates in almost all countries in the world. Also, to propose most useful measures how to prevent patients to keep themselves against COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVD, and, also, Guidelines proposed by World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and some other international associations which are included in global fighting against COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: After searching current scientific literature we have acknowledged that not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world during last 5 months from the time when first cases of COVID-10 infection was detected. Also, there is no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19. Expectations that vaccine against COVID-19 will be produced optimal during at least 10 months to 2 years, and in all current Guidelines most important proposed preventive measures are the same like which one described in Strategic documents of WHO, in statements of Declaration of Primary Health Care in Alma Ata in 1978. CONCLUSION: WHO proposed preventive measures can be helpful to everybody. Physicians who work at every level of Health Care Systems, but especially at primary health care level, must follow those recommendations and teach their patients about it.

To determine the principal cause of the outbreak, direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by sequence analysis targeting parts of the hexon gene of HAdV was performed. Serotypes of 1,007 PCR\u2010diagnosed HAdV\u2010positive samples from patients with an acute upper respiratory tract illness were determined and epidemiological characteristics including major aged group and clinical symptoms were analyzed. The principal symptom of HAdV infections was fever and the vulnerable aged group was 1\u20135 years old. Based on sequence analysis, HAdV\u20103 was the predominant serotype in the outbreak, with an incidence of 74.3%. From the beginning of 2010 until May, the major serotypes were HAdV\u20101, 2, and 5 (70\u2013100%) in any given period.

The ASC frequency reached a maximum at 7\u201310 days p.i., and decreased more than 90% in the spleen and 70% in PBMC by 14 days p.i. The ASC levels in the PBMC then decreased gradually to 0.5 ASC/10(6) over the next 8 weeks. The higher concentration of about 20 ASC/10(6) cells in spleens may, at least partially, account for the presence of antibody in the serum although bone marrow ASC were not determined. In vitro stimulation of PBMC and splenocytes with IBV antigen demonstrated that memory B cells can be activated to secrete antibody by 3 weeks p.i. ELISPOT detection of primary B cells could be useful in the early detection of infection following infection with respiratory coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2004-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pei, Jianwu; Collisson, Ellen W.","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09663bfedb806c7f965fd6510454fd2542d37cc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103210.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X04001028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X04001028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV Gray","ASC","IgG","PBMC","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute IBV infection","IBV antigen","ASC levels","ASC frequency","following IBV Gray infection","anti-IBV IgG","days post-infection","chicken anti-IBV antibody","memory B cells","secreting cells","spleens","bone marrow ASC","early detection of infection","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","stimulation of PBMC","ELISPOT detection of primary B cells","chickens","presence of antibody","contagious respiratory disease","respiratory coronaviruses","serum","weeks","severe acute respiratory syndrome virus","memory CD8","ELISPOT assay","Infectious bronchitis virus","pathogenesis","T lymphocytes","splenocytes","genome organization","effector","previous studies","poultry","account","maximum","continuing problem","higher concentration","years"],"language":"en"},

However, current preparedness plans and simulations exercises, as well as freely available simulation models previously made for policy makers, do not explicitly address the availability of health care resources or determine the impact of shortages on public health. Nevertheless, the feasibility of health systems to implement response measures or interventions described in plans and trained in exercises depends on the available resource capacity. As part of the AsiaFluCap project, we developed a comprehensive and flexible resource modelling tool to support public health officials in understanding and preparing for surges in resource demand during future pandemics. RESULTS: The AsiaFluCap Simulator is a combination of a resource model containing 28 health care resources and an epidemiological model. The tool was built in MS Excel\u00A9 and contains a user-friendly interface which allows users to select mild or severe pandemic scenarios, change resource parameters and run simulations for one or multiple regions. Besides epidemiological estimations, the simulator provides indications on resource gaps or surpluses, and the impact of shortages on public health for each selected region. It allows for a comparative analysis of the effects of resource availability and consequences of different strategies of resource use, which can provide guidance on resource prioritising and/or mobilisation. Simulation results are displayed in various tables and graphs, and can also be easily exported to GIS software to create maps for geographical analysis of the distribution of resources. CONCLUSIONS: The AsiaFluCap Simulator is freely available software (http://www.cdprg.org) which can be used by policy makers, policy advisors, donors and other stakeholders involved in preparedness for providing evidence based and illustrative information on health care resource capacities during future pandemics. The tool can inform both preparedness plans and simulation exercises and can help increase the general understanding of dynamics in resource capacities during a pandemic. The combination of a mathematical model with multiple resources and the linkage to GIS for creating maps makes the tool unique compared to other available software.","publish_time":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, Mart Lambertus; Rudge, James W; Coker, Richard; van der Weijden, Charlie; Krumkamp, Ralf; Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Chavez, Irwin; Putthasri, Weerasak; Phommasack, Bounlay; Adisasmito, Wiku; Touch, Sok; Sat, Le Minh; Hsu, Yu-Chen; Kretzschmar, Mirjam; Timen, Aura","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98ebefa9ea63cabfcfac33fb259adf77a19428af.json; document_parses/pdf_json/48cc713567a278caa4b15e0528e1babe71efe44c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dd40b192bbddb785dd3f6e42e45853cd4b14cdca.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d8714feba6d9a8670db5d8e4d998a3de95d16a3c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/df51bfb59565119816648b8f02f5a4f25ee4a76c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3509032.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23061807/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care resource capacities","resource parameters","resource gaps","resource demand","resource prioritising","available resource capacity","effects of resource availability","availability of health care resources","Health care planning","flexible resource modelling tool","public health officials","available software","consequences of different strategies of resource use","feasibility of health systems","multiple resources","simulation exercises","AsiaFluCap Simulator","available simulation models","impact of shortages","distribution of resources","simulations exercises","epidemiological model","policy makers","tool unique","GIS software","Simulation results","current preparedness plans","impact of different response strategies","pandemic influenza","maps","policy advisors","mathematical model","future pandemics","combination","AsiaFluCap project","severe pandemic scenarios","geographical analysis","response measures","predictive models","comparative analysis","multiple regions","epidemiological estimations","general understanding of dynamics","illustrative information","indications","donors","surges","challenging task","users","stakeholders","evidence","surpluses","linkage","user-friendly interface","various tables","interventions","guidance","BACKGROUND","MS Excel","selected region","graphs","mobilisation","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Some caliciviruses are known to use either terminal sialic acids or histo-blood group antigens as attachment factors and/or cell surface proteins, such as CD300lf, CD300ld, and junctional adhesion molecule 1 of tight junctions (TJs), as receptors. However, the roles of TJs and their proteins in sapovirus entry have not been examined. In this study, we found that porcine sapovirus (PSaV) significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased paracellular permeability early in infection of LLC-PK cells, suggesting that PSaV dissociates TJs of cells. This led to the interaction between PSaV particles and occludin, which traveled in a complex into late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Inhibition of occludin using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a specific antibody, or a dominant-negative mutant significantly blocked the entry of PSaV. Transient expression of occludin in nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells conferred susceptibility to PSaV, but only for a limited time. Although claudin-1, another TJ protein, neither directly interacted nor was internalized with PSaV particles, it facilitated PSaV entry and replication in the LLC-PK cells. We conclude that PSaV particles enter LLC-PK cells by binding to occludin as a coreceptor in PSaV-dissociated TJs. PSaV and occludin then form a complex that moves to late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. In addition, claudin-1 in the TJs opened by PSaV infection facilitates PSaV entry and infection as an entry factor. IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses (SaVs) cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Although they replicate in intestinal epithelial cells, which are tightly sealed by apical-junctional complexes, such as tight junctions (TJs), the mechanisms by which SaVs hijack TJs and their proteins for successful entry and infection remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that porcine SaVs (PSaVs) induce early dissociation of TJs, allowing them to bind to the TJ protein occludin as a functional coreceptor. PSaVs then travel in a complex with occludin into late endosomes through Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Claudin-1, another TJ protein, does not directly interact with PSaV but facilitates the entry of PSaV into cells as an entry factor. This work contributes to our understanding of the entry of SaV and other caliciviruses into cells and may aid in the development of efficient and affordable drugs to treat SaV infections.","publish_time":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Kim, Deok-Song; Kim, Ji-Yun; Park, Jun-Gyu; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Park, Chul-Ho; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Sang-Ik; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c6d57a5c31e345cd689687255b13506d71df902.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6364031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463963/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01773-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of PSaV","PSaV entry","PSaV infection","PSaV particles","TJs of cells","PSaV-dissociated TJs","sapovirus entry","entry of SaV","entry factor","successful entry","LLC-PK cells","roles of TJs","TJ protein occludin","Inhibition of occludin","SaVs hijack TJs","early dissociation of TJs","infection of LLC","intestinal epithelial cells","Rab5","Transient expression of occludin","late endosomes","Rab7-dependent trafficking","claudin","porcine SaVs","porcine sapovirus","tight junctions","humans","animals","genus Sapovirus","PSaVs","caliciviruses","cause severe acute gastroenteritis","cell surface proteins","common causative agents of severe acute gastroenteritis","functional coreceptor","SaV infections","junctional adhesion molecule","apical-junctional complexes","nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary","histo-blood group antigens","attachment factors","CHO","increased paracellular permeability","transepithelial electrical resistance","members","siRNA","CD300lf","terminal sialic acids","small interfering RNA","affordable drugs","CD300ld","mechanisms","binding","replication","family Caliciviridae","IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses","specific antibody","development of efficient","dominant-negative mutant","susceptibility","understanding","interaction","study","receptors","limited time","work","addition"],"language":"en"},

Its mechanism of action was studied using various state-of-the-art assays like scanning electron microscopy, DNA, RNA and protein leakage assays, growth curve assays etc. The essential oil was extracted from the leaves of A. asiatica by supercritical CO(2) fluid extraction technology. Chemical composition of essential oils was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity was evaluated against 6 bacteria by the paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC) values of the essential oil were estimated by agar dilution method. The antibacterial mechanism was evaluated by growth curve, the integrity of cell membrane and scanning electronmicroscope (SEM). Gas chromatographic analysis of the A. asiatica essential oil led to the identification of 16 chemical constituents accounting for 97.2% of the total oil composition. The major components were found to be Piperitone, (z)-davanone, p-cymene and 1, 8-cineole. The essential oil showed maximum growth inhibition against Haemophilus influenzae with a zone of inhibition of 24.5 mm and MIC/MBC values of 1.9/4.5 mg/mL respectively. Bacteria treated with the essential oil led to a rapid decrease in the number of viable cells. On adding the essential oil of A. asiatica to the bacterial culture, the constituents of the bacterial cell got released into the medium and this cell constituent release increased with increasing doses of the essential oil. SEM showed that the bacterial cells treated with the essential oil showed damaged cell wall, deformed cell morphology and shrunken cells.","publish_time":"2017-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jiehui; Qian, Chao; Xu, Hongjie; Huang, Yanjie","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d07fc5fe92e7462d054e6af1a00b034ef86e7f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29241769/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401017316546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401017316546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["MIC/MBC","SEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asiatica essential oil","essential oil of Artemisia asiatica","total oil composition","Chemical composition of essential oils","bacterial cells","growth curve assays","antibacterial mechanism","deformed cell morphology","damaged cell wall","cell constituent release","integrity of cell membrane","maximum growth inhibition","Haemophilus influenzae","shrunken cells","MBC values","bacterial culture","chemical constituents accounting","antibacterial effects","antibacterial activity","SEM","protein leakage assays","various state-of-the-art assays","minimum bactericide concentration","minimum inhibitory concentration","number of viable cells","zone of inhibition","mechanism of action","scanning electron microscopy","gas chromatography-mass","Gas chromatographic analysis","agar dilution method","paper disc diffusion method","DNA","RNA","increasing doses","identification","common respiratory infection","rapid decrease","spectrometry","current study","Piperitone","davanone","electronmicroscope","leaves of","p-cymene","GC-MS","main objective","fluid extraction technology","major components","cineole"],"language":"en"},

However, like hardness, yield strength, fatigue life, and other material properties, wear data exhibit varying degrees of repeatability and reproducibility (R/R). Repeatability concerns the replication of experiments within the same laboratory using the same equipment and materials. Reproducibility concerns testing on different equipment, usually at a different location, but using the same lot of specimens and procedures. An important question is: How many replicate measurements are needed to validate trends in wear behavior or to relatively rank materials, surface treatments, or lubricants? Without repeatability information, it is virtually impossible to establish whether reported material rankings or the effects of variables are real or fall within normal data scatter. The purpose of this paper is to characterize and analyze the R/R of wear data that result from a variety of sources, including material homogeneity, choice of units of measure, and choice of experimental variables. Case studies compare R/R for different forms of wear and their test methods, including ASTM standards. Lessons learned are presented for five forms of wear: (1) cavitation erosion, (2) three-body abrasion, (3) solid particle erosion, (4) dry sliding wear, and (5) fuel lubricity using the ball-on-cylinder (BOCLE) test. Wear transitions can also affect R/R. These examples provide insights for validating wear models, deciding how many repeated tests to make, and when ranking wear-resistance.","publish_time":"2017-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blau, P.

In this review, we summarize the state of the art of pathogenetic mechanisms of Kawasaki disease underscoring the relevance of haematological features as a novel field of investigation.","publish_time":"2017-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Del Principe, Domenico; Pietraforte, Donatella; Gambardella, Lucrezia; Marchesi, Alessandra; Tarissi de Jacobis, Isabella; Villani, Alberto; Malorni, Walter; Straface, Elisabetta","journal":"J Cell Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65aa725092d0b73054cce187137a0c22afb92d10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5345614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063205/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.12992","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["important complication of Kawasaki disease","ischemic heart disease","Coronary artery involvement","incidence of coronary artery lesions","art of pathogenetic mechanisms of Kawasaki disease","significant coronary stenosis","polymorphous skin rash","indurative oedema","diffuse mucosal inflammation","prolonged fever","feet","hands","relevance of haematological features","non\u2010suppurative lymphadenopathy","genetic predisposition","multisystemic vasculitis","interplay","microbial infection","state","novel field of investigation","introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin","place","development","young children","lines of evidence","etiopathogenesis","review"],"language":"en"},

Recently, MS has become increasingly viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder in which axonal injury, neuronal loss, and atrophy of the central nervous system lead to permanent neurological and clinical disability. In this article, we discuss the latest developments on MS research, including etiology, pathology, genetic association, EAE animal models, mechanisms of neuronal injury and axonal transport and therapeutics.

Interferon (IFN) can inhibit the replication of many viruses with low cytotoxic effects. Previously, an adenovirus vectored mouse interferon-\u03B1 (DEF201), subtype 5, was generated by Wu et al, 2007. In this study, the antiviral effects of DEF201 against EV71 were evaluated in a murine model. 6\u2013day-old BALB/c mice were administered a single dose of DEF201 before or after infection with lethal dose of EV71. The survival rate, clinical symptoms, tissue viral loads and histology pathogenesis were evaluated. IFN gene expression following a single dose of DEF201 maintained high concentrations of 100\u20139000 pg/mL for more than 7 days in mice serum. Pre-infection administration of a single dose of 106 PFU of DEF201 offered full protection of the mice against EV71 infection compared with the empty Ad5 vector control. In addition, virus load in DEF201-treated mice muscle tissue was significantly decreased as compared with empty vector control. Histopathology analysis revealed that DEF201 significantly prevented the development of severe tissue damage with reduction of viral antigen in the murine muscle tissue. Post-infection treatment at 6 h offered full protection and partial protection at 12 h, indicating that DEF201 could be used as an anti-EV71 therapeutic agent in early stage of EV71 infection. In addition, our study showed that DEF201 enhanced the neutralization ability of serum in EV71-vaccinated mice, implying that DEF201 could promote the production of specific anti-EV71 antibodies. In conclusion, single dose of DEF201 is highly efficacious as a prophylactic agent against EV71 infection in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Jialei; Ennis, Jane; Turner, Jeffrey D.; Chu, Justin Jang Hann","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d7d6b53d32356f11a9d2c30a8239444f6d89765.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113890.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216303643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623347/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216303643; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.09.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wu"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single dose of DEF201","PFU of DEF201","lethal dose of EV71","EV71-vaccinated mice","antiviral effects of DEF201","DEF201-treated mice muscle tissue","early stage of EV71 infection","anti-EV71 therapeutic agent","mice serum","c mice","production of specific anti-EV71 antibodies","murine muscle tissue","Pre-infection administration","Post-infection treatment","tissue viral loads","partial protection","study","addition","development of severe tissue damage","Ad5 vector control","prophylactic agent","murine model","reduction of viral antigen","neutralization ability of serum","low cytotoxic effects","IFN gene expression","adenovirus vectored mouse interferon-\u03B1","clinical symptoms","virus load","neurological complications","high concentrations","mouth diseases","survival rate","histology pathogenesis","replication","viruses","hand-foot","young children","subtype","conclusion","Abstract Enterovirus","pg","BALB","Histopathology analysis","days","Wu et"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study is to report the results from patients at Wuhan Children\u2019s Hospital, located within the initial center of the outbreak. METHODS: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of 76 children were collected retrospectively and analyzed with the Fisher exact test and Cox regression statistical methods. RESULTS: Among 50 children with a positive COVID-19 real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), five had negative PCR results initially but showed positive results in subsequent tests. Eight (16%) patients had lymphopenia, seven (14%) with thrombocytopenia, four (8%) with lymphocytosis, two (4%) with thrombocytosis, ten (20%) with elevated C-reactive protein, four (8%) with hemoglobin above, and six (12%) with below standard reference values. Seven (14%) of the 50 had no radiologic evidence of disease on chest CT. For the 43 patients who had abnormal CT findings, in addition to previously reported patterns of ground-glass opacity (67%), local patchy shadowing (37%), local bilateral patchy shadowing (21%), and lesion location of lower lobes (65%), other CT features include that an overwhelming number of pediatric patients had lesions in the subpleural area (95%) and 22 of the 28 lower lobe lesions were in the posterior segment (78%). Lesions in most of the 15 patients (67%) who received chest CT at discharge were not completely absorbed, and 26% of these pediatric patients had CT lesions that were either unchanged or worse. CONCLUSIONS: There were a few differences between COVID-19 children and COVID-19 adults in terms of laboratory findings and CT characteristics. CT is a powerful tool to detect and characterize COVID-19 pneumonia but has little utility in evaluating clinical recovery for children. These results oppose current COVID-19 hospital discharge criteria in China, as one requirement is that pulmonary imaging must show significant lesion absorption prior to discharge. These differences between pediatric and adult cases of COVID-19 may necessitate pediatric-specific discharge criteria.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Huijing; Hu, Jiani; Tian, Jie; Zhou, Xi; Li, Hui; Laws, Maxwell Thomas; Wesemann, Luke David; Zhu, Baiqi; Chen, Wei; Ramos, Rafael; Xia, Jun; Shao, Jianbo","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0133d0ad06635ca4caf1ad5c7dd71617fa51e3c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200209.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370747/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01596-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CT lesions","positive COVID","chest CT","CT features","current COVID","role of CT","CT characteristics","abnormal CT findings","unique features of COVID","positive results","adult cases of COVID","overwhelming number of pediatric patients","pediatric-specific discharge criteria","terms of laboratory findings","hospital discharge criteria","negative PCR results","lower lobe lesions","clinical recovery","laboratory data","adults","local patchy shadowing","differences","local bilateral patchy shadowing","pulmonary imaging","lesion location of lower lobes","Wuhan Children\u2019s Hospital","significant lesion absorption","Cox regression statistical methods","real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","addition","locations of computerized tomography","Fisher exact test","reported patterns of ground","little utility","glass opacity","requirement","China","initial center","posterior segment","subpleural area","elevated C-reactive protein","radiologic evidence of disease","pneumonia","subsequent tests","studies","infection","powerful tool","standard reference values","outbreak","study","objective","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","lymphopenia","thrombocytopenia","lymphocytosis","thrombocytosis","hemoglobin"],"language":"en"},

Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother\u2019s peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

All proteins are coded for by DNA and most neoplastic diseases ultimately result from the expression or lack thereof with one or more proteins (e.g., coded by oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, respectively). In theory, therefore, diseases could be treated by expression of the appropriate protein in the affected cells. Gene therapy is an experimental treatment that involves introducing genetic material (DNA or RNA) into cells, and it has made important advances in the past decade. Within this short time span, it has moved from the conceptual laboratory research stage to clinical translational trials for brain tumors. The most efficient approaches for gene delivery are based on viral vectors, which have been proven relatively safe in the CNS, despite occasional cases of morbidity and death in non-neurosurgical trials. However, the human response to various viral vectors can not be predicted in a reliable manner from animal experimentation, nor can size, consistency, and extent of experimental brain tumors in mouse models reflect the large, necrotic, infiltrative nature of malignant gliomas.

However, the hypothesis of codivergence between dsDNA viruses and their hosts has rarely been rigorously tested, even though the vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates for dsDNA viruses are based upon this assumption. It is therefore important to estimate the evolutionary rates of dsDNA viruses independent of the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Here, we explore the use of temporally structured sequence data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the evolutionary rates for seven human dsDNA viruses, including variola virus (VARV) (the causative agent of smallpox) and herpes simplex virus-1. Our analyses reveal that although the VARV genome is likely to evolve at a rate of approximately 1 \u00D7 10(\u22125) substitutions/site/year and hence approaching that of many RNA viruses, the evolutionary rates of many other dsDNA viruses remain problematic to estimate. Synthetic data sets were constructed to inform our interpretation of the substitution rates estimated for these dsDNA viruses and the analysis of these demonstrated that given a sequence data set of appropriate length and sampling depth, it is possible to use time-structured analyses to estimate the substitution rates of many dsDNA viruses independently from the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Finally, the discovery that some dsDNA viruses may evolve at rates approaching those of RNA viruses has important implications for our understanding of the long-term evolutionary history and emergence potential of this major group of viruses.","publish_time":"2010-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firth, Cadhla; Kitchen, Andrew; Shapiro, Beth; Suchard, Marc A.; Holmes, Edward C.; Rambaut, Andrew","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31f2b0f55f9b8bfb75904c0eca57dbb6f79bbf94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3107591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363828/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msq088; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/27/9/2038/13642808/msq088.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VARV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human dsDNA viruses","RNA viruses","evolutionary rates of dsDNA viruses independent","substitution rates","major group of viruses","low rates of nucleotide substitution","virus codivergence","assumption of host","variola virus","long-term evolutionary history","structured sequence data","herpes simplex virus","hosts","hypothesis of codivergence","vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates","time-structured analyses","Synthetic data sets","sequence data set of appropriate length","VARV genome","important implications","long-term codivergent associations","emergence potential","understanding","Bayesian framework","sampling depth","causative agent of smallpox","interpretation","analysis","substitutions","site","year","Double","pattern","discovery"],"language":"en"},

Both are essential for the success of vaccine development. To explore new vaccination approach against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection, we have shown that Rv3615c, identified as ESX\u20101 substrate protein C of M.tb but not expressed in BCG, induced a dominant Th1\u2010type response of CD4(\u002B) T cells from patients with tuberculosis pleurisy, which suggests a potential candidate for vaccine development. But subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c induced modest T\u2010cell responses systemically, and showed suboptimal protection against virulent M.tb challenge at the site of infection. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c induces sustained capability of adaptive CD4(\u002B) T\u2010 and B\u2010cell responses in lung parenchyma and airway. Rv3615c contains a dominant epitope of mouse CD4(\u002B) T cells, Rv3615c(41\u201050), and elicits CD4(\u002B) T\u2010cell response with an effector\u2013memory phenotype and multi\u2010Th1\u2010type cytokine coexpressions. Since T cells resident at mucosal tissue are potent at control of infection at early stage, our data show that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c promotes a sustained regional immunity to M.tb, and suggests a potency in control of M.tb infection.

During the last years, changed treatment regimens for non-transplanted patients with hematological malignancies have had potential to increase the incidence of viral infections in this group. In this study, we have prospectively investigated the prevalence of a broad range of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) as well as viruses that commonly reactivate after allogeneic HSCT. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with hematological malignancies and therapy induced neutropenia (n = 159) were screened regarding a broad range of common respiratory viruses in the nasopharynx and for viruses commonly detected in severely immunosuppressed patients in peripheral blood. Quantitative PCR was used for detection of viruses. A viral pathogen was detected in 35% of the patients. The detection rate was rather similar in blood (22%) and NPA (18%) with polyoma BK virus and rhinovirus as dominating pathogens in blood and NPA, respectively. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (p\u003C0.01) and patients with fever (p\u003C0.001) were overrepresented in the virus-positive group. Furthermore, viral findings in NPA were associated with upper respiratory symptoms (URTS) (p\u003C0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both respiratory viral infections and low titers of viruses in blood from patients with neutropenia were common. Patients with CLL and patients with fever were independently associated to these infections, and viral findings in NPA were associated to URTS indicating active infection. These findings motivate further studies on viruses\u0027 impact on this patient category and their potential role as causative agents of fever during neutropenia.","publish_time":"2012-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6hrmalm, Lars; Wong, Michelle; Aust, Carl; Ljungman, Per; Norbeck, Oscar; Broliden, Kristina; Tolfvenstam, Thomas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3deae058a2e470aac4ba8f9425c6150575f1522.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3343003.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570724/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPA","CLL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunosuppressed patients","NPA","viral findings","respiratory viral infections","non-transplanted patients","detection of viruses","incidence of viral infections","broad range of respiratory viruses","viral pathogen","broad range of common respiratory viruses","hematological malignancies","low titers of viruses","peripheral blood","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","upper respiratory symptoms","allogeneic HSCT","URTS","CLL","therapy induced neutropenia","causative agents of fever","virus-positive group","potential role","detection rate","polyoma BK virus","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant","dominating pathogens","patient category","rhinovirus","treatment regimens","nasopharyngeal aspirate","viruses\u0027 impact","chronic lymphocytic leukemia","recipients","studies","SIGNIFICANCE","nasopharynx","years","prevalence","CONCLUSIONS","METHODOLOGY","active infection","Quantitative PCR","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Human herpes virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and the flu (influenza A and B) are very common in pediatrics and most often cause mild disease with spontaneous recovery. The use of influenza antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors) has been studied in large randomized trials and is the focus of national and international recommendations. The use of anti-HSV and VZV compounds has not been the subject of large studies and is often more controversial (except for neonatal infection and/or meningoencephalitis). The objective of this review is therefore to offer an overview of the available data in the literature on the indications for antivirals for HSV-related infections (gingivostomatitis, recurrent herpes, herpetic whitlow), VZV (chickenpox, herpes zoster), and influenza in a pediatric outpatient setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Launay, E.; Gras Le Guen, C.; Pinquier, D.; Dommergues, M.-A.; Cohen, R.; Grimprel, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7efa2df1684a56769ba99ae5728d55279e78f62.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588932X20300565; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588932X20300565?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the available","the subject","The objective","the flu","in the literature","is the focus","the indications for antivirals for HSV","influenza in","zoster virus","VZV compounds","virus de la varicelle","virus de la grippe","infections li\u00E9es","influenza antivirals","herp\u00E8s virus humain","related infections","herpes zoster","Abstract Human herpes virus","recurrent herpes","indications des antiviraux","exception des infections n\u00E9onatales","zona","studied in large randomized trials","is often more controversial","very common in pediatrics","large studies","herp\u00E8s r\u00E9current","neuraminidase inhibitors","objet de recommandations nationales","utilisation des antiviraux antigrippaux","this review is therefore to offer an overview","most often cause mild disease with spontaneous recovery","gingivostomatitis","gingivostomatite","neonatal infection","faux panaris herp\u00E9tique","herpetic whitlow","varicella","inhibiteurs","litt\u00E9rature","chickenpox","pratique de ville","international recommendations","larges essais randomis\u00E9s","b\u00E9n\u00E9fices","variables","pediatric outpatient setting","synth\u00E8se des donn\u00E9es disponibles","or meningoencephalitis","point","internationales","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","p\u00E9diatrie","gu\u00E9rison spontan\u00E9e","objectif","mise","prescription","\u00E9tudes","ampleur"],"language":"fr"},

Isolation of populations of resident lung progenitor cells (LPCs) has been described by multiple protocols, and some have been successfully applied to healthy human lung tissue. We aimed at understanding how different cell culture conditions may affect, in vitro, the phenotype of LPCs to create an ideal niche\u2010like microenvironment. The influence of different substrates (i.e., fibronectin, gelatin, laminin) and the impact of a three\u2010dimensional/two\u2010dimensional (3D/2D) culture switch on the biology of LPCs isolated as lung spheroids (LSs) from normal adult human lung biopsy specimens were investigated. We applied a spheroid culture system as the selective/inductive step for progenitor cell culture, as described in many biological systems. The data showed a niche\u2010like proepithelial microenvironment inside the LS, highly sensitive to the 3D culture system and significantly affecting the phenotype of adult LPCs more than culture substrate. LSs favor epithelial phenotypes and LPC maintenance and contain cells more responsive to specific commitment stimuli than 2D monolayer cultures, while secreting a distinctive set of paracrine factors. We have shown for the first time, to our knowledge, how culture as 3D LSs can affect LPC epithelial phenotype and produce strong paracrine signals with a distinctive secretomic profile compared with 2D monolayer conditions. These findings suggest novel approaches to maintain ex vivo LPCs for basic and translational studies.

Because most cases of T1D cannot be attributed only to individual genetics, it is strongly inferred that there is a significant environmental contribution, such as infection, impacting disease development. The human enteroviruses (HEV) are common picornaviruses often implicated as triggers of human T1D, although precisely which of the numerous HEV may be involved in human T1D development is unknown. Experiments using non\u2010obese diabetic (NOD) mice, commonly used to model T1D, show that induction of T1D by HEV infection in NOD mice is a multifactorial process involving both the virus and the host. Interestingly, results demonstrate that HEV infection of NOD mice can also induce long\u2010term protection from T1D under certain conditions, suggesting that a similar mechanism may occur in humans. Based upon both experimental animal and observational human studies, we postulate that HEV have a dual role in T1D development and can either cause or prevent autoimmune disease. Whichever outcome occurs depends upon multiple variables in the host\u2010virus equation, many of which can be deduced from results obtained from NOD mouse studies. We propose that the background to the sharply rising T1D incidences observed in the 20th century correlates with increased levels of hygiene in human societies. Viewing T1D in this perspective suggests that potential preventative options could be developed.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza H5N1 prompted development of pandemic preparedness plans. National systems of public health law are essential for public health stewardship and for the implementation of public health policy[1]. International coherence will contribute to effective regional and global responses. However little research has been undertaken on how law works as a tool for disease control in Europe. With co-funding from the European Union, we investigated the extent to which laws across Europe support or constrain pandemic preparedness planning, and whether national differences are likely to constrain control efforts. METHODS: We undertook a survey of national public health laws across 32 European states using a questionnaire designed around a disease scenario based on pandemic influenza. Questionnaire results were reviewed in workshops, analysing how differences between national laws might support or hinder regional responses to pandemic influenza. Respondents examined the impact of national laws on the movements of information, goods, services and people across borders in a time of pandemic, the capacity for surveillance, case detection, case management and community control, the deployment of strategies of prevention, containment, mitigation and recovery and the identification of commonalities and disconnects across states. RESULTS: Results of this study show differences across Europe in the extent to which national pandemic policy and pandemic plans have been integrated with public health laws. We found significant differences in legislation and in the legitimacy of strategic plans. States differ in the range and the nature of intervention measures authorized by law, the extent to which borders could be closed to movement of persons and goods during a pandemic, and access to healthcare of non-resident persons. Some states propose use of emergency powers that might potentially override human rights protections while other states propose to limit interventions to those authorized by public health laws. CONCLUSION: These differences could create problems for European strategies if an evolving influenza pandemic results in more serious public health challenges or, indeed, if a novel disease other than influenza emerges with pandemic potential. There is insufficient understanding across Europe of the role and importance of law in pandemic planning. States need to build capacity in public health law to support disease prevention and control policies. Our research suggests that states would welcome further guidance from the EU on management of a pandemic, and guidance to assist in greater commonality of legal approaches across states.","publish_time":"2010-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Robyn; Conseil, Alexandra; Longstaff, Abie; Kodo, Jimmy; Siegert, Joachim; Duguet, Anne-Marie; Lobato de Faria, Paula; Haringhuizen, George; Espin, Jaime; Coker, Richard","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9752210c4ae3a172559d5d7b3df9575e26b7359c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2945945.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20815888/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","pandemic plans","pandemic planning","national pandemic policy","time of pandemic","pandemic potential","evolving influenza pandemic results","survey of national public health laws","public health stewardship","pandemic preparedness planning","National systems of public health law","national differences","European states","century global pandemic","implementation of public health policy","development of pandemic preparedness plans","serious public health challenges","impact of national laws","disease control","Europe support","importance of law","disease prevention","extent","significant differences","Questionnaire results","avian influenza H5N1","emergence of influenza H1N1v","European strategies","community control","disease scenario","control efforts","control policies","novel disease","case management","European Union","goods","capacity","regional responses","borders","guidance","global responses","legitimacy of strategic plans","case detection","deployment of strategies","movement of persons","little research","healthcare of non-resident persons","SARS","movements of information","surveillance","role","recovery","people","services","mitigation","containment","problems","access","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","greater commonality of legal approaches","nature of intervention measures","legislation","use of emergency powers","human rights protections","range","workshops","study","tool","identification of commonalities","International coherence","co-funding","insufficient understanding","world","Respondents","interventions","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This literature review aims to give a critical overview of the secondary metabolites that reveal the most interesting results in these two steps. Phlorotannins show great pharmaceutical potential in in vivo models and, among the several examples, the anti-dyslipidemia activity of dieckol must be highlighted because it was more effective than lovastatin in an in vivo model. The IRLIIVLMPILMA tridecapeptide that exhibits an in vivo level of activity similar to the hypotensive clinical drug captopril should still be stressed, as well as griffithsin which showed such stunning results over a variety of animal models and which will probably move onto clinical trials soon.

A docking study involving binding between the initial lead compound 1 and the SARS-CoV 3CLpro motivated the replacement of a thiazole with a benzothiazole unit as a warhead moiety at the P1\u2032 site. This modification led to the identification of more potent derivatives, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p, with IC50 or K i values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. In particular, compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities, with K i values of 4.1 and 3.1nM, respectively. The peptidomimetic compounds identified through this process are attractive leads for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics with potent inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CLpro may be summarized as follows: (i) the presence of a benzothiazole warhead at the S1\u2032-position; (ii) hydrogen bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam of the S1-site; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and hydrophobic moiety size at the S2-site and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site.","publish_time":"2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konno, Sho; Thanigaimalai, Pillaiyar; Yamamoto, Takehito; Nakada, Kiyohiko; Kakiuchi, Rie; Takayama, Kentaro; Yamazaki, Yuri; Yakushiji, Fumika; Akaji, Kenichi; Kiso, Yoshiaki; Kawasaki, Yuko; Chen, Shen-En; Freire, Ernesto; Hayashi, Yoshio","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43a01f3a7935d879533de01ab397fb4e5ae641fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127713.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23245752/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089612009017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.11.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089612009017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","i values","S1-site","CLpro","warhead moiety","S2-site","S4-site","potent inhibitory activities","phenoxyacetyl moiety","development of novel peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS","benzothiazole warhead","potent derivatives","peptidomimetic compounds","hydrophobic moiety size","benzothiazole unit","development of potential therapeutic agents","cyclic lactam","peptidomimetics","series of molecules","initial lead compound","biological evaluation","binding","attractive leads","process","appropriate stereochemistry","hydrogen bonding capabilities","synthesis","unique folding conformation","position","submicromolar","replacement","docking study","nanomolar range","structural requirements","design","identification","IC50","P1","presence","nM","modification"],"language":"en"},

This disease is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats, and it is associated with high mortality, particularly among younger cats. In this study, we isolated a wild-type FIPV HRB-17 epidemic strain from the blood sample of household pet cat exhibiting the characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms, which has been confirmed further by animal infection. Further, we developed an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the accurate detection of FCoV based on the amplification of the highly conserved FIPV N gene. Then, using a combination of the real-time RT-PCR approach and a serum chemistry assay, we performed an epidemiological survey of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China. The results indicated that the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats at an analytical detection limit of 8.2 \u00D7 10(1) viral genome copies/\u03BCL, but could not effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. Additionally, the results of the epidemiological survey investigating feline blood samples (n = 1523) collected between July 2017 to July 2019 revealed an FIPV prevalence of approximately 12% (189/1523). Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Nevertheless, it still highlighted the severity of the FIP epidemic in cats and reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines. As pet cats are household animals, risk communication and continuous region-extended surveillance cat programs are recommended.","publish_time":"2019-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Xueting; Li, Hua; Han, Meijing; Jia, Shuo; Feng, Baohua; Gao, Xuwen; Wang, Zhuo; Jiang, Yanping; Cui, Wen; Wang, Li; Xu, Yigang","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/611daf772940100411aa2dc89a2ef387bb577cac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/77d89689adb572751f60f84f795de25836c76e04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127830.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31846702/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850819303068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850819303068; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2019.101495","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FECV","FIP"],"locations":["Harbin City","Northeast China"],"keyphrases":["FIPV prevalence","pet cats","real-time RT-PCR assay","affected cats","younger cats","FIP epidemic","epidemiological survey of FIPV infection","anti-FIPV vaccines","real-time RT-PCR approach","FIP virus","conserved FIPV N gene","wild-type FIPV HRB","screening FCoV infection","effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents","characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms","serum chemistry assay","feline blood samples","accurate detection of FCoV","Feline infectious peritonitis","EvaGreen","animal infection","results","blood sample of household pet cat","virulent mutant form of feline coronavirus","household animals","epidemic strain","analytical detection limit","important infectious diseases","continuous region-extended surveillance cat programs","risk communication","urgent need","Harbin City","amplification","Northeast China","viral genome copies","\u03BCL","high mortality","severity","combination","FIPVs","FECVs","study"],"language":"en"},

The Israeli Ministry of Health/IHR National Focal Point held a workshop to elucidate health system conditions and their influencing factors that enable earlier detection. The workshop methodology employed a stepwise, small working group analysis approach to elucidate the conditions and their influencing factors affecting each stage of recognition, assessment, and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks, at the local, regional and national levels. In order to detect public health risks earlier, the detection process needs to be moved closer to the local communities and start with building capacity within communities. Building capacity and engaging with local and diverse communities requires significant changes in the governance approach and include information sharing, multi-sectoral communication and coordination across various levels before, during and after public health emergencies.

In contrast, STS/A mice were shown to be partially resistant, with a mortality rate of 30%, longer survival times and lower rates of viral production. The mortality rates, survival times and viral titers of F1 hybrids and the RI strains varied, suggesting involvement of multiple genes. STS/A, F1 hybrid and RI mice surviving the acute infection occasionally developed severe paraparesis about 1 month post-infection. In these mice, vacuolar degeneration, astrocytosis, the absence of perivascular cuffing and minimal demyelination were found in the central nervous system.

Although the paralysis of delayed onset was limited to STS/A, F1 hybrid and eight of the 13 RI strains, the incidence varied significantly among the RI strains.

Artesunate showed selective anti-Mtb effects by strongly inhibiting the growth of Mtb compared to artemisinin, and consistently induced anti-Mtb activity/effects by effectively inhibiting Mtb in the MGIT 960 system and in Ogawa slant medium for 21 days with a single dose; its minimum inhibitory concentration was 300 \u00B5g/mL in in vitro testing. Furthermore, artesunate demonstrated an anti-tubercular effect/action with a daily dose of 3.5 mg/kg in an in vivo test for four weeks, which did not indicate or induce toxicity and side effects.

Diabetes and hypercholesterolemia are also important clinical conditions that can predispose individuals to infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of rs12252 C polymorphism, BMI, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia with mild flu in an Iranian population. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, including 79 mild flu and 125 flu-negative individuals attending primary care centers of three provinces of Iran (i.e, Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan). Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from all participants, and were subjected to RNA and DNA extractions for Real-time PCR and PCR tests. All PCR products were then sequenced to find T/C polymorphisms in the rs12252 region. Data on demographic, anthropometric, and clinical variables were collected from participants\u2019 medical records available in the primary care centers. The data was analyzed using DNASIS (v. 2.5) and Stata (v.11) software. RESULTS: All participants were of Fars ethnic background. The allele frequency for rs12252-C was found to be 9.49% among cases and 2.40% among controls. Carriers of the rs12252 C allele (CT \u002B CC genotypes) showed 5.92 folds increase in the risk of mild flu comparing to the T allele homozygotes (P value: 0.007). We also found a significant positive association between rs12252 C allele heterozygote and mild flu (OR: 7.62, P value: 0.008), but not in C allele homozygote group (OR: 2.71, P value: 0.406). Similarly, we did not find a significant association between mild flu and BMI (OR: 1.06, P value: 0.087), diabetes (OR: 0.61, P value: 0.392), and hypercholesterolemia (OR: 0.50, P value: 0.393) in multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating the association between rs12252 polymorphisms, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and BMI and susceptibility to mild flu in an Iranian population. Our results suggest a significant positive association between mild flu and rs12252 C allele heterozygous and carriage. Future replication of the strong association observed here between rs12252 C allele carriage and mild flu might candidate this polymorphism as a genetic marker for early screening of susceptibility to mild flu. Lack of significant association between C allele homozygous and mild flu, observed in this study, might be the result of small sample size in this group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IR.PII.REC.1395.3.

Here, we assess the risk that the accidental escape of a novel transmissible influenza strain would not be contained in the local community. METHODS: We develop here a detailed agent-based model that specifically considers laboratory workers and their contacts in microsimulations of the epidemic onset. We consider the following non-pharmaceutical interventions: isolation of the laboratory, laboratory workers\u2019 household quarantine, contact tracing of cases and subsequent household quarantine of identified secondary cases, and school and workplace closure both preventive and reactive. RESULTS: Model simulations suggest that there is a non-negligible probability (5% to 15%), strongly dependent on reproduction number and probability of developing clinical symptoms, that the escape event is not detected at all. We find that the containment depends on the timely implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and contact tracing and it may be effective (\u003E90% probability per event) only for pathogens with moderate transmissibility (reproductive number no larger than R(0) = 1.5). Containment depends on population density and structure as well, with a probability of giving rise to a global event that is three to five times lower in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that controllability of escape events is not guaranteed and, given the rapid increase of biosafety laboratories worldwide, this poses a serious threat to human health. Our findings may be relevant to policy makers when designing adequate preparedness plans and may have important implications for determining the location of new biosafety laboratories worldwide.","publish_time":"2013-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merler, Stefano; Ajelli, Marco; Fumanelli, Laura; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae098292360fde9d65ff12d2beef927dff6c6077.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a9be3897c30e4a416d00398d86a623fc3d9faab5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4220800.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-11-252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24283203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-negligible probability","accidental escape","laboratory workers\u2019 household quarantine","biosafety laboratory of potential pandemic pathogens","tracing of cases","following non-pharmaceutical interventions","contact tracing","RESULTS","global event","risk","containment","timely implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions","location of new biosafety laboratories","rapid increase of biosafety laboratories","subsequent household quarantine","controllability of escape events","secondary cases","reproductive number","accidental release","reproduction number","Model simulations","detailed agent-based model","isolation","policy makers","adequate preparedness plans","workplace closure","moderate transmissibility","clinical symptoms","modified H5N1","important implications","school","contacts","microsimulations","novel transmissible influenza strain","recent work","intense debate","structure","serious threat","human health","epidemic onset","findings","population density","times","rise","rural areas","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","local community","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

There is limited evidence from surveillance to indicate whether amoxicillin or broader spectrum antibiotics (e.g. third-generation cephalosporins) are being used most commonly for paediatric CAP in different WHO regions. Data are lacking on clinical efficacy in the context of pneumococcal, staphylococcal and mycoplasma disease and the relative contributions of varying first-line and step-down options to the selection of such resistance.

It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The spike protein of PEDV plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells, and recent studies also reported that the neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were mainly located in the S1 subunit, which makes it a candidate for vaccine development and clinical diagnosis. In this study, we successfully constructed an immune phage display single-domain antibody library with a library size of 3.4 \u00D7 10(6). A single-domain antibody, named S7, specific for the spike protein of PEDV was identified from the phage display single-domain antibody library. S7 could be expressed in a soluble form in E. coli, bound to the spike protein of PEDV in ELISA and stained the PEDV virus in Vero cells, but it showed no neutralization activity on PEDV. These results indicated the potent application of the S7 antibody as an imaging probe or as a candidate for the development of a diagnostic assay.

(Caprifoliaceae), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, was known as Jin Yin Hua (Chinese: ), Ren Dong and Japanese honeysuckle. It was taken to treat the exopathogenic wind-heat, epidemic febrile diseases, sores, carbuncles and some infectious diseases. At the same time, Lonicera japonica could be used as healthy food, cosmetics, ornamental groundcover, and so on. Aim of the review The present paper reviewed the ethnopharmacology, the biological activities, toxicology and phytochemistry of Lonicera japonica. Materials and methods Information on Lonicera japonica was gathered via the Internet (using Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Elsevier, ACS, Medline Plus, CNKI and Web of Science) and libraries. Additionally, information also was obtained from some local books and brilliant scholars on ethnopharmacology. Results More than 140 chemical compounds have been isolated, and the main compositions are essential oils, organic acids and flavones, etc. Lonicera japonica and its active principles possess wide pharmacological actions, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative and hepatoprotective activities. Conclusions As an important traditional Chinese medicine, further studies on Lonicera japonica can lead to the development of new drugs and therapeutics for various diseases, and how to utilize it better should be paid more attentions.","publish_time":"2011-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Xiaofei; Pan, Hu; Li, Maoxing; Miao, Xiaolou; Ding, Hong","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9835859ac79e1c8a90d901b165f29c457be5965e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127058.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.08.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864666/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874111005897; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874111005897","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jin Yin Hua","Ren Dong"],"organizations":["Baidu Scholar","ACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phytochemistry of Lonicera japonica","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Lonicera japonica Thunb","ethnopharmacology","important traditional Chinese medicine","various diseases","infectious diseases","epidemic febrile diseases","Baidu Scholar","Google Scholar","biological activities","hepatoprotective activities","methods Information","sores","organic acids","essential oils","Elsevier","carbuncles","active principles","flavones","toxicology","wide pharmacological actions","studies","healthy food","antiviral","antioxidative","Medline","ACS","exopathogenic wind-heat","therapeutics","development of new drugs","Internet","main compositions","Ren Dong","local books","Jin Yin Hua","CNKI","cosmetics","ornamental groundcover","brilliant scholars","Conclusions","Materials","Web of Science","present paper","Japanese honeysuckle","review","Results","chemical compounds","libraries"],"language":"en"},

On 17 May 2013, because a chicken infection with H7 subtype avian influenza virus was detected in Guanzhou, Guangzhou became the 11th city to conduct emergency response operations. The goal of this study was to identify attitudes, practices and information needs among employees of food production and operation in Guangzhou. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of face-to-face interviews was used during 17\u201324 June 2013. All adults seeking health examination in Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention who had lived in Guangzhou for at least 3 months, were engaged in food production and operation, and agreed to participate were interviewed. RESULTS: Of 1,450 participants, 69.72% worried about being infected with the A/H7N9 and 74.41% stated that they had searched for information about A/H7N9. The internet (76.92%), television (67.56%), and newspapers (56.26%) were the main methods of obtaining information; the use of these methods differed significantly by various demographic variables (P \u003C 0.05). More than one-fifth of participants complained that the information was not timely enough (20.28%) and was intentionally concealed by the government (20.76%). Nearly one-third (32.35%) did not believe that the government could control the A/H7N9 epidemic. Most participants (80.76%) reported washing hands more frequently than before, while over one-third (37.17%) stated no longer buying poultry. A total of 84.00% indicated a willingness to receive an A/H7N9 vaccine, and the primary reason for not being willing was concern about safety (58.19%). A history of influenza vaccination and worry about being infected with the A/H7N9 were significantly associated with intention to receive an A/H7N9 vaccine (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into the attitudes and practices of employees of food production and operation 3 months after the first human A/H7N9 case reported in China, and 1 month after infected chickens were identified in Guangzhou. Distrust in the health department should be addressed, and more effort should be made to improve compliance of proper preventive measures to reduce panic among the public. The information needs should be taken into account in the next step of health education.","publish_time":"2014-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Tiegang; Feng, Jing; Qing, Pengzhe; Fan, Xiaomei; Liu, Weisi; Li, MeiXia; Wang, Ming","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45f6818a37c16f974f9be1d2e94e0ff5b9887c4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3899619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24383626/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["China","Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 vaccine","H7N9 case","H7N9 epidemic","information needs","Guangzhou Center","participants","employees of food production","practices of employees","attitudes","health examination","months","main methods","health department","infected chickens","government","history of influenza vaccination","step of health education","H7 subtype avian influenza virus","Disease Control","human infections","chicken infection","city","Guanzhou","Prevention","compliance of proper preventive measures","panic","insight","various demographic variables","primary reason","adults","China","account","cross-sectional survey of face-to-face interviews","emergency response operations","findings","study","use","CONCLUSIONS","public","Distrust","willingness","intention","washing hands","Chinese cities","internet","television","total","safety","goal","effort","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","newspapers","poultry"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the most common causes of mortality worldwide, which is why early diagnosis is crucial. Traditionally the microbiological diagnosis of these infections has been based on conventional methods including culture on artificial media for isolation of bacteria and fungi and cell cultures for virus and antibody or antigen detection using antigen-antibody reactions. The main drawback of the above mentioned methods is the time needed for an etiological diagnosis of the infection. The techniques based on molecular biology have drawn much attention in recent decades as tools for rapid diagnosis of infections. Some techniques are very expensive, especially those that can detect various microorganisms in the same reaction, therefore the question that arises is whether the cost of such testing is justified by the information obtained and by the clinical impact that its implementation will determine. In this article we make a review of the various techniques of molecular biology applied to the diagnosis of pneumonia and focus primarily on analysing the impact they may have on the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vila Estap\u00E9, Jordi; Zboromyrska, Yuliya; Vergara G\u00F3mez, Andrea; Alejo Cancho, Izaskun; Rubio Garc\u00EDa, Elisa; \u00C1lvarez-Mart\u00EDnez, Miriam Jos\u00E9; la Bellacasa Brugada, Jorge Puig de; Marcos Maeso, M. \u00C1ngeles","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c95328a30844509808a537a5c5a049664e54d7e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X1630218X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X1630218X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The main drawback of the above mentioned methods","Traditionally the microbiological diagnosis of these infections","whether the cost of such testing","therefore the question that","needed for an etiological diagnosis of the infection","article we make a review of the various","the diagnosis of pneumonia and focus primarily on analysing the impact they may have on the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections","of molecular biology applied","of mortality worldwide","Abstract Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the most common","justified by the information obtained and by the clinical impact that its implementation will","on artificial media for isolation of bacteria and fungi and cell","diagn\u00F3stico etiol\u00F3gico","diagn\u00F3stico microbiol\u00F3gico","diagn\u00F3stico precoz","based on molecular biology have drawn much attention in recent decades as tools for rapid diagnosis of infections","especially those that can detect various microorganisms in the same reaction","t\u00E9cnicas de biolog\u00EDa molecular aplicadas","tipo de infecciones","why early diagnosis","herramientas de diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","infecciones respiratorias bajas","for virus and antibody or antigen detection using antigen","been based on conventional methods including","t\u00E9cnicas basadas","antibody reactions","cultivos celulares","impacto cl\u00EDnico","infecci\u00F3n respiratoria aguda","which","very expensive","medios artificiales","aislamiento de bacterias","hongos","anticuerpos","metodolog\u00EDas","manejo","tiempo necesario","\u00FAltimas d\u00E9cadas","fuerza","reacciones ant\u00EDgeno","informaci\u00F3n obtenida","m\u00E9todos convencionales","detecci\u00F3n antig\u00E9nica","paciente","caras","misma reacci\u00F3n","mortalidad","causas","ensayos","principal inconveniente","Some","mundo","revisi\u00F3n","microorganismos","gasto","implementaci\u00F3n","neumon\u00EDa","cuesti\u00F3n","art\u00EDculo"],"language":"es"},

PDCoV belongs to the Deltacoronavirus (DCoV) genus, which mainly includes avian coronaviruses (CoVs). PDCoV has the potential to infect human and chicken cells in vitro, and also has limited infectivity in calves. However, the origin of PDCoV in pigs, the host range, and cross-species infection of PDCoV still remain unclear. To determine whether PDCoV really has the ability to infect chickens in vivo, the three lines of chicken embryos and specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were inoculated with PDCoV HNZK-02 strain to investigate PDCoV infection in the current study. Our results indicated that PDCoV can infect chicken embryos and could be continuously passaged on them. Furthermore, we observed that PDCoV-inoculated chickens showed mild diarrhea symptoms and low fecal viral RNA shedding. PDCoV RNA could also be detected in multiple organs (lung, kidney, jejunum, cecum, and rectum) and intestinal contents of PDCoV-inoculated chickens until 17 day post-inoculation by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). A histology analysis indicated that PDCoV caused mild lesions in the lung, kidney, and intestinal tissues. These results prove the susceptibility of chickens to PDCoV infection, which might provide more insight about the cross-species transmission of PDCoV.","publish_time":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Qingqing; Zhang, Honglei; Li, Bingxiao; Ding, Qingwen; Wang, Yabin; Gao, Wenming; Guo, Donghui; Wei, Zhanyong; Hu, Hui","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6673835e81ea115480bd68bc4e2d90c742bb77c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631122.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234434/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11060573","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV infection","PDCoV RNA","PDCoV HNZK","origin of PDCoV","PDCoV-inoculated chickens","intestinal contents of PDCoV","cross-species infection of PDCoV","cross-species transmission of PDCoV","susceptibility of chickens","lung","kidney","lines of chicken embryos","chicken cells","results","mild lesions","qRT-PCR","intestinal tissues","Porcine deltacoronavirus","mild diarrhea symptoms","real-time quantitative PCR","low fecal viral RNA shedding","day post-inoculation","specific pathogen free","novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","SPF","host range","worldwide distribution","jejunum","cecum","rectum","genus","multiple organs","pigs","insight","potential","strain","histology analysis","avian coronaviruses","current study","limited infectivity","calves","CoVs","ability"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a natural compound called quercetin-3-\u03B2-galactoside was identified as an inhibitor of the protease by molecular docking, SPR/FRET-based bioassays, and mutagenesis studies. Both molecular modeling and Q189A mutation revealed that Gln189 plays a key role in the binding. Furthermore, experimental evidence showed that the secondary structure and enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) were not affected by the Q189A mutation. With the help of molecular modeling, eight new derivatives of the natural product were designed and synthesized. Bioassay results reveal salient features of the structure\u2013activity relationship of the new compounds: (1) removal of the 7-hydroxy group of the quercetin moiety decreases the bioactivity of the derivatives; (2) acetoxylation of the sugar moiety abolishes inhibitor action; (3) introduction of a large sugar substituent on 7-hydroxy of quercetin can be tolerated; (4) replacement of the galactose moiety with other sugars does not affect inhibitor potency.

If an outbreak of Ebola should occur in Canada, anesthesiologists and anesthesia departments may be called upon to respond. The purpose of this review is to highlight and discuss potential ethical concepts that may be relevant to anesthesiologists. SOURCE: A thorough literature search was conducted using a variety of MEDLINE(\u00AE) sources, and we used Stand on Guard for Thee. Ethical Considerations in Preparedness Planning for Pandemic Influenza, a report by The University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Pandemic Influenza Working Group, as the framework for our review. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two groups of ethical concerns were identified. The first group relates to public health ethics, which analyzes the morality of public health interventions, and the second group relates to medical ethics, particularly to \u201Cthe duty to care\u201D. The Canadian Medical Association Code of Ethics is vague in the description of duties of physicians who may respond to high-risk contagious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Government, public health authorities, and anesthesia departments need to be prepared to respond to an outbreak of Ebola. Anesthesiologists have a skill that is suited to treat the complications of Ebola virus disease, and in case they are called for duty, anesthesiologists should be aware of the ethical concerns of treating a highly contagious communicable disease.","publish_time":"2015-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klar, Gregory; Funk, Duane J.","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c6a756686a3f5f86f2c063716e6131121698930.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073248.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-015-0416-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola","Canada"],"keyphrases":["public health ethics","anesthesiologists","outbreak of Ebola","public health authorities","public health emergency","morality of public health interventions","current Ebola outbreak","Ethical Considerations","medical ethics","World Health Organization","groups of ethical concerns","potential ethical concepts","complications of Ebola virus disease","anesthesia departments","PURPOSE","duty","review","Bioethics Pandemic Influenza","contagious communicable disease","Canadian Medical Association Code of Ethics","high-risk contagious diseases","University of Toronto Joint Centre","report","Preparedness Planning","Canada","physicians","case","CONCLUSIONS","Government","thorough literature search","description of duties","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","sources","variety of MEDLINE","framework","Stand","Guard","skill"],"language":"en"},

Powder dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions showed similar dissolution profiles for the cocrystals and pure NTZ. However, pre-dissolved cellulosic polymer in the phosphate dissolution medium (pH 7.5) modified the dissolution profile of NTZ when starting from the cocrystals, achieving transient drug supersaturation. Subsequent dissolution studies under sink conditions of polymer-based pharmaceutical powder formulations with NTZ-SUC cocrystals gave a significant improvement of the apparent solubility of NTZ when compared with analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. Scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of samples recovered after the powder dissolution studies showed that the cocrystals undergo fast dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation both in the absence and presence of polymer, suggesting that the solubilization enhancement is due to polymer-induced delay of nucleation and crystal growth of the less soluble NTZ form. The study demonstrates that the incorporation of an appropriate excipient in adequate concentration can be a key factor for inducing and maintaining the solubilization of poorly soluble drugs starting from co-crystallized solid forms. In such a way, cocrystals can be suitable for the development of solid dosage forms with improved bioavailability and efficacy in the treatment of important parasitic and viral diseases, among others.","publish_time":"2019-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salas-Z\u00FA\u00F1iga, Reynaldo; Rodr\u00EDguez-Ruiz, Christian; H\u00F6pfl, Herbert; Morales-Rojas, Hugo; S\u00E1nchez-Guadarrama, Obdulia; Rodr\u00EDguez-Cuamatzi, Patricia; Herrera-Ruiz, Dea","journal":"Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b6bbda2fc6183d26b212e74e697d6e389278c3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7022799.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31881696/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12010023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NTZ","SUC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NTZ-SUC cocrystals","dissolution profile of NTZ","NTZ-GLU","powder dissolution studies","fast dissolution","dissolution behavior","Powder dissolution experiments","soluble NTZ form","physical mixture of NTZ","apparent solubility of NTZ","analogous formulations of pure NTZ","Subsequent dissolution studies","similar dissolution profiles","phosphate dissolution medium","sink conditions of polymer","presence of polymer","pharmaceutical powder formulations","nitazoxanide-glutaric acid","nitazoxanide-succinic acid","polymer-induced delay of nucleation","pre-dissolved cellulosic polymer","non-sink conditions","transient drug supersaturation","powder X-ray diffraction analysis of samples","development of solid dosage forms","co-crystallized solid forms","soluble drugs","solubilization enhancement","effect of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose","efficacy","improved bioavailability","crystal growth","precipitation","significant improvement","treatment of important parasitic","adequate concentration","HPMC","electron microscopy","incorporation","appropriate excipient","viral diseases","absence","key factor","Methocel","HG","way","study"],"language":"en"},

To identify and classify genotypes of HCoV\u2010HKU1 in Korea, a sensitive, specific, and quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed and analyzed the sequences of HCoV\u2010HKU1 isolated in Korea. A total of 1,985 respiratory specimens taken from patients with acute respiratory illness were tested for HCoV\u2010HKU1 from January 2007 to May 2008. The major clinical symptoms associated with HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection were examined statistically and sequence variations of the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid genes were also analyzed. Fifty cases (2.5%) HCoV\u2010HKU1 were identified by real\u2010time PCR and viral loads ranged from 6.7 \u00D7 10(4) to 1.6 \u00D7 10(9) copies/ml. The clinical symptoms of HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection included rhinorrhea (72%), cough (64%), nasal congestion (56%), fever (32%), sputum (30%), sore throat (18%), chills (16%), postnasal discharge (14%), and tonsillar hypertrophy (10%). There was a seasonal distribution of HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection, peaking in winter and spring. Both genotypes A and B were detected but no recombination between them was found.

No therapy has yet proven effective in COVID-19. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment. Method. We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comt\u00E9 Hospital, France. We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions. Results. Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [\u00B12.4] vs 3.4 [\u00B12.6], p=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13 L/min vs 6 L/min, p\u003C0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, p=0.037 and higher CRP level: 158 mg/l vs 105 mg/l, p=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25). However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, p=0.002). Conclusion. Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klopfenstein, Timoth\u00E9e; Zayet, Souheil; Lohse, Anne; Balblanc, Jean-Charles; Badie, Julio; Royer, Pierre-Yves; Toko, Lynda; Mezher, Chaouki; Kadiane-Oussou, N\u2019dri Juliette; Bossert, Marie; Bozgan, Ana-Maria; Charpentier, Aline; Roux, Marie-Fran\u00E7oise; Contreras, Remy; Mazurier, Isabelle; Dussert, Pascale; Gendrin, Vincent; Conrozier, Thierry","journal":"Med Mal Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/523026efa5b9320d4cb0431ee83c59716e4ce81c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387320/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20301293?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20301293; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCZ","ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["TCZ group","outcome of patients","mm3 vs","severe COVID","severe lymphopenia","severe forms","higher CRP level","number of ICU admissions","higher level of oxygen therapy","severe SARS-CoV","death","higher Charlson comorbidity index","retrospective nature","effective treatment","retrospective case-control study","Nord Franche-Comt\u00E9 Hospital","combined primary endpoint","mortality","small sample size","work","poorer biological findings","France","pneumonia","Tocilizumab","Abstract Introduction","Method","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

It is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and most alkaloids of plants and microorganisms. Plant and microbial sources are the only sources of shikimic acid. Being a deadly viral disease, influenza causes the death of around half a million people each year. A neuraminidase present on the surface of the virus is the most important factor for viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells and hence the treatment of influenza can only be possible by neuraminidase inhibitors.

PURPOSE: To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. RESULTS: We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19.

Pathology refers to the specialty of medical science concerned with the cause, development, structural/functional changes, and natural history associated with diseases. Disease refers to a definable deviation from a normal phenotype (observable characteristics due to genome and environment), evident via patient complaints (symptoms), and/or the measurements of a careful observer (signs). The cause of the disease is referred to as its etiology. One disease entity can have more than one etiology, and one etiology can lead to more than one disease. Each disease entity develops through a series of mechanistic chemical and cellular steps. This stepwise process of disease development is referred to as its pathogenesis. Pathogenesis can refer to the changes in the structure or function of an organism at the gross/clinical level and the stepwise molecular abnormalities leading to changes in cellular and tissue function. The presentation of a disease to a clinician is in the form of a human patient with variably specific complaints (symptoms), to which the examining physicians can add diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by making observations (screening for signs of diseases).","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Funkhouser, William K.","journal":"Molecular Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee95e78d7943fcb6e9e71781a81ed83c354faa39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150046.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744197000111; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744197000111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease entity","signs of diseases","stepwise process of disease development","etiology","effects of diseases","functional changes","human patient","patient complaints","practice of pathology","symptoms","pathogenesis","stepwise molecular abnormalities","fundamental concepts","diagnostic sensitivity","overview of current diagnostic practice","cellular steps","specific complaints","tissue function","applied molecular biology","historical human approaches","vision","new interface","environment","clinical level","observations","normal phenotype","observable characteristics","genome","chapter","specificity","organism","gross","series of mechanistic chemical","terminology","definable deviation","natural history","definitions","examining physicians","mechanisms","discipline","screening","specialty of medical science","understanding of causes","Publisher Summary","measurements","careful observer","key terms","form","clinician","structure","presentation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection. The median age was 58 years and 235 were male. The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases. Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group. The percentage of na\u00EFve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases. Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases.

Our studies also showed that SIRT1, histone acetyltransferase, and NF-\u03BAB regulated the acetylation and release of HMGB1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments illustrated that PEDV-N could induce HMGB1 transcription by interacting with C/EBP-\u03B2, which could bind to C/EBP motif in HMGB1 promotor region.

Several pathogens have been associated with IBK cases, however, Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma bovoculi and bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) are most frequently observed. A multiplex real-time PCR assay using two reactions was developed for the detection and differentiation of these five pathogens. Detection sensitivities of the multiplex assays were compared to singleplex reactions testing for the same targets. Correlation coefficients (R2) of \u003E0.99, and PCR efficiencies between 92 and 106% were demonstrated in all singleplex and multiplex real-time PCR reactions. The limits of detection (LOD) of multiplex assays for Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma bovoculi and BHV-1 were 19, 23, 25, 24 and 26 copies per reaction, respectively. No cross amplification was observed for specificity testing of 179 IBK positive clinical samples and 55 non-target clinical samples. Percentage of clinical samples positive for Mycoplasma bovoculi, Moraxella bovoculi, Moraxella bovis, BHV-1 and Mycoplasma bovis were 88.8% (159/179), 75.9% (136/179), 60.3% (108/179), 11.7% (21/179) and 10.0% (18/179), respectively.

However, cellular and extracellular LAPase activity as well as total protein kinase C activity was lower in Bestatin-treated cells. Conversely, the incubation of human lymphocytic HUT78 cells with LAPase promotes HIV infectivity. The possible role of LAPase in the pathophysiology of HIV was assessed by determining LAPase serum levels in HIV infected patients. LAPase activity levels were three orders of magnitude greater in sera obtained from HIV patients than those detected in sera of uninfected individuals. Although Bestatin reduced HIV infection, a moderate decrease in the reverse transcriptase activity of chronically-infected H9 human T-lymphocytic cells was observed.

Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for ID communication. We will review the power of Twitter in ID. RECENT FINDINGS: Twitter allows for real-time sharing of educational resources at ID scientific conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend conferences to follow conferences anytime anywhere and stimulate discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. Further, Twitter chats are a valuable tool for stewardship, with different accounts periodically hosting chats on various stewardship topics. Several studies have also demonstrated the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact of publications with the help of Twitter. There is great value in engaging with non-ID people on Twitter via dissemination of ID knowledge to other disciplines. Lastly, when used appropriately, Twitter is a useful site for distributing vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities) and allows one to keep up with ongoing ID outbreaks in real time. SUMMARY: Twitter has transformed how we communicate in healthcare. Particularly in ID, where bacteria and viruses can enter/exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance for clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, is a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for HCPs and the public to \u201Csocial\u201Dize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kullar, Ravina; Goff, Debra A.; Gauthier, Timothy P.; Smith, Tara C.","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/665c7c97f04a3d100b8c1d38ab75822d39990937.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180651.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-020-00723-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Twitter chats","help of Twitter","power of Twitter","ID communication","ID scientific conferences","dissemination of ID knowledge","ongoing ID outbreaks","non-ID people","healthcare topics","global real-time information","real-time communication crucial","HCPs","various stewardship topics","healthcare professionals","social media networking sites","popular form of social media","real-time sharing of educational resources","global collaboration","vaccine information","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","antimicrobial resistance","different accounts","citation impact of publications","valuable tool","RECENT FINDINGS","strong relationship","clinicians","exit borders","infectious diseases","conduit","viruses","real time","way","barriers","useful site","individuals","great value","experts","bacteria","hierarchy","discussion","disciplines","physicians","studies","advocates","government entities","globe","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

One hundred and ten pigs were distributed in ten isolated rooms as follows: (i) non-vaccinated (NV), (ii) vaccinated with a heterologous vaccine (HE), and (iii) vaccinated with a homologous inactivated vaccine (HO). The study was run with multiple replicates and for each replicate, an infected non-vaccinated pig was placed with 10 contact pigs for two weeks and transmission of influenza evaluated daily by analyzing individual nasal swabs by RT-PCR. A statistically significant difference between R estimates was observed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs (p \u003C 0.05). A statistically significant reduction in transmission was observed in the vaccinated groups where R (95%CI) was 1 (0.39-2.09) and 0 for the HE and the HO groups respectively, compared to an R(o )value of 10.66 (6.57-16.46) in NV pigs (p \u003C 0.05).

For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at \u201Clow (but not zero) risk\u201D and \u201Csome or high risk\u201D: 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.","publish_time":"2018-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reich, Nicholas G.; Lessler, Justin; Varma, Jay K.; Vora, Neil M.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d16f97626aabd7b5350d85d8cb07498bf2386a7e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5773605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348656/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-19406-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["West Africa Ebola"],"keyphrases":["intensity of active monitoring","unique durations of active monitoring","costs of specific durations of active monitoring","optimal length of active monitoring relative","New York City\u2019s Ebola active monitoring program","expected costs","MERS-CoV","smallpox","high risk","West Africa Ebola outbreak","median incubation period","exposure-risk categories","pathogens of significant public health concern","important public health activity","month period","infected individuals","limited data","variable incubation periods","outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens","response","performance","cornerstone","disease transmission","risks","bioterror threats","CDC","analysis","lives","Guidance","morbidity","framework","days","Resources"],"language":"en"},

The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes acute encephalomyelitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases and is an important model system for virus-induced neurological disease. Suckling C578L/6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid. In addition, MHV-JHM may establish low-level persistence in the trigeminal or olfactory nerve or in one of its connections in mice that do not develop acute encephalomyelitis.","publish_time":"1989-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley; Jacobsen, Gary; Afifi, Adel","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95c486eb6b68abfff23908b451c536d1785541d2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289904467; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289904467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mice","acute encephalomyelitis","MHV-JHM RNA","acute disease","CNS","route of entry","symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis","mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM","dissemination of virus","interneuronal route","entry sites","olfactory nerves","viral RNA","immediate connections","neurological disease","chronic demyelinating diseases","important model system","central nervous system","late onset","low-level persistence","coronavirus","presence of maternal antibody","brain","early times","extracellular fluid","days","situ hybridization","neurotropic viruses","immunized dams","Analysis","Suckling C578L","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Additionally, the 3.8\u00C5 Cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibody\u2019s epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies.

Despite the severity of the symptoms, therapeutic strategies have been ineffective. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which was identified originally as a DNA binding protein, has been proposed as a mediator of acute lung injury. In addition to its anti-coagulant activity, recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM) possesses an ability to suppress the inflammatory response through neutralizing HMGB1. T regulatory (T(reg)) cells in the lungs are reported to modify innate immune responses during resolution of acute lung injury. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of rTM, and the contribution of T(reg) cells to this effect, in a mouse model of severe ARDS. C57BL/6 mice received sequential intratracheal administration of \u03B1-galactosylceramide (\u03B1-GalCer) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which resulted in the development of severe ARDS. HMGB1 levels in the lungs increased to a higher level in ARDS mice compared to those in mice treated with LPS alone. HMGB1 was expressed in the infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages in lungs. T(reg) cells were reduced significantly in the lungs of ARDS mice compared to those in mice treated with LPS alone. rTM administration prolonged the survival time and ameliorated the development of ARDS, which was associated with increased T(reg) cells and synthesis of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B2 in the lungs. These results suggest that HMGB1 is involved in the development of severe ARDS and rTM shows therapeutic effects through promoting the accumulation of T(reg) cells at the inflammatory sites.","publish_time":"2013-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kudo, D; Toyama, M; Aoyagi, T; Akahori, Y; Yamamoto, H; Ishii, K; Kanno, E; Maruyama, R; Kaku, M; Kushimoto, S; Kawakami, K","journal":"Clinical \u0026 Experimental Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf907ceaf2eaa2cc38c0dbe93135042937b36d14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3722928.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.12106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lungs of ARDS mice","cells","development of ARDS","development of severe ARDS","increased T","accumulation of T","contribution of T","T regulatory","mouse model of severe ARDS","rTM administration","therapeutic effect of rTM","neutralizing HMGB1","HMGB1 levels","LPS","severe lung inflammation","resolution of acute lung injury","mediator of acute lung injury","therapeutic effects","therapeutic strategies","\u03B1-GalCer","sequential intratracheal administration of \u03B1","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","inflammatory response","inflammatory sites","galactosylceramide","anti-coagulant activity","innate immune responses","recombinant thrombomodulin","synthesis of interleukin","survival time","symptoms","TGF","High mobility group box","ability","various diseases","infiltrating neutrophils","higher level","growth factor","addition","severity","macrophages","C57BL","lipopolysaccharide","present study","DNA binding protein","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we characterized the evolution of the major antigen-spike (S) gene in the most prevalent human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. Among the five known HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to E), higher substitution rates and dN/dS values as well as more positive selection sites were detected in the S gene of genotype D, corresponding to the most dominant HCoV epidemic in recent years. Further analysis showed that the majority of substitutions were located in the S1 subunit.

These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.","publish_time":"2015-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Lili; Zhang, Yue; Li, Jianguo; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Ying; Chen, Lan; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82d76d619e7be4f0ef2490f933d140ec9f722a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4476415.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep11451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26099036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of HCoV","S gene of genotype D","human populations","S protein","genotype persistence","human health","OC43 adaptive evolution","known HCoV-OC43 genotypes","important sugar binding domain of CoV","prevalent human coronavirus","dominant HCoV epidemic","temporal evolution routes of genotype D","positive selection sites","CoV strain persistence","important role","evolutionary mechanisms","critical sugar binding region","phylodynamic analysis","N-terminal domain","dS values","higher substitution rates","dN","NTD","insights","major antigen-spike","recent years","genetic drift","majority of substitutions","CoVs","S1 subunit","findings","date","Coronaviruses","study"],"language":"en"},

By means of a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore how the heterogeneity of the infection rate affects the epidemic dynamics, and find that large fluctuations of the infection rate have a profound impact on the epidemic threshold as well as the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold. This work can refine our understanding of epidemic spreading in metapopulation networks with the effect of nodes\u2019 local properties.","publish_time":"2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gong, Yong-Wang; Song, Yu-Rong; Jiang, Guo-Ping","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6d8ebcd8dfac7fdfa27ca40d2d4f44f24bcd514.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125748.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2014.08.056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437114007419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288090/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437114007419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","epidemic dynamics","epidemic infectivity","understanding of epidemic spreading","heterogeneous infection rate","metapopulation networks","effect of nodes\u2019 local properties","population density","individual health habits","social conditions","Monte Carlo simulations","city","links","profound impact","mean-field approach","urban area","human traveling routes","large fluctuations","subpopulation","temporal behavior","prevalence","cities","heterogeneity","paper","previous studies","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the free-ranging population has been relatively free of these same diseases. Although research into feline infectious peritonitis mortalities at a few zoos in the early 1980s suggested a possible genetic susceptibility to infectious disease, these diseases have not been noted in genetically similar populations of wild cheetahs despite evidence of exposure to infectious agents. Multidisciplinary and collaborative research has focused on the role of stress in development of disease in captive cheetahs. Subsequent improvements in husbandry and management have lessened the severity of some diseases; however, others remain intractable. As wild populations become increasingly fragmented and managed, it will be important to use the knowledge gained from captive populations to help safeguard their health and to prevent the development of disease in wild-caught cheetahs.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terio, Karen A.; Mitchell, Emily; Walzer, Chris; Schmidt-K\u00FCntzel, Anne; Marker, Laurie; Citino, Scott","journal":"Cheetahs: Biology and Conservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f428be76b49c7dffd2a5df63dbf73c664443d52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148644.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128040881000253; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128040881000253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases","wild populations","captive cheetahs","captive populations","infectious agents","development of disease","similar populations of wild cheetahs","cheetah health","feline infectious peritonitis mortalities","collaborative research","zoos","possible genetic susceptibility","impact","evidence of exposure","role of stress","husbandry","management","breeding programs","Subsequent improvements","severity","knowledge","Abstract","contrast"],"language":"en"}]}

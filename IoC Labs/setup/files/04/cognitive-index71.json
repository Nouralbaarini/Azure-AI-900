The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) is presently in clinical trials. Recent work has identified the role of Hsp90 in multiple signal transduction pathways and revealed that the molecular mechanism of tumor selectivity by Hsp90 inhibitors is the result of an activated, high-affinity conformation of Hsp90 in tumors.

This paradigm is being revisited owing to the discovery of a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nidoviruses, a monophyletic group of positive-stranded RNA viruses with a conserved genome architecture. ExoN, a homolog of canonical DNA proof-reading enzymes, is exclusively encoded by nidoviruses with genomes larger than 20 kb. All other known non-segmented RNA viruses have smaller genomes. Here we use evolutionary analyses to show that the two- to three-fold expansion of the nidovirus genome was accompanied by a large number of replacements in conserved proteins at a scale comparable to that in the Tree of Life. To unravel common evolutionary patterns in such genetically diverse viruses, we established the relation between genomic regions in nidoviruses in a sequence alignment-free manner. We exploited the conservation of the genome architecture to partition each genome into five non-overlapping regions: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame (ORF) 1a, ORF1b, 3\u2032ORFs (encompassing the 3\u2032-proximal ORFs), and 3\u2032 UTR. Each region was analyzed for its contribution to genome size change under different models. The non-linear model statistically outperformed the linear one and captured \u003E92% of data variation. Accordingly, nidovirus genomes were concluded to have reached different points on an expansion trajectory dominated by consecutive increases of ORF1b, ORF1a, and 3\u2032ORFs. Our findings indicate a unidirectional hierarchical relation between these genome regions, which are distinguished by their expression mechanism. In contrast, these regions cooperate bi-directionally on a functional level in the virus life cycle, in which they predominantly control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination, respectively. Collectively, our findings suggest that genome architecture and the associated region-specific division of labor leave a footprint on genome expansion and may limit RNA genome size.","publish_time":"2013-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauber, Chris; Goeman, Jelle J.; Parquet, Maria del Carmen; Thi Nga, Phan; Snijder, Eric J.; Morita, Kouichi; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d479fdff7406604cebef7b82284ab7a275e17925.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3715407.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23874204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome regions","genome expansion","genome replication","genome expression","RNA genome size","conserved genome architecture","genome size change","nidoviruses","small size of RNA virus genomes","nidovirus genomes","stranded RNA viruses","genomic regions","smaller genomes","genomes larger","non-overlapping regions","known non-segmented RNA viruses","diverse viruses","expansion trajectory","fold expansion","virus dissemination","virus life cycle","ExoN","UTR","findings","proximal ORFs","conserved proteins","untranslated region","different models","different points","Tree of Life","lack proof-reading","expression mechanism","evolutionary analyses","unidirectional hierarchical relation","consecutive increases of ORF1b","common evolutionary patterns","homolog of canonical DNA proof-reading enzymes","monophyletic group of positive","associated region-specific division of labor","large number of replacements","open reading frame","functional level","footprint","contribution","scale comparable","sequence alignment-free manner","ORF1a","revisited owing","high mutation rates","non-linear model","paradigm","discovery","contrast","exoribonuclease","conservation","data variation"],"language":"en"},

Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of PEDV isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three U.S. strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese PEDV strains and their likely Chinese origin. The U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent U.S. strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV. Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the PED outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent U.S. PEDV strains share unique genetic features at the 5\u2032-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission.

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kruse, Robert L.","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a17ed3e4abf295f5820c65f56398266c1baae98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7029759.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22211.2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ACE2-Fc therapy","nCoV infection","ACE2-Fc protein","nCoV entry","infected patients","potential options","viral receptor","potential respiratory viral pandemic","viral escape","protective vaccine","decreased ACE2 levels","neutralizing antibody","viral RNA genome","neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy","immunoglobulin Fc domain","options of drug repurposing","potential death","treatment","vaccine research","outbreak","possible use","compassionate use","oligonucleotide strategy","fastest strategy","quarantine of infected individuals","recombinant protein expression systems","acute respiratory distress pathophysiology","China","soluble version","timeliness","containment","promise","maximal breath","angiotensin","world population","formal clinical trials","coming months","year","speed","effective therapies","lungs","emphasis","investigators","enzyme","Wuhan","urgent need","immune system","lasting immunity","necessity","pitfalls","mechanism of action","biologic","sequence","Current efforts","mutations","approaches","novel coronavirus","future","proposal"],"language":"en"},

We report the changing epidemiology of travel-related illnesses over a 12-year period. METHODS: A single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis was undertaken for 3460 ill returned travellers presenting to two public hospitals in Marseille, France from March 2003 to October 2015, with travel-related illnesses. Demographic characteristics, travel history, presenting symptoms and information on pre-travel consultations were collected. RESULTS: There was a predominance of travel to sub-Saharan Africa, in particular to Comoros archipelago. Tourism was the main reason for travel (1591/3460, 46%), followed by visiting friends or relatives (VFR) (895/3460, 26%), with a mean duration of 29 days; 35% (1212/3460) of travellers reported a pre-travel health consultation. The most common syndromic diagnoses were febrile systemic illness (1343, 39%), dermatologic (716, 21%), gastrointestinal (340, 10%) and respiratory/ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (331, ENT) (10%). Hospitalization rates were highest amongst travellers from sub-Saharan Africa (858/ 1632, 53%), and VFR (573/ 895, 64%, P \u003C 0.001). Frequent diagnoses included malaria (797, 23%), dengue (96, 2.77%) and chikungunya (75, 2.17%), reflecting global trends. Comparison of two periods (2003\u201310 to 2011\u201315) demonstrated an increase in chikungunya and decrease in malaria and influenza-like illness. We report an increase in ill travellers from the Caribbean, Middle East and South-East Asia. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of travellers provides relevant sentinel information on the changing epidemiology of infectious diseases across the globe, most notably for malaria, dengue and chikungunya. We demonstrate the use of travel surveillance in improving pre-travel consultation needs and to address autochthonous vector-borne viral risks.","publish_time":"2018-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffiths, Karolina M; Savini, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Brouqui, Philippe; Simon, Fabrice; Parola, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4c72dd459375d5ad24fdbcf6e03b9d406fbf184.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107586.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/tay007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","Comoros","Caribbean","Middle East","South-East Asia"],"keyphrases":["travel history","predominance of travel","travel-related illnesses","changing epidemiology of travel","use of travel surveillance","travel-associated illnesses","pre-travel consultations","increasing international travel","pre-travel health consultation","Surveillance of travellers","ill travellers","malaria","chikungunya","ill returned travellers","sub-Saharan Africa","relatives","friends","Marseille","France","increase","Frequent diagnoses","dengue","VFR","changing epidemiology of infectious diseases","single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis","relevant sentinel information","febrile systemic illness","common syndromic diagnoses","Caribbean","symptoms","high numbers of residents","Middle East","public hospitals","autochthonous vector","throat","South-East Asia","METHODS","globe","Comoros archipelago","Hospitalization rates","Demographic characteristics","viral risks","Tourism","main reason","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","influenza","year period","mean duration","days","global trends","Comparison","periods","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Compared to the same period in 2017\u20132019, the daily O3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NOx concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O3 production was ~10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference). This study highlights the challenge of reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as O3 even with strict measures to control primary pollutant emissions. These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of urban pollution.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sicard, Pierre; De Marco, Alessandra; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Feng, Zhaozhong; Xu, Xiaobin; Paoletti, Elena; Rodriguez, Jos\u00E9 Jaime Di\u00E9guez; Calatayud, Vicent","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e2bec2546769accbd497ffb94f09cb1eef846c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972033059X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972033059X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern European","Southern Europe","Wuhan","China","Valencia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["urban stations","O3 concentrations","Wuhan","effect of lockdown","lockdown effect","traffic stations","O3 production","daily O3","lower O3 titration","Southern European cities","PM emissions","NOx concentrations","PM reductions","NOx emissions","weekend effect","abatement policies of urban pollution","Strong reductions","Rome","Turin","weekends","Valencia","primary pollutant emissions","air pollution","fuel combustion","strict measures","COVID","pandemic","transportation","coronavirus disease","commercial buildings","magnitude","relative change","formation of secondary pollutants","NO2","home","PM10","unprecedented reduction","challenge","results","previous years","activities","PM2","average","focus","ozone","China","increase","study","difference","period"],"language":"en"},

Here we apply for the first time phylogenetic methods and Partition Analysis of Quasispecies (PAQ) to monitor genetic distances and intra-population structures of mutant spectra of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) quasispecies subjected to mutagenesis by base and nucleoside analogues. RESULTS: Phylogenetic and PAQ analyses have revealed a highly dynamic variation of intrapopulation diversity of FMDV quasispecies. The population diversity first suffers striking expansions in the presence of mutagens and then compressions either when the presence of the mutagenic analogue was discontinued or when a mutation that decreased sensitivity to a mutagen was selected. The pattern of mutations found in the populations was in agreement with the behavior of the corresponding nucleotide analogues with FMDV in vitro. Mutations accumulated at preferred genomic sites, and dn/ds ratios indicate the operation of negative (or purifying) selection in populations subjected to mutagenesis. No evidence of unusually elevated genetic distances has been obtained for FMDV populations approaching extinction. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic and PAQ analysis provide adequate procedures to describe the evolution of viral sequences subjected to lethal mutagenesis. These methods define the changes of intra-population structure more precisely than mutation frequencies and Shannon entropies. PAQ is very sensitive to variations of intrapopulation genetic distances. Strong negative (or purifying) selection operates in FMDV populations subjected to enhanced mutagenesis. The quantifications provide evidence that extinction does not imply unusual increases of intrapopulation complexity, in support of the lethal defection model of virus extinction.","publish_time":"2008-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ojosnegros, Samuel; Agudo, Rub\u00E9n; Sierra, Macarena; Briones, Carlos; Sierra, Saleta; Gonz\u00E1lez- L\u00F3pez, Claudia; Domingo, Esteban; Cristina, Juan","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26a931d514eb3f80a779ec6d06997e1d77278dd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2515104.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18637173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Phylogenetic","Shannon"],"organizations":["Partition Analysis of Quasispecies","PAQ","FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FMDV populations","lethal mutagenesis of virus","PAQ analysis","enhanced mutagenesis","lethal defection model of virus extinction","variations of intrapopulation genetic distances","dynamic variation of intrapopulation diversity of FMDV quasispecies","PAQ analyses","elevated genetic distances","Partition Analysis of Quasispecies","mouth disease virus","time phylogenetic methods","selection","evidence","excess of mutations","pattern of mutations","changes of intra-population structure","intra-population structures of mutant spectra of foot","mutation frequencies","unusual increases of intrapopulation complexity","presence of mutagens","operation of negative","nucleoside analogues","Strong negative","corresponding nucleotide analogues","evolutionary forces","dn","support","ds ratios","molecular events","adequate procedures","preferred genomic sites","behavior","striking expansions","evolution of viral sequences","base","BACKGROUND","Shannon entropies","agreement","compressions","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","mutagenic analogue","sensitivity","quantifications"],"language":"en"},

The main objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of HPeVs infection in hospitalized patients in a period of 2 years. Respiratory samples from 3,525 patients with respiratory syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 340 patients with neurologic syndrome as well as CSF and plasma samples from five neonatal patients with sepsis\u2010like illness collected from October 2008 to 2010 were tested retrospectively using HPeV\u2010specific real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of VP3/VP1 region was performed on the positive samples. Fourteen out of 3,525 (0.4%) patients with respiratory syndrome and five out of five patients with sepsis\u2010like illness were positive for HPeV. In 3/5 patients with sepsis\u2010like illness multiple samples (e.g., stool, plasma, CSF, or respiratory samples) were available, and HPeV was found in all specimens. In contrast, no positive CSF was detected among the 340 patients with neurologic syndromes. Eleven patients (57.9%) were infected with HPeV1 strain, 7 (36.8%) with HPeV3, and 1 (5.3%) with HPeV6 strains. Ten of the 14 HPeV patients with respiratory syndrome were co\u2010infected with other respiratory viruses (eight with rhinovirus and two with coronavirus OC43). All five patients with sepsis\u2010like illness were less than 1 month of age and were infected with HPeV3. Although not circulating at high frequency and unlikely to cause respiratory syndrome, HPeV was associated with severe clinical syndromes in a minority of newborns. J. Med.

A carbon-fiber ionizer was installed upstream of a medium-efficiency air filter to generate air ions, which were used to charge the virus aerosols and increase their filtration efficiency. After the virus aerosols were captured by the filter for a certain time interval, they were exposed to a newly incoming air ion flow. Captured virus particles were detached from the filter by sonication, and their antiviral efficiency due to air ions was calculated by counting the plaque-forming units. The antiviral efficiency increased with ion exposure time and ion concentration. When the concentration of positive air ions was 107 ions/cm3, the antiviral efficiencies were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45min, respectively. When the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, the number concentrations of positive and negative ions were 6.6\u00D7106 and 3.4\u00D7106 ions/cm3, respectively, and the antiviral efficiencies were 64.3, 89.1, and 97.4% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45min, respectively.

So far, histological lesions in the intestines of pigs naturally infected with PDCoV under field conditions have not been reported. In this report, we describe the characteristic histological lesions in the small intestine that were associated with PDCoV infection, as evidenced by detection of viral nucleic acid by RT-PCR. In addition, we performed genomic analysis to determine the genetic relationship of all PDCoV strains from the four countries. We found that PDCoV mainly caused histological lesions in the small intestines of naturally infected piglets. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the PDCoV strains of different countries are closely related and shared high nucleotide sequence similarity; however, deletion patterns in the spike and 3\u2019 untranslated regions are different among the strains from mainland China, Hong Kong, the USA, and South Korea.

Among the domestic animals, domestic pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) suffers most frequently from the disease in human environment. This is a typical animal-borne disease observed mainly in occupational groups employed in agriculture, farming (of animals and birds), fishing and manufacturing industry. METHODS: We are presenting the clinical course of infection (E. rhusiopathiae) and discuss clinical forms. E. rhusiopathiae in humans may have the following clinical course: mild form of skin infection diagnosed as local erythema (erysipeloid), disseminated form of skin infection and the most serious form of infection of systemic course (endocarditis and sepsis). Mild skin infection and local erythema are the most common forms. Very rare case of animal-borne infection course has been presented in which after initial phase the disease was generalised to the abscesses formation in paravertebral space, spondylitis and empyema formation in spinal canal. In the presented clinical case, the patient was suffering from diabetes. It was probably an additional risk factor of the disease generalisation. Patient underwent drainage of empyema in spinal canal, after which his neurological status gradually improved. Antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for 8 weeks. Such course of erysipelas was not previously described in the literature. RESULTS: After therapy neurological status was improved. In follow MRI control exam empyema and spondylitis was successfully eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: Various complications of the disease, such as endocarditis and heart valves disturbances, are well known and are the most severe complications of the generalised infection. Proper targeted and long-term antibiotic therapy is crucial.","publish_time":"2012-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrychowski, Jaros\u0142aw; Jasielski, Piotr; Netczuk, Tomasz; Czernicki, Zbigniew","journal":"Eur Spine J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e400309a9601ccd52d0fbee511e868dfed9acef0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3369048.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-012-2289-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22526696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection course","clinical course of infection","animal disease","generalised infection","Mild skin infection","mild form of skin infection","serious form of infection","disease generalisation","course of erysipelas","following clinical course","systemic course","clinical forms","presented clinical case","empyema formation","therapy neurological status","spondylitis","local erythema","domestic animals","drainage of empyema","spinal canal","endocarditis","rare case of animal","patient","typical animal","long-term antibiotic therapy","domestic pig","abscesses formation","Gram-positive bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae","Various complications","severe complications","common forms","follow MRI control exam empyema","paravertebral space","Sus scrofa","birds","farming","erysipeloid","fishing","agriculture","domestica","additional risk factor","occupational groups","humans","heart valves disturbances","manufacturing industry","sepsis","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","initial phase","human environment","diabetes","METHODS","weeks","literature"],"language":"en"},

The selection of aerosol delivery system for hospitalized children can have a significant impact on the utilization of healthcare resources. DESIGN AND SETTING: A quality improvement project to evaluate the impact of conversion to MDI-spacer to administer bronchodilators (BDs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) to hospitalized children on the utilization of hospital resources. The project was conducted in a tertiary pediatric ward from April to May 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The project was conducted over a six-week period. In the first two weeks, data were gathered from all hospitalized children receiving BDs and/or ICSs by nebulizers. This data collection was followed by a two-week washout period during which training of healthcare providers and operational changes were implemented to enhance the conversion to MDI-spacer. In the last two weeks, data were gathered from hospitalized children after conversion to MDI-spacer. The primary outcomes included the mean time (in minutes) of medication preparation and delivery. Secondary outcomes included the following: need for respiratory therapy assistance, estimated cost of treatment sessions, and patient/caregiver satisfaction. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-five treatment sessions were enrolled (288 on nebulizers, 287 on MDI-spacer). The nebulizer group had more male predominance and were slightly older compared to the MDI-spacer group (male: 59% vs. 53% and mean age: 52 vs. 40 months respectively). The duration of treatment preparation and delivery was significantly lower in the MDI-spacer group (2 min reduction in preparation time and 5 min reduction in delivery time; p \u003C 0.01). Caregivers mastered MDI-spacer use after an average of two observed sessions, eliminating the need for respiratory therapy assistance during the hospital stay. Medication cost analysis showed savings in favor of MDI-spacer (cost reduction per 100 doses: 50% for albuterol, 30% for ipratropium bromide, and 87% for ICSs). The patient satisfaction survey showed \u201Cvery good\u201D to \u201Cexcellent\u201D levels in both groups.

The joint destruction common in children with smallpox might be prevented by antiviral drugs, but intraarticular infusion of antiviral drugs is unprecedented. Development of highly effective antiviral drugs against smallpox raises the issue of whether postexposure vaccination can be performed without interference by an antiviral drug. Clinicians should consider whether patients with smallpox should be admitted to general hospitals.

Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay, which is used in \u003E30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID(50)]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp-P2-negative specimens (119/273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P \u003C 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens.

The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture.

By comparative analysis of the codon usage patterns of 40 ORFs of DHV, we found that all of DHV-1 strains grouped in genotype C; the DHV-N strains isolated in South Korea and China clustered into genotypes B; and the DHV-N strains isolated from Taiwan clustered into genotypes A. The findings revealed that more than one subtype of DHV-1 circulated in East Asia. Furthermore, the results of phylogenetic analyses based on RSCU values and Clustal W method indicated obvious phylogenetic congruities. This suggested that better genome consistency of DHV may exist in nature and phylogenetic analyses based on RSCU values maybe a good method in classifying genotypes of the virus.

The putative attachment (G) glycoprotein of this virus was previously reported to have shown more extensive nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence polymorphism than any other genomic regions of this virus, leading to four sub-lineages. Using a maximum likelihood-based codon substitution model of sequence evolution, here we report that sequences of extracellular domain of 8 amino acid sites in lineage 1a, and 3 amino acid sites each in lineage 1b, 2a, and 2b have a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) than the synonymous substitutions (dS) with a posterior probability above 0.95, thus suggesting the evidence of adaptive evolution driven by Darwinian selection. Although it is unclear whether these amino acid adaptations are driven by differential immune pressure or some other factors, identification of these positively selected amino acid sites would help in better screening using epitope mapping technology to identify and localize the sites that can be recognized by the immune system. We also observed surprisingly higher nucleotide substitution rates per site, per year for each lineage of hMPV than the rates that were previously reported for the human respiratory syncytial virus, suggesting rapid evolutionary dynamics of hMPV.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Padhi, Abinash; Verghese, Bindhu","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1996f69b64707265aa7598a82d3281c4b9d7aaf6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114232.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207003279; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207003279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amino acid sites","amino acid adaptations","lineage of hMPV","deduced amino acid sequence polymorphism","discovered virus","human respiratory syncytial virus","higher nucleotide substitution rates","extensive nucleotide","rapid evolutionary dynamics of hMPV","higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions","immune system","maximum likelihood-based codon substitution model of sequence evolution","evidence of adaptive evolution","differential immune pressure","Abstract Human metapneumovirus","lower respiratory tract infections","different age groups","better screening","dN","year","sequences of extracellular domain","genomic regions","epitope mapping technology","dS","factors","glycoprotein","identification","Darwinian selection","family Paramyxoviridae","putative attachment","countries","posterior probability","sub-lineages"],"language":"en"},

However, U.S. policymakers have raised several concerns about the practical use of these models. In this review paper, we examine the extent to which the current literature already addresses these concerns and identify means of enhancing the current models for higher operational use. METHODS: We surveyed PubMed and other sources for published research literature on simulation models for influenza pandemic preparedness. We identified 23 models published between 1990 and 2010 that consider single-region (e.g., country, province, city) outbreaks and multi-pronged mitigation strategies. We developed a plan for examination of the literature based on the concerns raised by the policymakers. RESULTS: While examining the concerns about the adequacy and validity of data, we found that though the epidemiological data supporting the models appears to be adequate, it should be validated through as many updates as possible during an outbreak. Demographical data must improve its interfaces for access, retrieval, and translation into model parameters. Regarding the concern about credibility and validity of modeling assumptions, we found that the models often simplify reality to reduce computational burden. Such simplifications may be permissible if they do not interfere with the performance assessment of the mitigation strategies. We also agreed with the concern that social behavior is inadequately represented in pandemic influenza models. Our review showed that the models consider only a few social-behavioral aspects including contact rates, withdrawal from work or school due to symptoms appearance or to care for sick relatives, and compliance to social distancing, vaccination, and antiviral prophylaxis. The concern about the degree of accessibility of the models is palpable, since we found three models that are currently accessible by the public while other models are seeking public accessibility. Policymakers would prefer models scalable to any population size that can be downloadable and operable in personal computers. But scaling models to larger populations would often require computational needs that cannot be handled with personal computers and laptops. As a limitation, we state that some existing models could not be included in our review due to their limited available documentation discussing the choice of relevant parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: To adequately address the concerns of the policymakers, we need continuing model enhancements in critical areas including: updating of epidemiological data during a pandemic, smooth handling of large demographical databases, incorporation of a broader spectrum of social-behavioral aspects, updating information for contact patterns, adaptation of recent methodologies for collecting human mobility data, and improvement of computational efficiency and accessibility.","publish_time":"2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prieto, Diana M; Das, Tapas K; Savachkin, Alex A; Uribe, Andres; Izurieta, Ricardo; Malavade, Sharad","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf3abd4ab4ea9d7d602482b62166463db3dffc02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3350431.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22463370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["current models","models scalable","existing models","pandemic influenza models","computer simulation models","concerns","policymakers","validity of data","epidemiological data","influenza pandemic preparedness","social-behavioral aspects","social distancing","social behavior","current literature","public accessibility","human mobility data","development of pandemic influenza preparedness policies","broader spectrum of social","published research literature","computational needs","computational burden","degree of accessibility","personal computers","review paper","improvement of computational efficiency","contact rates","contact patterns","recent years","multi-pronged mitigation strategies","model parameters","practical use","adaptation of recent methodologies","continuing model enhancements","validity of modeling assumptions","higher operational use","smooth handling of large demographical databases","outbreaks","incorporation","city","work","withdrawal","information","critical areas","country","province","school","retrieval","limited available documentation","vaccination","sick relatives","compliance","sources","choice of relevant parameter values","symptoms appearance","population size","translation","PubMed","credibility","interfaces","extent","larger populations","antiviral prophylaxis","BACKGROUND","performance assessment","reality","adequacy","means","single-region","updates","examination","plan","laptops","simplifications","limitation","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This study estimated the burden of multiple viral and bacterial respiratory infections in moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that were prospectively followed\u2010up during a 12\u2010month pilot study. Clinical data were collected monthly and sputum was collected at the time of each acute exacerbation event. Classical culture techniques for bacteria and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray detection assays were performed to identify viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in the sputum. Overall, 51 patients were included and 45 acute exacerbation events were investigated clinically and microbiologically. Among the 45 acute exacerbation events, 44% had evidence of viral infection involving human rhinovirus (HRV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 20% and 18%, respectively. Intracellular bacteria were not found in sputum by PCR. Common bacterial pathogens were identified in 42% of acute exacerbation patients, most frequently Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Viral or virus and bacteria co\u2010infections were detected in 27% of acute exacerbation events (n = 12) with HRV and hMPV involved in 92% of cases. Patients with co\u2010infections did not present greater clinical severity scores at exacerbation and more recurrence of acute exacerbation events at 3 and 6 months than those with single infections (P \u003E 0.4). These results suggest that HRV and hMPV may be contributors or cofactors of AECOPD. These findings indicate that viral or virus and bacterial co\u2010infections do not impact significantly on the clinical severity of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurrence at 3 and 6 months.

The phylogenetic trees based on the S1, M and N genes exhibited considerably different topology and the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolates were the predominant IBVs based on the phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene.

In conclusion, multiple IBV genotypes co-circulated; genetic diversity and positive selections existed in S1, M and N genes; 4/91 vaccine recombinants emerged in China.

Consequently, it causes significant economic losses to the pork industry. There are limited studies on the innate immune responses to PED virus (PEDV) in pigs. The aims of our study were to investigate differences in innate immune responses to PEDV infection in suckling and weaned pigs and to examine if disease severity coincides with reduced innate immune responses. Weaned 26-day-old pigs (n =20) and 9-day-old nursing pigs (n =20) were assigned to PEDV inoculated or uninoculated control groups. The pigs were observed daily for clinical signs, virus shedding and were euthanized at post-inoculation days (PIDs) 1 and 5 to assay immune responses. Blood samples were collected at PIDs 1, 3 and 5. The natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cell activities (lysis of target K562 tumor cells in vitro), CD3\u002BCD4\u002B T cell and CD3\u002BCD8\u002B T cell frequencies were measured in blood and ileum at PIDs 1 and 5. The PEDV infected suckling pigs showed severe diarrhea and vomiting at PID 1, whereas the PEDV infected weaned pigs showed milder clinical signs starting at PID 3. PEDV infected suckling pigs had significantly higher diarrhea scores, earlier fecal PEDV RNA shedding and significantly higher viremia (viral RNA in serum) compared to weaned pigs. There was no mortality in either infected suckling or infected weaned pigs. The control pigs not inoculated with PEDV did not show any clinical signs and no detectable fecal or serum PEDV RNA. Strikingly, PEDV infected suckling pigs had significantly lower NK cell frequencies, undetectable NK cell activity and lower IFN\u03B3 producing NK cells in blood and ileum compared to PEDV infected weaned pigs. Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of PEDV infected suckling pigs differed from those of PEDV infected weaned pigs and coincided with onset of fecal PEDV RNA shedding and serum PEDV RNA titers. The infected suckling pigs have higher and earlier increases in serum IFN\u03B1, but lower serum IL-8 and TNF\u03B1 levels compared to infected weaned pigs. CD3\u002BCD4\u002B T cell frequencies were significantly higher in ileum of suckling pigs than in weaned pigs, whereas there was no difference in CD3\u002BCD8\u002B T cell frequencies. In conclusion, the observations of impaired lytic activity and IFN-\u03B3 production by NK cells in suckling pigs coincided with the increased severity of PEDV infection in the suckling pigs compared with the weaned pigs.","publish_time":"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annamalai, Thavamathi; Saif, Linda J.; Lu, Zhongyan; Jung, Kwonil","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a09e9f3ff98c3f458a0602f0795bad0561a7f72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112776.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242715002032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433606/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242715002032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","NK","PID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infected weaned pigs","day-old pigs","control pigs","ileum of suckling pigs","older pigs","day-old nursing pigs","Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of PEDV infected suckling pigs","serum PEDV RNA titers","onset of fecal PEDV RNA","T cell frequencies","lower NK cell frequencies","increased severity of PEDV infection","NK cell activities","NK cells","undetectable NK cell activity","CD3","lower serum IL","serum IFN\u03B1","severe diarrhea","viral RNA","reduced innate immune responses","PIDs","higher diarrhea scores","higher viremia","severe disease","milder clinical signs","lower IFN\u03B3","severe morbidity","disease severity","PED virus","CD8","CD4","Blood samples","mortality","enteric coronaviral infection","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea","earlier increases","lysis of target K562 tumor cells","uninoculated control groups","observations of impaired lytic activity","IFN-\u03B3 production","TNF\u03B1 levels","differences","significant economic losses","pork industry","limited studies","natural killer","post-inoculation days","conclusion","study","aims"],"language":"en"},

Soon after the trial began, each volunteer experienced a \u201Ccytokine storm\u201D, a dramatic increase in cytokine concentrations. The monoclonal antibody, TGN1412, raised serum concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines \u03C4\u03BF very hi\u03B3h values during the first day, while lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations plummeted. Because the subjects were healthy and had no prior indications of immune deficiency, this event provided an unusual opportunity to study the dynamic interactions of cytokines and other measured parameters. Here, the response histories of nine cytokines have been modeled by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. A general search procedure identifies parameters of the model, whose response fits the data well during the five-day measurement period. The eighteenth-order model reveals plausible cause-and-effect relationships among the cytokines, showing how each cytokine induces or inhibits other cytokines. It suggests that perturbations in IL2, IL8, and IL10 have the most significant inductive effect, while IFN-\u03B3 and IL12 have the greatest inhibiting effect on other cytokine concentrations. Although TNF-\u03B1 is a major pro-inflammatory factor, IFN-\u03B3 and three other cytokines have faster initial and median response to TGN1412 infusion. Principal-component analysis of the data reveals three clusters of similar cytokine responses: [TNF-\u03B1, IL1, IL10], [IFN-\u03B3, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. IL1, IL6, IL10, and TNF-\u03B1 have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates. This study illuminates details of a cytokine storm event, and it demonstrates the value of linear modeling for interpreting complex, coupled biological system dynamics from empirical data.","publish_time":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yiu, Hao Hong; Graham, Andrea L.; Stengel, Robert F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a646c8ced739fd583e7e031a90e4936f2a764035.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3462188.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23049677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytokine concentrations","median response","response histories","cytokine storm event","IFN-\u03B3","TNF-\u03B1","severe inflammatory response","IL10","anti-inflammatory cytokines \u03C4\u03BF","dynamic interactions of cytokines","serum concentrations","monocyte concentrations","clusters of similar cytokine responses","regulatory T cell response","empirical data","effect relationships","IL12","monoclonal antibody","IL8","IL2","IL6","greatest inhibiting effect","significant inductive effect","major pro-inflammatory factor","measured parameters","clinical trial","TGN1412 infusion","order model","uncertain initial conditions","value of linear modeling","study illuminates details","set of linear ordinary differential equations","interpreting complex","exogenous effects","biological system dynamics","Phase","highest degree of variability","hi\u03B3h values","plausible cause","prior indications of immune deficiency","IL4","dramatic increase","unusual opportunity","general search procedure","parameter estimates","Principal-component analysis","five-day measurement period","lymphocyte","volunteers","subjects","perturbations"],"language":"en"},

This symptom-complex arises on the basis of chronic allergic inflammation of the airway wall. Consequently, the airway epithelium is central to the pathogenesis of this disease, because its multiple abilities directly have an impact on the inflammatory response and thus the formation of the disease. In turn, its structure and functions are markedly impaired by the inflammation. Hence, the airway epithelium represents a sealed, self-cleaning barrier, that prohibits penetration of inhaled allergens, pathogens, and other noxious agents into the body. This barrier is covered with mucus that further contains antimicrobial peptides and antibodies that are either produced or specifically transported by the airway epithelium in order to trap these particles and to remove them from the body by a process called mucociliary clearance. Once this first line of defense of the lung is overcome, airway epithelial cells are the first cells to get in contact with pathogens, to be damaged or infected. Therefore, these cells release a plethora of chemokines and cytokines that not only induce an acute inflammatory reaction but also have an impact on the alignment of the following immune reaction. In case of asthma, all these functions are impaired by the already existing allergic immune response that per se weakens the barrier integrity and self-cleaning abilities of the airway epithelium making it more vulnerable to penetration of allergens as well as of infection by bacteria and viruses. Recent studies indicate that the history of allergy- and pathogen-derived insults can leave some kind of memory in these cells that can be described as imprinting or trained immunity. Thus, the airway epithelium is in the center of processes that lead to formation, progression and acute exacerbation of asthma.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frey, Andreas; Lunding, Lars P.; Ehlers, Johanna C.; Weckmann, Markus; Zissler, Ulrich M.; Wegmann, Michael","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edcc0ad9ca14035c079206323b6c164901e19406.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198799.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411147/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00761","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway epithelium","airway wall","airway epithelial cells","self-cleaning barrier","chronic disease","Allergic bronchial asthma","acute exacerbation of asthma","acute inflammatory reaction","self-cleaning abilities","basis of chronic allergic inflammation","pathogens","existing allergic immune response","functions","impact","formation","barrier integrity","penetration of allergens","inflammatory response","case of asthma","body","acute episodes of broncho","penetration of inhaled allergens","following immune reaction","multiple abilities","chest tightness","productive cough","symptoms","progression","lung","history of allergy","pathogen-derived insults","respiratory distress","alignment","center of processes","pathogenesis","kind of memory","noxious agents","antimicrobial peptides","infection","mucociliary clearance","mucus","cytokines","obstruction","plethora of chemokines","structure","airways","contact","order","Recent studies","symptom-complex","bacteria","viruses","antibodies","line of defense","turn","particles","trained immunity"],"language":"en"},

Due to the speedy development in the field of salivaomics, saliva is now well accepted as a pool of biological markers that vary from changes in biochemicals, nucleic acids and proteins to the microflora. Saliva has an immense potential as a diagnostic fluid and offers an edge over other biological fluids as its collection method does not require invasive procedure, economical and is useful for monitoring systemic health. Development of sensitive and precise salivary diagnostic tools and the formulation of defined guidelines following meticulous testing will allow salivary diagnostics to be utilised as chair side tests for various oral and systemic diseases in the near future. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is the biggest challenge and global health crisis for the world since World War Two. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen types for Covid-19 diagnostic testing. The collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients and poses a risk of transmission of the virus, causes discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with condition such as thrombocytopenia. Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable for sequential monitoring of viral load. Saliva specimens can be obtained easily as the patient is asked to spit into a sterile bottle. The collection of saliva is non-invasive and greatly minimizes the exposure of healthcare workers to Covid-19. Saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90% with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers. Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care. More research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing aerosol-generating procedures.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sri Santosh, Tatikonda; Parmar, Reshu; Anand, Hanish; Srikanth, Konkati; Saritha, Madham","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa1f36a1a59e738e319b53d31b53dcb761084676.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164701.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["collection of saliva","Saliva specimens","potential diagnostic of Covid","detection of Covid","diagnostic testing","salivary diagnostics","accurate diagnosis of Covid","clinical monitoring of systemic health","precise salivary diagnostic tools","salivary glands","diagnostic fluid","nasopharyngeal specimens","detection of respiratory viruses","hospitalized patients","systemic diseases","tests","oropharyngeal swabs","screening respiratory viruses","respiratory symptoms","exposure of healthcare workers","disease diagnosis","rapid chair","collection method","healthcare professionals","recommended specimen types","global health crisis","oral cavity","meticulous testing","sequential monitoring of viral load","World War","Development of sensitive","biological fluids","field of salivaomics","immense potential","speedy development","dynamic field","coronavirus disease","patient care","high titers","significant clinical decisions","pool of biological markers","high consistency rate of greater","formulation of defined guidelines","close contact","pyrexia","antimicrobial effects","nucleic acids","biochemicals","changes","aids","invasive procedure","biggest challenge","pandemic","proteins","protection","prevention","dentists","risk of transmission","edge","exocrine secretion","successful strategies","numerous functions","near future","outbreak","discomfort","microflora","digestion","condition","bleeding","coronaviruses","aerosol","community","hospitals","thrombocytopenia","SARS-CoV","sterile bottle","procedures","research"],"language":"en"},

A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient\u2019s weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted. Studies which, along these lines, show an environmental impact on genetic secretion in the phenotype are underlined. Also discussed in passing are several mechanisms which go towards explaining neutrophilic asthma \u2013 for many a contradiction, given eosinophilia\u2019s stranglehold on asthmatic inflammation.

In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China. METHODS: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively.

Viruses, including herpesviruses, have acquired functional CD200 orthologs, implying that viral exploitation of this pathway is evolutionary advantageous. However, the role that CD200R signaling plays during herpesvirus infection in vivo requires clarification. Utilizing the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) model, we demonstrate that CD200R facilitates virus persistence within mucosal tissue. Specifically, MCMV infection of CD200R-deficient mice (CD200R(-/-)) elicited heightened mucosal virus-specific CD4 T cell responses that restricted virus persistence in the salivary glands. CD200R did not directly inhibit lymphocyte effector function. Instead, CD200R(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced APC accumulation that in the mucosa was a consequence of elevated cellular proliferation. Although MCMV does not encode an obvious CD200 homolog, productive replication in macrophages induced expression of cellular CD200. CD200 from hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells contributed independently to suppression of antiviral control in vivo. These results highlight the CD200-CD200R pathway as an important regulator of antiviral immunity during cytomegalovirus infection that is exploited by MCMV to establish chronicity within mucosal tissue.","publish_time":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stack, Gabrielle; Jones, Emma; Marsden, Morgan; Stacey, Maria A.; Snelgrove, Robert J.; Lacaze, Paul; Jacques, Laura C.; Cuff, Simone M.; Stanton, Richard J.; Gallimore, Awen M.; Hussell, Tracy; Wilkinson, Gavin W.

What had been studied initially as a \u201Cunique\u201D endoribonuclease is currently known as ribonuclease L (RNase L where \u201CL\u201D stands for latent). Some of the key developments include discovery of the RNase L signaling pathway, its structural characterization, and its molecular cloning. RNase L has been implicated in antiviral and antibacterial defense, as well as in hereditary prostate cancer. RNase L is activated by 2\u2032-5\u2032 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), which are synthesized by the oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), a family of IFN-regulated pathogen recognition receptors that sense double-stranded RNAs. Activated RNase L cleaves single stranded RNAs, including viral RNAs and cellular RNAs. The catalytic activity of RNase L has been found to lead into the activation of several cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, apoptosis, IFN-\u03B2 production, NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to IL-1\u03B2 secretion, inhibition of cell migration, and cell adhesion. In this review, we will highlight the newest advances in our understanding of the catalytic role of RNase L in the context of different cellular pathways and extend the scope of these findings to discussion of potential therapeutic targets for antimicrobial drug development.","publish_time":"2016-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gusho, Elona; Baskar, Danika; Banerjee, Shuvojit","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abe9eca0a68de6871fcb8fcc513a49181bcc2531.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128181.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466616304562; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466616304562; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2016.08.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27595182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Activated RNase","cellular RNAs","catalytic role of RNase","catalytic activity of RNase","viral RNAs","double-stranded RNAs","single stranded RNAs","IFN-\u03B2 production","family of IFN","regulated ribonuclease","discovery","understanding","context of different cellular pathways","\u03B2 secretion","cell adhesion","significant advances","newest advances","inhibition of cell migration","NLRP3 inflammasome activation","regulated pathogen recognition receptors","discussion of potential therapeutic targets","antimicrobial drug development","findings","scope","interferon","structural characterization","OASs","apoptosis","autophagy","regulatory effects","molecular cloning","antiviral","existence","key developments","antibacterial defense","oligoadenylate synthetases","hereditary prostate cancer","mechanism","action","endoribonuclease","linked oligoadenylates","review"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we highlight the importance of the S protein in the MERS-CoV life cycle, summarize recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on the S protein, and discuss strategies that can be explored to develop new medical countermeasures against MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qihui; Wong, Gary; Lu, Guangwen; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/469f56e7c8db4736c730dd334c9b46319833fc69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113765.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27468951/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216301826; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216301826","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV spike","MERS-CoV life cycle","S protein","therapeutics","licensed vaccines","development of vaccines","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recent advances","cell-mediated responses","host-receptor binding","important viral antigen","virus entry","disease outbreak","humans","great efforts","new medical countermeasures","infection","importance","strategies","review","people"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26\u201375 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P \u003C 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P \u003C 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R(range), 0.36\u20130.75; P \u003C 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001\u20130.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Ying; Sun, Dong; Liu, Yao; Fan, Yanqing; Zhao, Lingyun; Li, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenzhen","journal":"Invest Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e9294dfbcb737fd27e2b336a374d5a1d891a17c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0c36b0751e485059d4fbd5335361016af450331b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32134800/; https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000674","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["initial CT features","high-resolution CT features","Follow-up CT findings","Follow-up CT images","severity of opacifications","progression of opacifications","severity of COVID","progressive opacifications","days","severity of pneumonia","illness onset","clinical parameters","patients","progression of pneumonia","sum score of opacifications","infection","Spearman correlation","positive correlation","moderate correlation","early stage","novel coronavirus","outbreak of coronavirus disease","significant correlations","progressive process","laboratory measurements","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","high-resolution chest computed tomography","consolidation","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","interstitial thickening","fibrous strips","lactate dehydrogenase","progressions","air bronchograms","typical ground glass opacities","C-reactive protein","linear regression analysis","mean","China","years","highest temperature","relationship","range","regular treatments","Wuhan","males","CONCLUSIONS","MATERIALS","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

First, we provide a brief description of risks associated with continued in-person ABA service delivery, as well as risks associated with the temporary suspension of services or the transition to remote ABA service delivery. For many clients, continued in-person service delivery carries a significant risk of severe harm to the client, family and caregivers, staff, and a currently overburdened health care system. In these situations, ABA providers should temporarily suspend services or transition to telehealth or other forms of remote service delivery until information from federal, state, and local health care experts deems in-person contact safe. In rare cases, temporary suspension of services or a transition to remote service delivery may place the client or others at risk of significant harm. In these situations, in-person services should likely continue, and ongoing assessment and risk mitigation are essential.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cox, David J.; Plavnick, Joshua B.; Brodhead, Matthew T.","journal":"Behav Anal Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9da2bf161b5212dad7d544e76569032ead84c29e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178923.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-020-00430-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["person ABA services","person ABA service delivery","person service delivery","person services","remote ABA service delivery","ABA providers","forms of remote service delivery","transition","temporary suspension of services","essential personnel","risk of significant harm","risk mitigation","significant risk of severe harm","clients","COVID","situations","pandemic","local health care experts","overburdened health care system","brief description of risks","state","applied behavior analysis","information","staff","family","telehealth","ongoing assessment","home","Recent executive orders","jurisdiction","rare cases","active shelter","caregivers","blanket interpretation","related order","argument","article"],"language":"en"},

Negative effects on communication has been suggested when the physician wears a facemask. As communication skills and doctor patient relationship are essential to primary care consultations, the effects of doctor\u2019s facemask wearing were explored. METHOD: A randomised controlled study was conducted in primary care to explore the effects of doctors wearing facemasks on patients\u2019 perception of doctors\u2019 empathy, patient enablement and patient satisfaction. Primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. Patients\u2019 views were gathered using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure, Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and an overall satisfaction rating scale. The effects of face mask wearing were investigated using multilevel (hierarchical) modelling. RESULTS: 1,030 patients were randomised to doctor-mask wearing consultations (n = 514) and non mask wearing consultations (n = 516). A significant and negative effect was found in the patients\u2019 perception of the doctors\u2019 empathy (CARE score reduction -0.98, p-value = 0.04). In the more established doctor-patient relationship, the effect of doctors\u2019 mask wearing was more pronounced (CARE score reduction -5.67, p-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that when doctors wearing a facemask during consultations, this has a significant negative impact on the patient\u2019s perceived empathy and diminish the positive effects of relational continuity. Consideration should be taken in planning appropriate use of facemasks in infectious disease policy for primary care and other healthcare professionals at a national, local or practice level.

Here, we evaluated the impact of maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDNAs) on vaccine efficacy after PRRS virus (PRRSV) challenge. Piglets with low (A\u2212) or high (A\u002B) MDNA levels derived from a commercial pig herd were moved to experimental facilities to be vaccinated (V\u002B) or not (V\u2212) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 3 weeks of age (woa). Because of unexpectedly low vaccine detection in A\u2212V\u002B piglets post-vaccination (pv), all V\u002B piglets received a second vaccination at 4 woa. Five weeks (W5) pv, piglets were inoculated with a PRRSV-1 field strain to evaluate vaccine protection, and were mingled 24 h later with non-inoculated piglets of similar immune status to assess viral transmission. Vaccine strain was detected at W2 pv in 69% and 6% of A\u2212V\u002B and A\u002BV\u002B piglets, and at W5 pv in 50% and 25% of A\u2212V\u002B and A\u002BV\u002B piglets, respectively. At W5 pv, 94% of A\u2212V\u002B and 44% of A\u002BV\u002B piglets seroconverted, with a significant IFNg response induction in the A\u2212V\u002B group only. After challenge, compared to the V\u2212 inoculated group, viremia was 100-fold lower at 10 days post-infection in A\u2212V\u002B whereas viremia was not significantly reduced in A\u002BV\u002B piglets. A lower transmission rate was estimated for the A\u2212V\u002B group: 0.15 [0.07\u20130.29] versus 0.44 [0.18\u20131.76] and 0.32 [0.14\u20130.68] for the A\u002BV\u002B and V\u2212 groups, respectively. Investigations about the low vaccine strain detection after the first vaccination suggested a relationship between IFNa levels and vaccine strain detection in A\u2212V\u002B piglets.

Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [Image: see text]) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that [Image: see text] has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in [Image: see text], suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission.","publish_time":"2014-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blumberg, Seth; Funk, Sebastian; Pulliam, Juliet R.

This work extends our study, emphasizing the relevance of this pathway in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in vitro. During the course of infection, JUNV-infected Vero cells showed a typical cytopathic effect that may be ascribed to apoptotic cell death. Treatment of infected cultures with Ly294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, produced an apoptotic response similar to that observed for uninfected cells treated with the drug. This result suggests that virus-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway does not deliver a strong enough anti-apoptotic signal to explain the low proportion of apoptotic cells observed during infection. Also, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway during the acute stage of infection did not prevent the establishment of persistence. Furthermore, treatment of persistently JUNV-infected cells with Ly294002 did not alter viral protein expression. These findings indicate that despite the positive modulation of the PI3/Akt pathway during Jun\u00EDn virus entry, this would not play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of JUNV persistence in Vero cells.","publish_time":"2014-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linero, Florencia N.; Fern\u00E1ndez Bell-Fano, Pablo M.; Cuervo, Eugenia; Castilla, Viviana; Scolaro, Luis A.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2298-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25488290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Akt pathway","JUNV-infected cells","PI3K","survival pathway","JUNV-infected Vero cells","uninfected cells","low proportion of apoptotic cells","maintenance of JUNV persistence","Jun\u00EDn virus entry","course of infection","establishment of persistence","arenavirus Jun\u00EDn virus","maintenance of persistent infection","Ly294002","virus-induced activation","apoptotic response similar","anti-apoptotic signal","Treatment of infected cultures","acute stage of infection","apoptotic cell death","previous work","inhibitor","typical cytopathic effect","positive modulation","kinase","viral protein expression","result","critical role","relevance","phosphatidylinositol","inhibition","findings","study","drug"],"language":"en"},

Using EBNA3C amino acids 365-545 in a yeast two hybrid screen, we found an interaction with the Growth Arrest and DNA-damage protein, Gadd34. When both proteins are overexpressed, Gadd34 can interact with EBNA3C in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Amino acids 483-610 of Gadd34, including the two PP1a interaction, and the HSV-1 ICP\u03B334.5 homology domains, are required for the interaction. Furthermore, interaction is lost with a mutant of EBNA3C ((509 )DVIEVID (515)\u2192AVIAVIA), that abolishes EBNA3C coactivation ability as well as SUMO interaction[1]. In B-cells, Gadd34, and EBNA3C are present in a complex with PP1a using microcystin sepharose affinity purification, Using a lymphoblastoid cell line in which EBNA3C protein levels are conditional on hydroxytamoxifen, surprisingly, we found that (i) EBNA3C maintains phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 at serine 51, and (ii) protects against ER stress induced activation of the unfolded protein response as measured by XBP1 (u) versus XBP1(s) protein expression and N-terminal ATF6 cleavage. In reporter assays, overexpression of Gadd34 enhances EBNA3C\u0027s ability to co-activate EBNA2 activation of the LMP1 promoter. Collectively the data suggest that EBNA3C interacts with Gadd34, activating the upstream component of the UPR (eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation) while preventing downstream UPR events (XBP1 activation and ATF6 cleavage).","publish_time":"2009-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garrido, Jose L; Maruo, Seijii; Takada, Kenzo; Rosendorff, Adam","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecf15cf19a780b1f9e58e9a5b35402ca5886adab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2805635.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20040105/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant of EBNA3C","EBNA3C protein levels","EBNA3C amino acids","EBNA3C coactivation ability","nuclear protein","overexpression of Gadd34","PP1a interaction","protein expression","XBP1 activation","SUMO interaction","unfolded protein response","DNA-damage protein","EBNA2 activation","s ability","phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","ER stress induced activation","N-terminal ATF6 cleavage","downstream UPR events","proliferation of EBV infected B-lymphocytes","lymphoblastoid cell line","microcystin sepharose affinity purification","complex","Growth Arrest","upstream component","HSV","hydroxytamoxifen","LMP1 promoter","reporter assays","ICP\u03B334","yeast","homology domains","hybrid screen","AVIAVIA","cytoplasmic compartments","serine","B-cells","DVIEVID","data","proteins"],"language":"en"},

Following viral infection, autophagy is often initiated to curtail infection by delivering viral particles for lysosomal degradation and further integrating with innate pattern recognition receptor signaling to induce interferon (IFN)-mediated viral clearance. However, some viruses have evolved anti-autophagy strategies to escape host immunity and to promote viral replication. In this chapter, we illustrate how autophagy prevents viral infection to generate an optimal anti-viral milieu, and then concentrate on how viruses subvert and hijack the autophagic process to evade immunosurveillance, thereby facilitating viral replication and pathogenesis. Understanding the interplays between autophagy and viral infection is anticipated to guide the development of effective anti-viral therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Jingrong; Lin, Eena; He, Lian; Yu, Jiaming; Tan, Peng; Zhou, Yubin","journal":"Autophagy Regulation of Innate Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f75eea18b2baa316b9aab11db18654aba56d0577.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122562.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31728865/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0606-2_5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","viral replication","viral particles","viral clearance","optimal anti-viral milieu","development of effective anti-viral therapeutics","anti-autophagy strategies","viruses","orchestrating immunity","host immunity","autophagic process","intracellular recycling process","cellular homeostasis","interferon","lysosomal degradation","innate pattern recognition receptor","IFN","immunosurveillance","infectious diseases","interplays","pathogenesis","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community\u2010acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture. A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes. At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection). The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n = 67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n = 48), rhinovirus (n = 46), human metapneumovirus (n = 39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n = 38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed). The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months. Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%. Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection. It is concluded that viral coinfections are frequent in children aged less than 3 years old with community\u2010acquired pneumonia and can be a poor prognostic factor. J. Med.

However, the mechanism underlying has not been systematically evaluated, which limited their application in disease treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2212related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor in oxidative stress response related to numerous diseases, is activated after dissociating from the cytoskeleton\u2212anchored Kelch\u2212like ECH\u2212associated protein 1 (Keap1).

This study was designed to clarify whether antioxidantive phytochemicals inhibit the Keap1\u2013Nrf2 protein\u2013protein interaction and activate the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway efficiently. Molecular docking and 3D\u2212QSAR were applied to evaluate the interaction effects between 178 antioxidant phytochemicals and the Nrf2 binding site in Keap1. The Nrf2 activation effect was tested on a H2O2\u2212induced oxidative\u2212injured cell model. Results showed that the 178 phytochemicals could be divided into high\u2212, medium\u2212, and low\u2212total\u2212score groups depending on their binding affinity with Keap1, and the high\u2212total\u2212score group consisted of 24 compounds with abundant oxygen or glycosides. Meanwhile, these compounds could bind with key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1\u2212Nrf2 interface.

Because histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin\u2010embedded tissues play an important role in recognizing infectious agents in tissue samples, six in\u2010house polyclonal antibodies raised against three representative enteroviruses using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry were examined. This panel of polyclonal antibodies recognized three serotypes of enterovirus. Two of the polyclonal antibodies were raised against denatured virus particles from enterovirus A71, one was raised against the recombinant VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B3, and the other for poliovirus type 1 were raised against denatured virus particles, the recombinant VP1 protein and peptide 2C. Western blot analysis revealed that each of these antibodies recognized the corresponding viral antigen and none cross\u2010reacted with non\u2010enteroviruses within the family Picornaviridae. However, all cross\u2010reacted to some extent with the antigens derived from other serotypes of enterovirus. Indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that the virus capsid and non\u2010structural proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of affected culture cells, and skeletal muscles and neurons in neonatal mice experimentally\u2010infected with human enterovirus. The antibodies also recognized antigens derived from recent clinical isolates of enterovirus A71, coxsackievirus B3 and poliovirus. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that representative antibodies tested showed the same recognition pattern according to each serotype. Thus, the panel of in\u2010house anti\u2010enterovirus polyclonal antibodies described herein will be an important tool for the screening and pathological diagnosis for enterovirus infections, and may be useful for the classification of different enterovirus serotypes, including coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, enterovirus A71 and poliovirus.","publish_time":"2014-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotani, Osamu; Iwata\u2010Yoshikawa, Naoko; Suzuki, Tadaki; Sato, Yuko; Nakajima, Noriko; Koike, Satoshi; Iwasaki, Takuya; Sata, Tetsutaro; Yamashita, Teruo; Minagawa, Hiroko; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Hasegawa, Hideki; Shimizu, Hiroyuki; Nagata, Noriyo","journal":"Neuropathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d102f82ece520fcf2bb80fad357ce7b0fd886dbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168124.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25263613/; https://doi.org/10.1111/neup.12171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serotypes of enterovirus","human enterovirus","representative antibodies","in\u2010house polyclonal antibodies","panel of in\u2010house anti\u2010enterovirus polyclonal antibodies","panel of polyclonal antibodies","diagnosis of critical enterovirus infections","classification of different enterovirus serotypes","recent clinical isolates of enterovirus A71","immunohistochemistry","denatured virus particles","virus capsid","representative enteroviruses","recombinant VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B3","indirect immunofluorescence assay","antigens","poliovirus type","reliable method of virus detection","pathological diagnosis","important role","important tool","non\u2010enteroviruses","skeletal muscles","acute infective encephalitis","tissue samples","embedded tissues","screening","neonatal mice","infectious agents","immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin","cytoplasm of affected culture cells","neurons","coxsackieviruses","echoviruses","encephalomyelitis","myocarditis","non\u2010structural proteins","corresponding viral antigen","recognition pattern","study","family Picornaviridae","peptide","addition","Western blot analysis","extent","aim"],"language":"en"},

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are leading pediatric pathogens. However, risk factors for severe hMPV disease remain unknown. We comparatively assessed environmental, host, and viral determinants for severe hMPV and RSV infections. Methods. We studied a prospective cohort of \u003E1000 children aged \u003C3 years hospitalized in or presenting to a pediatric clinic for acute respiratory infection. We collected clinical data at enrollment and 1-month follow-up and tested nasopharyngeal secretions for respiratory viruses. Disease severity was defined as hospitalization and was also assessed with a severity score (1 point/variable) calculated on the basis of fraction of inhaled O(2) \u2265 30%, hospitalization \u003E5 days, and pediatric intensive care unit admission. Results. hMPV was identified in 58 of 305 outpatient children (19.0%) and 69 of 734 hospitalized children (9.4%), second only to RSV (48.2% and 63.6%, respectively). In multivariate regression analysis of hMPV cases, age \u003C6 months and household crowding were associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, risk factors for severe hMPV disease were female sex, prematurity, and genotype B infection. Age \u003C6 months, comorbidities, and household crowding were risk factors for RSV hospitalization; breast-feeding and viral coinfection were protective. Age \u003C6 months and prematurity were associated with severe RSV cases among hospitalized children. Conclusions. hMPV and RSV severity risk factors may differ slightly.

We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing. Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it.

Inovirus display studies have shown that the architecture of inoviruses makes all coat proteins of the inoviral particle accessible to the outside. This particular feature of IAVs allows foreign antigenic peptides to be displayed on the outer surface of the virion fused to its coat proteins and for more than two decades has been exploited in many applications including antibody or peptide display libraries, drug design, and vaccine development against infectious and non-infectious diseases. As vaccine carriers, IAVs have been shown to elicit both a cellular and humoral response against various pathogens through the display of antibody epitopes on their coat proteins. Despite their high immunogenicity, the goal of developing an effective vaccine against HIV-1 has not yet materialized. One possible limitation of previous efforts was the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which exhibited autoreactivity properties. In the past five years, however, new, more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies that do not exhibit autoreactivity properties have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, suggesting that vaccination strategies aimed at producing such broadly neutralizing antibodies may confer protection against infection. The utilization of these new, broadly neutralizing antibodies in combination with the architectural traits of IAVs have driven the current developments in the design of an inovirus-based vaccine against HIV-1.

Currently, there are no guidelines recommending HPV oral cavity screening as a mandatory test, and it remains unknown which HPV types should be included in HPV screening programs. Our goal was to assess HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal, anal, and cervical swabs using different sets of primers,which are able to amplify \u03B1, \u03B2, \u03B3 HPV types. METHODS: We analysed the presence of HPV DNA in oropharyngeal (n = 124), anal (n = 186), cervical specimens (n = 43) from HIV positive and negative patients using FAP59/64 and MY09/11 primers. All untyped strains were genetically characterized through PCR amplification and direct sequencing of partial L1 region, and the resulting sequences were classified through phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: HPV prevalence was 20.9% in 124 oropharyngeal swab samples, including infections with multiple HPV types (5.6%). HPV prevalence in this anatomical site was significantly associated with serostatus: 63.3%in HIV positive and 36.3% in HIV negative patients (p \u003C 0.05). Unclassified types were detected in 6 specimens. In our analysis, we did not observe any difference in HPV (\u03B1, \u03B2, \u03B3) prevalence between men and women. Overall, \u03B2 species were the most frequently detected 69.7%. When using anal swabs, for HIV positive patients, \u03B2 genus prevalence was 1% and \u03B3 genus was 3.7% including 6 unclassified types. In cervical samples from 43 HIV positive women (18 HPV negative and 25 positive by MY09/11 PCR), only one sample was positivite for \u03B2(1) species (2.4%) using FAP primers. Six of the untyped strains clustered with sequences from species 7, 9, 10, 8,12 of \u03B3 genus. Four sequences remained unclassified. Finally, \u03B2 and \u03B3 HPV prevalence was significantly lower than their respective HPV prevalence as identified by the Luminex system in all anatomical sites that were analyzed in previous studies. CONCLUSION: This study provides new information about viral isolates present in oropharyngeal site and it will contribute to improve the monitoring of HPV infection.

Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions and lack of antiviral drug, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for HCoV. In this study, a computational approach was adopted to identify a multiepitope vaccine candidate against this virus that could be suitable to trigger a significant immune response. Sequences of the spike proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool, to identify the most immunogenic protein. Both T cell immunity and B cell immunity were checked for the peptides to ensure that they had the capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The peptide sequence from 88\u201394 amino acids and the sequence KSSTGFVYF were found as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes, respectively. Furthermore, conservancy analysis was also done using in silico tools and showed a conservancy of 64.29% for all epitopes. The peptide sequence could interact with as many as 16 human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and showed high cumulative population coverage, ranging from 75.68% to 90.73%.

As learned from past incidents, the detrimental impact grows exponentially without effective quarantine. Therefore, rapid on-site detection and analysis are highly desired. In addition, for high-risk areas of viral contamination, close monitoring should be provided during the potential disease incubation period. As the epidemic progresses, a response protocol needs tobe rapidly implemented and the virus evolution fully tracked. For these scenarios, point-of-care microdevices can provide sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost analysis for a large population, especially in handling complex patient samples, such as blood, urine and saliva. Blood plasma can be considered as a mine of information containing sources and clues of biomarkers, including nucleic acids, immunoglobulin and other proteins, as well as pathogens for clinical diagnosis. However, blood plasma is also the most complicated body fluid. For targeted plasma biomarker detection or untargeted plasma biomarker discovery, the challenges can be as difficult as identifying a needle in a haystack. A useful platform must not only pursue single performance characteristics, but also excel at multiple performance parameters, such as speed, accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, cost, portability, reliability, and user friendliness.

Hypericin (HY) is an excellent compound that has been investigated in antiviral, antineoplastic, and antidepressant. To investigate the inhibition effect of HY on IBV infection in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells, 3 different experimental designs: pre-treatment of cells prior to IBV infection, direct treatment of IBV-infected cells, and pre-treatment of IBV prior to cell infection were used. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy were performed and virus titer was determined by TCID50. The results revealed that HY had a good anti-IBV effect when HY directly treated the IBV-infected cells, and virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HY inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis in CEK cells, and significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, and significantly increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression level in CEK cells. In addition, HY treatment could decrease IBV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in CEK cells. These results suggested that HY showed potential antiviral activities against IBV infection involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK cells.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Huijie; Feng, Rui; Muhammad, Ishfaq; Abbas, Ghulam; Zhang, Yue; Ren, Yudong; Huang, Xiaodan; Zhang, Ruili; Diao, Lei; Wang, Xiurong; Li, Guangxing","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f48acaa9b87ab31e2be26149983fd243c4a9be6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107269.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119579433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399732/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119579433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","CEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV infection","IBV-infected cells","CEK cells","pre-treatment of IBV","pre-treatment of cells","HY treatment","HY inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis","direct treatment of IBV","inhibition effect of HY","good anti-IBV effect","cell infection","inhibition of apoptosis","ROS generation","virus infectivity","virus titer","Caspase","results","ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis virus","qRT-PCR","mRNA expression levels of Fas","potential antiviral activities","Quantitative real-time PCR","FasL","chicken embryo kidney","enormous economic loss","different experimental designs","flow cytometry","immunofluorescence assay","reactive oxygen species","IFA","JNK","fluorescence microscopy","Bax","increased Bcl","poultry industry","coronavirus","dose-dependent manner","excellent compound","addition","antidepressant","TCID50","Hypericin"],"language":"en"},

Zymogens are usually activated by proteolytic cleavage. Many viruses encode proteases that execute key proteolytic steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a proof of concept for a therapeutic approach to fighting viral infections through eradication of virally infected cells exclusively, thus limiting virus production and spread. Using the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model, we designed two HCV NS3 protease-activated \u201Czymogenized\u201D chimeric toxins (which we denote \u201Czymoxins\u201D). In these recombinant constructs, the bacterial and plant toxins diphtheria toxin A (DTA) and Ricin A chain (RTA), respectively, were fused to rationally designed inhibitor peptides/domains via an HCV NS3 protease-cleavable linker. The above toxins were then fused to the binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A in order to enable translocation into the mammalian cells cytoplasm. We show that these toxins exhibit NS3 cleavage dependent increase in enzymatic activity upon NS3 protease cleavage in vitro. Moreover, a higher level of cytotoxicity was observed when zymoxins were applied to NS3 expressing cells or to HCV infected cells, demonstrating a potential therapeutic window. The increase in toxin activity correlated with NS3 protease activity in the treated cells, thus the therapeutic window was larger in cells expressing recombinant NS3 than in HCV infected cells. This suggests that the \u201Czymoxin\u201D approach may be most appropriate for application to life-threatening acute infections where much higher levels of the activating protease would be expected.","publish_time":"2011-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shapira, Assaf; Gal-Tanamy, Meital; Nahary, Limor; Litvak-Greenfeld, Dana; Zemel, Romy; Tur-Kaspa, Ran; Benhar, Itai","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80ea83eb20c374075380eadb6df930f2d356ea62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3021518.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0015916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21264238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS3 protease activity","NS3 protease cleavage","HCV infected cells","recombinant NS3","treated cells","HCV NS3 protease-cleavable linker","toxins exhibit NS3 cleavage dependent increase","mammalian cells cytoplasm","activating protease","toxin activity","therapeutic approach","proteolytic cleavage","chimeric toxins","enzymatic activity","viral infections","plant toxins diphtheria toxin","potential therapeutic window","zymoxins","zymogens","translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin","higher levels","recombinant constructs","virus production","life-threatening acute infections","key proteolytic steps","viral life cycle","higher level of cytotoxicity","hepatitis C virus","designed inhibitor peptides","DTA","desirable time","execution of selected catalytic activities","order","application","binding","eradication","Ricin","proteases","model","synthesis of inactive enzyme precursors","chain","mechanism","viruses","proof of concept","RTA","site"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) towards respiratory tract infections (RTIs) prevention among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims. METHODS: This study was conducted among Malaysian Umrah pilgrims in Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan. The questionnaire then underwent a series of validation process that included content, face validity and exploratory part. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was utilized for the validation of the knowledge domain. The attitude and practice were validated using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA). RESULTS: The validation process resulted in a questionnaire that comprised of four main sections: demography, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Following IRT analysis of the knowledge domain, all items analyzed were within the acceptable range of difficulty and discrimination. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) was 0.72 and 0.84 for attitude and practice domain respectively and Bartlett\u2019s test of Sphericity for both domains were highly significant (P \u003C 0.001). The factor analysis resulted in two factors with total of 12 items in attitude domain, and 2 factors with total of 13 items in the practice domain with satisfactory factor loading (\u003E 0.3). The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for reliability of the knowledge, attitude and practice domains all showed acceptable values of \u003E 0.6 (0.92, 0.77 and 0.85). CONCLUSION: The findings of this validation and reliability study showed that the developed questionnaire had a satisfactory psychometric property for measuring KAP of Malaysian Hajj pilgrims.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goni, Mohammed Dauda; Naing, Nyi Nyi; Hasan, Habsah; Wan-Arfah, Nadiah; Deris, Zakuan Zainy; Arifin, Wan Nor; Hussin, Tengku Mohammad Ariff Raja; Abdulrahman, Abdulwali Sabo; Baaba, Aisha Abubakar; Arshad, Muhammad Rafie","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7050115.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32114986/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-8269-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartlett"],"organizations":["KAP","IRT"],"locations":["Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur"],"keyphrases":["attitude domain","knowledge domain","practice domains","items","IRT analysis","exploratory factor analysis","KAP of Malaysian Hajj pilgrims","developed questionnaire","reliability study","satisfactory factor","Malaysian Umrah pilgrims","series of validation process","Hajj pilgrimage","total","factors","respiratory tract infections","prevention strategies","acceptable values","high prevalence of respiratory tract infection","satisfactory psychometric property","acceptable range of difficulty","RTIs","numerous challenges","content","Olkin measure of sampling adequacy","Kuala Lumpur","Bartlett\u2019s test of Sphericity","face validity","main sections","Kaiser-Meyer","KMO","BACKGROUND","Item response theory","findings","demography","Kelantan","discrimination","Cronbach\u2019s alpha","EFA","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","aim","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Methods and Results: Suspensions with poliovirus Sabin1, adenovirus type5, parechovirus1, human norovirus (NoV) GII.4, murine NoV (MNV1) and human influenza A (H1N1) viruses were heated at 56 and 73\u00B0C. Infectivity was tested by culture assay for all but human NoV GII.4 that cannot be cultivated in vitro. Time to first log(10) reduction (TFL\u2010value) was calculated based on best fit using the monophasic, biphasic or Weibull models. The Weibull model provided the best fit at 56\u00B0C for all viruses except influenza virus. The TFL at 56\u00B0C varied between a high of 27 min (parechovirus) to a low of 10 s (adenovirus) and ranked parechovirus \u003E influenza \u003E MNV1 \u003E poliovirus \u003E adenovirus. The monophasic model best described the behaviour of the viruses at 73\u00B0C, in which case the TFL was MNV1(62s) \u003E influenza \u003E adenovirus \u003E parechovirus \u003E poliovirus(14s). Conclusions: Viruses do not follow log\u2010linear thermal inactivation kinetics and the thermostability of parechovirus and influenza virus is similar to that of proven foodborne viruses. Significance and Impact of the Study: Resistant fractions of viruses may remain infectious in thermal inactivation processes and inactivation of newly discovered or enveloped viruses in thermal food preparation processes should not be assumed without further testing.","publish_time":"2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuladhar, E.; Bouwknegt, M.; Zwietering, M.H.; Koopmans, M.; Duizer, E.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ca3263f48987e4ecf8cb9241fa21fb82bd60322.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197747.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22404161/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05282.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TFL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different viruses","enveloped viruses","human influenza","proven foodborne viruses","influenza virus","Resistant fractions of viruses","thermal inactivation processes","MNV1","TFL","thermal stability","adenovirus type5","thermostability of parechovirus","best fit","linear thermal inactivation kinetics","thermal food preparation processes","poliovirus Sabin1","human norovirus","log","monophasic model","GII","food safety","Weibull models","Suspensions","potential relevance","parechovirus1","Study","Impact","Results","culture assay","comparative data","Methods","reduction","value","behaviour","H1N1","Infectivity","Significance","Conclusions","Time","testing"],"language":"en"},

Viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are typically spared in this process, but the mechanisms of target selectivity during host shutoff remain poorly understood. Using transcriptome-wide and targeted reporter experiments, we demonstrate that the influenza A virus endoribonuclease PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. Proximity-labeling proteomics reveals that PA-X interacts with cellular RNA processing proteins, some of which are partially required for host shutoff. Thus, PA-X taps into host nuclear pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to destroy nascent mRNAs shortly after their synthesis. This mechanism sets PA-X apart from other viral host shutoff proteins that target actively translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Our study reveals a unique mechanism of host shutoff that helps us understand how influenza viruses suppress host gene expression.","publish_time":"2019-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaucherand, Lea; Porter, Brittany K.; Levene, Rachel E.; Price, Emma L.; Schmaling, Summer K.; Rycroft, Chris H.; Kevorkian, Yuzo; McCormick, Craig; Khaperskyy, Denys A.; Gaglia, Marta M.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ae1cad5b20badf8dcea32e8c80209b8948d1e49.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c39ece828769a97d7ab743e5bae232bc127ae6a3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b9f0339c259fab0767ec537424e539fdd49252a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6499400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719303936; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124719303936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","host RNAs","viral host shutoff proteins","host gene expression","unique mechanism of host shutoff","Viral proteins","host nuclear pre-mRNA processing mechanisms","virus endoribonuclease PA-X","cellular RNA processing proteins","influenza viruses","viral replication","mechanisms of target selectivity","nascent mRNAs","translating mRNAs","targeted reporter experiments","transcriptome-wide","antiviral responses","Proximity-labeling proteomics","study","synthesis","cytoplasm","destruction"],"language":"en"},

Intestinal dysbiosis associated with these environmental influences, as well as some host-related factors, compromises immune responses and negatively impacts vaccine efficacy. To understand how immune responses to viral vaccines can be optimally modulated, mechanistic studies of the relationship between the microbiome, host genetics, viral infections and the development and function of the immune system are needed.

Social media platforms have been explored as a research recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for collecting representative survey data during infectious disease epidemics remain unexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study has two aims 1) describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these challenges. METHODS: An original web-based survey informed by evidence from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20\u201330, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisement\u2019s reach and response trends. RESULTS: In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%. CONCLUSIONS: The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didn\u2019t, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Shahmir H.; Foreman, Joshua; Capasso, Ariadna; Jones, Abbey M.; Tozan, Yesim; DiClemente, Ralph J.","journal":"BMC Med Res Methodol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26142303160f89f4c1d87bbc2859ed0febf75afd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220591.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01011-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","U.S.","Puerto Rico"],"keyphrases":["COVID","representative survey data","social media advertisement campaign","use of social media recruitment","nationwide data","rapid collection of survey data","Social media platforms","recruitment platform","day of recruitment","male responses","public health data","research recruitment tool","online Qualtrics survey","supplementary male","Facebook advertisement campaign","original web-based survey","evolving health crises","impactful health crises","challenges","cumulative percentage of male respondents","future research","participant responses","advertisement\u2019s reach","United States","preliminary findings","response trends","Total cost","nationwide sample of adults","racial minority- targeted advertisements","evidence","compelling researchers","modern history","large scale","efficient strategy","innovative ways","infectious disease epidemics","White-oriented gender","past literature","ethnic-skewing","issues of disproportionate female","validated scales","District of Columbia","settings","link","timely manner","knowledge","feasibility","CONCLUSIONS","Puerto Rico","METHODS","beliefs","representation","interventions","representativeness","strategies","short time period","proportion of men","practices","individuals","clicks","RESULTS","methodology","BACKGROUND","pandemic","Implementation","OBJECTIVES","study","surveys","costs"],"language":"en"},

The risk of acquisition and transmission of influenza among Hajj pilgrims is high. Therefore, influenza vaccination is recommended, and was monitored frequently among pilgrims from different countries. However, the vaccination uptake among Saudi pilgrims has not been assessed in recent years. Objective This analysis aims to evaluate influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi Hajj pilgrims, and identify the key barriers to vaccination. Method Data on influenza vaccination were obtained from Saudi pilgrims who took part in a large trial during the Hajj of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Pilgrims were met and recruited in Mina, Makkah during the peak period of Hajj and were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire that recorded their influenza vaccination history, including reason(s) for non-receipt of vaccine. Results A total of 6974 Saudi pilgrims aged between 18 and 95 (median 34) years were recruited; male to female ratio was 1:1.2. Of the total, 90.8% declared their influenza vaccination history, 51.3% of them reported receiving influenza vaccine before travel to Hajj. The vaccination rates for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 21.4%, 48.2% and 58.1%, respectively (P \u003C 0.001). Of 1,269 pilgrims who were at higher risk of severe disease, 54.5% received the vaccine. Lack of awareness (47.5%), reliance on natural immunity (15.8%) and being busy (15.5%) were the main reasons for non-receipt. Conclusion These data from a convenience sample indicate that influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi Hajj pilgrims is increasing over years but still needs further improvement. Lack of awareness and misperceptions are the main barriers. Education of Saudi pilgrims and health professionals is required to raise awareness about influenza vaccination. Further studies are needed to understand pilgrims\u2019 misperceptions.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfelali, Mohammad; Barasheed, Osamah; Badahdah, Al-Mamoon; Bokhary, Hamid; Azeem, Mohammed I.; Habeebullah, Turki; Bakarman, Marwan; Asghar, Atif; Booy, Robert; Rashid, Harunor","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab9b55622000b16a4bfe72d25bd29c500f1d5177.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115686.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18303438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29555221/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18303438; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["Saudi Hajj pilgrims","influenza vaccination history","Education of Saudi pilgrims","influenza vaccine uptake","vaccination uptake","transmission of influenza","receiving influenza vaccine","vaccination rates","Saudi Arabia","Abstract Background Hajj","peak period of Hajj","non-receipt of vaccine","Lack of awareness","recent years","Makkah","main barriers","total","risk of acquisition","key barriers","main reasons","Method Data","pilgrims\u2019 misperceptions","higher risk of severe disease","convenience sample","world\u2019s largest annual mass","religious assemblage","health professionals","globe","Mina","analysis","travel","baseline questionnaire","Conclusion","reliance","female ratio","large trial","natural immunity","studies","Objective","different countries","Muslims","improvement"],"language":"en"},

It is used by weaker sections of society, such as marginal farmers as insurance against crop failure, for ready cash and to ensure basic economic returns and the empowerment of women and children. However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified. The pattern of virulence gene specially associated with urinary tract infection and antibiotic resistance genes, such as extended spectrum \u03B2 lactamase (ESBL) genes of the isolates was studied.

Previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway, which would normally elicit a robust IFN response, but the mechanism(s) used by SARS PLpro to inhibit activation of the IRF3 pathway is not fully known. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how SARS PLpro efficiently inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway. We found that expression of the membrane-anchored PLpro domain (PLpro-TM) from SARS-CoV inhibits STING/TBK1/IKK\u03B5-mediated activation of type I IFNs and disrupts the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, which are activated by STING and TBK1. Meanwhile, we showed that PLpro-TM physically interacts with TRAF3, TBK1, IKK\u03B5, STING, and IRF3, the key components that assemble the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex for activation of IFN expression. However, the interaction between the components in STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex is disrupted by PLpro-TM. Furthermore, SARS PLpro-TM reduces the levels of ubiquitinated forms of RIG-I, STING, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 in the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex. These results collectively point to a new mechanism used by SARS-CoV through which PLpro negatively regulates IRF3 activation by interaction with STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex, yielding a SARS-CoV countermeasure against host innate immunity.","publish_time":"2014-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaojuan; Yang, Xingxing; Zheng, Yang; Yang, Yudong; Xing, Yaling; Chen, Zhongbin","journal":"Protein Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97a3bb18c51244482cb68d5565389266a0cb7098.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3996160.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-014-0026-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS PLpro-TM","STING-TRAF3","IRF3 activation","TBK1 complex","SARS-CoV countermeasure","SARS-CoV papain","SARS coronavirus","IRF3 pathway","dimerization of IRF3","activation of IFN expression","membrane-anchored PLpro domain","IKK\u03B5-mediated activation of type","new mechanism","novel mechanism","antagonistic mechanism","interaction","robust IFN response","key components","IFNs","levels of ubiquitinated forms of RIG","protease","host innate immunity","phosphorylation","Previous studies","antiviral activities of interferon","study","results"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network. Methods We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network. Findings We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18\u00B74%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13\u00B73%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1\u00B755, 95% CI 1\u00B727\u20131\u00B789). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40\u201364 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18\u00B75%] of 1316 adults aged 40\u201364 years vs 23 [4\u00B76%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5\u00B736, 95% CI 3\u00B728\u20138\u00B776). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15\u00B75%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62\u00B71%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4\u00B775, 95% CI 2\u00B765\u20138\u00B751). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26\u00B72%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5\u00B76%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4\u00B759, 95% CI 3\u00B757\u20135\u00B790) and in more deprived areas (197 [29\u00B75%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7\u00B77%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2\u00B703, 95% CI 1\u00B751\u20132\u00B771) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32\u00B79%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14\u00B74%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1\u00B791, 95% CI 1\u00B731\u20132\u00B778), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20\u00B79%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13\u00B72%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1\u00B741, 95% CI 1\u00B704\u20131\u00B791). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11\u00B74%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17\u00B79%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0\u00B749, 95% CI 0\u00B734\u20130\u00B771). Interpretation A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.

The complete genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has since been sequenced. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. To determine if the N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular signal transduction, an ELISA-based assay on transcription factors was used. We found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c-Fos, ATF2, CREB-1, and FosB was increased by the expression of SARS-CoV N. Since these factors are related to AP-1 signal transduction pathway, we investigated whether the AP-1 pathway was activated by SARS-CoV N protein using the PathDetect system. The results demonstrated that the expression of N protein, not the membrane protein (M), activated AP-1 pathway. We also found that SARS-CoV N protein does not activate NF-\u03BAB pathway, demonstrating that activation of important cellular pathways by SAS-CoV N protein is selective. Thus our data for the first time indicate that SARS-CoV has encoded a strategy to regulate cellular signaling process.","publish_time":"2003-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Runtao; Leeson, Andrew; Andonov, Anton; Li, Yan; Bastien, Nathalie; Cao, Jingxin; Osiowy, Carla; Dobie, Frederick; Cutts, Todd; Ballantine, Melissa; Li, Xuguang","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a80a4e89e167e2d9c934e32f7bce7a5cabe3501a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111052.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X03021545; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X03021545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV N protein","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","SARS coronavirus","expression of SARS","SAS-CoV N protein","expression of N protein","membrane protein","signal transduction pathway","transcription factors","regulation of cellular signal transduction","novel coronavirus","NF-\u03BAB pathway","coronavirus family","activation of important cellular pathways","ELISA-based assay","promoter sequences of c","little homology","severe acute respiratory syndrome","disease","CREB","ATF2","patients","members","strategy","PathDetect system","complete genome","time","atypical pneumonia","causative agent","FosB","process","results","Abstract","data"],"language":"en"},

Naturally recombinant IBVs originating from the GI-13 and GI-19 lineages have also been isolated from chicken flocks with respiratory and renal problems in China. Thorough genetic and biological investigations of these recombinant viruses have led to speculation regarding their origin, evolution, and control. In order to confirm the previous results and further extend our understanding about the characteristics of the four recombinant IBV strains we had previously identified (I0718/17, I0722/17, I0724/17, and I0737/17), we conducted phylogenetic analysis by comparing their complete S1 gene sequences with those of 71 reference strains of different genotypes and lineages. We identified a close relationship between the S1 sequences of the four strains and those of GI-13 strains. The results of complete genome sequence analysis confirmed the previously identified recombination events in the four IBV strains and revealed additional recombination events in different genomic regions of strains I0718/17 and I0724/17, suggesting that the two strains originated from multiple recombination events between 4/91-like and YX10-like viruses. We comparatively evaluated the antigenicity, pathogenicity, and affinity of the four recombinant viruses and their deduced parental strains in the trachea and kidneys. Some of the strains showed comparable antigenic relatedness, pathogenicity, and affinity for the trachea and kidneys among each other and with their parental viruses; however, some of them showed varying biological characteristics. Point mutations observed in the receptor-binding domain and hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the spike protein likely have an effect on these differences in biological characteristics, although the influence of other factors\u2014such as host innate-immune responses and changes in genomic regions beyond the S1 protein\u2014might also be responsible for such changes.","publish_time":"2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Liwen; Ren, Mengting; Sheng, Jie; Ma, Tianxin; Han, Zongxi; Zhao, Yan; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0fadc5ddc284f02c93cf8df1e63f015ab8b03a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185608.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021830683X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.01.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021830683X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30641197/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["IBV strains","recombinant viruses","deduced parental strains","parental viruses","different genomic regions of strains I0718","reference strains of different genotypes","S1 sequences","S1 protein","identified recombination events","recombinant IBVs","lineages","S1 subunit","additional recombination events","multiple recombination events","varying biological characteristics","Infectious bronchitis viruses","complete S1 gene sequences","affinity","biological investigations","pathogenicity","changes","trachea","China","kidneys","I0724","results of complete genome sequence analysis","phylogenetic analysis","spike protein","previous results","hypervariable region","receptor-binding domain","renal problems","immune responses","effect","chicken flocks","comparable antigenic relatedness","host","speculation","origin","evolution","understanding","close relationship","influence","differences","QX","LX4","control","factors","mutations","recent years","order","I0722","antigenicity","YX10","I0737"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 fecal swabs were collected from clinically infected domestic dogs of 2-5 months of age, suspected to suffer from CPV infection, from Cairo and Giza Governorates. The samples were subjected to qualitative antigen detection using the rapid test, followed by isolation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, molecular characterization with partial amplification of VP2 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Out of 50 fecal samples, 20 samples were positive (40%) by Rapid CPV/canine coronavirus Ag Test Kit. These positive samples were cultured successfully on MDCK cells. Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The obtained strains were submitted to GenBank and given accession numbers MK642272, MK642273, MK642274, MK642275, MK642276, and MK642277.

However, the details of how these pathological features unfold in severe influenza infections remain unclear. Accumulation of Gr1 \u002B CD11b \u002B myeloid cells has been observed in highly pathogenic influenza infections but it is not clear how and why they accumulate in the severely inflamed lung. In this study, we selected this cell population as a target to investigate the extreme inflammatory response during severe influenza infection. RESULTS: We established H1N1 IAV-infected mouse models using three viruses of varying pathogenicity and noted the accumulation of a defined Gr1 \u002B CD11b \u002B myeloid population correlating with the pathogenicity. Herein, we reported that CCR2\u002B inflammatory monocytes are the major cell compartments in this population. Of note, impaired clearance of the high pathogenicity virus prolonged IFN expression, leading to CCR2\u002B inflammatory monocytes amplifying their own recruitment via an interferon-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor 1 (IFNAR1)-triggered chemokine loop. Blockage of IFNAR1-triggered signaling or inhibition of viral replication by Oseltamivir significantly suppresses the expression of CCR2 ligands and reduced the influx of CCR2\u002B inflammatory monocytes. Furthermore, trafficking of CCR2\u002B inflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow to the lung was evidenced by a CCR2-dependent chemotaxis. Importantly, leukocyte infiltration, cytokine storm and expression of iNOS were significantly reduced in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice lacking infiltrating CCR2\u002B inflammatory monocytes, enhancing the survival of the infected mice.

Only one BAL per patient was included. We compared the rate of positive PCR testing to conventional testing. We then investigated factors associated with positive PCR testing. Finally, we assessed for changes in antimicrobial therapy after bronchoscopy. Results Three hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent BAL with 249 patients having pneumocystis PCR testing and 142 having viral PCR testing. Pneumocystis identification occurred in 43 patients and viral species identification occurred in 56 patients. PCR testing increased pneumocystis identification compared to microscopy, 14% vs. 5%, p = 0.01, and viral identification compared to culture, 25% vs. 6%, p = 0.0001. Of the patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing 49% had antibiotics stopped, 66% were started on anti-pneumocystis therapy, and only 6% did not receive treatment. There was no difference in the number of patients with antibiotics stopped based on viral PCR testing results. Discussion PCR testing increases BAL yield in immunosuppressed patients compared to conventional testing. Pneumocystis identified by PCR only may cause a self-limited infection and may not require antimicrobial therapy. PCR testing should be included in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lachant, Daniel J.; Croft, Daniel P.; McGrane Minton, Heather; Hardy, Dwight J.; Prasad, Paritosh; Kottmann, R.

In this report, we study the chronological order of genotypic changes in the spike protein of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) during its adaptation to a primate cell line. Adaptation of the Beaudette strain of IBV from chicken embryo to Vero cells showed the accumulation of 49 amino acid mutations. Among them, 26 (53.06%) substitutions were located in the S protein. Sequencing analysis and comparison of the S gene demonstrated that the majority of the mutations were accumulated and fixed at passage 7 on Vero cells and minor variants were isolated in several passages. Evidence present suggests that the dominant Vero cell-adapted IBV strain may be derived from the chicken embryo passages by selection of and potential recombination between the minor variants. This may explain why adaptation is a rapid process and the dominant strain, once adapted to a new host cell, becomes relatively stable.","publish_time":"2005-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Shou Guo; Shen, Shuo; Tay, Felicia P.L.; Liu, D.

Recently, several outbreaks of ECoV infection have also been reported in adult horses from the USA, France and Japan. Epidemiological studies of ECoV infection are still limited, and the seroprevalence of ECoV infection in Europe is unknown. In this study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method utilizing ECoV spike S1 protein was developed in two formats, and further validated by analyzing 27 paired serum samples (acute and convalescent sera) from horses involved in an ECoV outbreak and 1084 sera of horses with unknown ECoV exposure. Both formats showed high diagnostic accuracy compared to virus neutralization (VN) assay. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine the best cut-off values for both ELISA formats, assuming a test specificity of 99%. Employing the developed ELISA method, we detected seroconversion in 70.4% of horses from an ECoV outbreak. Among the 1084 horse sera, seropositivity varied from 25.9% (young horses) to 82.8% (adult horses) in Dutch horse populations. Further, sera of Icelandic horses were included in this study and a significant number of sera (62%) were found to be positive. Overall, the results demonstrated that the ECoV S1-based ELISA has reliable diagnostic performance compared to the VN assay and is a useful assay to support seroconversion in horses involved with ECoV outbreaks and to estimate ECoV seroprevalence in populations of horses.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shan; Smits, Constance; Schuurman, Nancy; Barnum, Samantha; Pusterla, Nicola; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Bosch, Berend-Jan; van Maanen, Kees; Egberink, Herman","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dafc5a833630d362e8ac97ce094a669204ef62e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6950238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801275/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11121109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VN"],"locations":["France","Japan","Europe"],"keyphrases":["sera of horses","ECoV seroprevalence","ECoV outbreaks","adult horses","populations of horses","seroprevalence of ECoV infection","outbreaks of ECoV infection","sera of Icelandic horses","young horses","unknown ECoV exposure","ECoV S1-based ELISA","Epidemiological studies of ECoV infection","ECoV spike S1 protein","ELISA formats","horse sera","VN assay","convalescent sera","developed ELISA method","useful assay","significant number of sera","seroconversion","study","Dutch horse populations","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","reliable diagnostic performance","high diagnostic accuracy","virus neutralization","paired serum samples","best cut-off values","analyses","USA","France","Europe","Receiver-operating characteristic","seropositivity","test specificity","enteric diseases","foals","Japan","Equine coronavirus","results"],"language":"en"},

Close surveillance of outbreaks and herd immunity are also at the forefront, even in industrialized countries, where previously eradicated viruses are now at risk of re-emergence due to instances of strain recombination, contractions in viral vector geographies, and from their potential use as agents of bioterrorism. There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monette, Anne; Mouland, Andrew J.","journal":"International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/133024fd511290554bcd6866e7401cb073d05cfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104940.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.07.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644818300844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635091/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644818300844","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated disorders","viral disorders","emerging viruses","eradicated viruses","herd immunity","gold standard of immunity","severe lethal disorders","vaccination choices","associated syndromes","unpredictable outbreaks","large outbreaks","Close surveillance of outbreaks","prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity","long-lived effector memory T cell subsets","adaptive immune effector memory T cells","viral vector geographies","conferred vaccination immunogenicity","long-lived protection","strong focus","host-immune evasion strategies","Abstract Continuous epidemiological surveillance of existing","hepatic","rational design of current","tropism","instances of strain recombination","contractions","epidemiology","quantifying","proliferating","result of increased travel","future vaccines","steady shift","high morbidity","wide variety of pathogens","transmission","light","potential use","health risks","risk of re-emergence","mortality rates","skin","abilities","replication","forefront","industrialized countries","importance","great need","natural infection","agents of bioterrorism","hemorrhagic fevers","malignancies","trends","vaccinology"],"language":"en"},

He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any \u201Dnormal\u201D post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schweitzer, Wolf; Ruder, Thomas; Baumeister, Rilana; Bolliger, Stephan; Thali, Michael; Meixner, Eva; Ampanozi, Garyfalia","journal":"Forensic Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9a490e905cccca5dea8621d6ae9c93d5a6ea559.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fri.2020.200378; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666225620300270; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666225620300270","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Swiss case","SARS-COV","forensic control case","Abstract Case details","post-mortem CT","post-mortem testing","outpatient","PMCT findings","post-mortem finding","pandemic impact of SARS","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","acute tubular necrosis","acute liver dystrophy","question","pulmonary progression","pulmonary CT","visualization of post-mortem computed tomography","aerated lung regions","lungs","reported symptoms","context of COVID","comparison","typical findings of COVID","extensive pathology","focus","binuclear lymphocytes","under-reported symptomatic patients","screening high-risk patients","precise medicolegal investigations","nasopharyngeal swabs","slow progression","sensitive testing","lung changes","D-visualization","possible symptoms","remarkable pathology","non-specific picture of ARDS","extensive face mask policies","year old HIV-positive man","black swan","underestimated fat tails","final rapid escalation","features","example","measures","prolonged circulation","hospital","late medical consultation","intensive-care treatment","technical reason","view of risk assessment","epidemiology","infectious disease","everyday life","infection","addition","discriminating correlates","deterioration","super-spreaders","apparent extreme single observations","stakeholders","policy","home","search","kidneys","weeks","range of issues","coronary artery atherosclerosis","specific extra tests","heart","order","Comment","sample","days","inflammation","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Besides, hygiene related factors such as the public health measures by the government and possible personal awareness in the community can also affect the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. However, there is no quantitative support for this conclusion, because of lack of quality data. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered strict public health measures and personal awareness in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases, providing us an opportunity to quantify the impact of hygiene related factors in the spread of the disease. In this paper, we model the number of the respiratory illnesses by a semiparametric model which models the environmental and weather impacts using a multiple index model and the impact of other public health measures and possible personal awareness using a growth curve with jump. Using data from Hong Kong, we found that public health measures contributed to about 39% of reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses during the SARS period. However, the impact of hygienically related factors eventually fades as time passes. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the usefulness of governmental campaigns to arouse the awareness of the public in staying away from transmission of respiratory diseases during the full outbreak of the disease. The results also show the fast fading of alertness of Hong Kong people towards the epidemic. Furthermore, our model also offers a way to model the impacts of environmental factors on respiratory diseases, when the data contains the effect of human intervention, by introducing the change point and growth curve to remove such an effect.","publish_time":"2012-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Heung; Shao, Quanxi; Ip, Wai-cheung","journal":"Comput Stat Data Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/240e46fee53fef1e863874f1207dc7b9dd30e25e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185837.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167947312003039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947312003039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362698/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2012.07.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["transmission of respiratory diseases","number of respiratory illnesses","spread of infectious respiratory diseases","prevention of infectious respiratory diseases","impact of hygiene related factors","possible personal awareness","triggered strict public health measures","semiparametric model","severe acute respiratory syndrome","impacts of environmental factors","multiple index model","weather impacts","outbreak","growth curve","lack of quality data","results","Hong Kong people","indirect quantitative support","weather conditions","SARS period","ambient air quality","effect of human intervention","fast fading of alertness","conclusion","usefulness of governmental campaigns","change point","community","opportunity","epidemic","jump","way","reduction","time","paper"],"language":"en"},

Live attenuated vaccines are traditionally generated by serial passage of a virulent strain in embryonated chicken eggs; however, the molecular mechanism of attenuation is unknown. M41-CK, a virulent lab-adapted strain of IBV, was egg passaged over 100 times in four parallel independent replicates. All four final egg-passaged viruses were attenuated in vivo and exhibited similar growth phenotypes in adult chicken kidney cells and ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. The virus populations were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing at the end of passaging, and the results showed that overall sequence diversity in the IBV population increased but the four replicates only had between 11 and 17 consensus-level single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although hot spots of variation were identified in spike and nucleocapsid structural proteins as well as the 3\u02B9 untranslated region, each attenuated virus possessed a different pattern of genomic variation. Overall, only a small number of consensus-level SNPs were acquired during egg passage, leaving a potentially short route back to virulence. These results highlight the unpredictable nature of attenuation by serial egg passage and the need to develop mechanisms to rationally attenuate IBV for the next generation of effective vaccines. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines are currently developed by serial passage of a virulent strain on embryonated hen\u2019s eggs until attenuation; however, little is known about the evolution of the viral population during the process of attenuation. High-throughput sequencing of four replicates of a serially egg-passaged IBV revealed a different pattern of genomic variation in each attenuated replicate and few consensus-level SNPs. This raises concerns that only a small number of genomic mutations are required to revert to a virulent phenotype, which may result in vaccine breakdown in the field. The observed hot spots of variation in the attenuated viruses have the potential to be used in the rational attenuation of virulent IBV for next-generation vaccine design.","publish_time":"2019-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oade, Michael S.; Keep, Sarah; Freimanis, Graham L.; Orton, Richard J.; Britton, Paul; Hammond, John A.; Bickerton, Erica","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65a49f91fda031c7e95543c2d73082b090d08ffc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6600199.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00492-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV vaccines","passaged IBV","IBV population","rational attenuation of virulent IBV","virulent strain","serial egg passage","attenuate IBV","serial passage","attenuated viruses","different vaccines","virulent lab-adapted strain of IBV","Live attenuated vaccines","consensus-level SNPs","different pattern of genomic variation","virulent phenotype","attenuated replicate","process of attenuation","final egg-passaged viruses","unpredictable nature of attenuation","molecular mechanism of attenuation","small number of consensus","generation of effective vaccines","observed hot spots of variation","embryonated chicken eggs","gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","results","virus populations","small number of genomic mutations","consensus-level single nucleotide polymorphisms","embryonated hen\u2019s eggs","IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis","generation vaccine design","parallel independent replicates","viral population","vaccine breakdown","global poultry industry","overall sequence diversity","adult chicken kidney cells","contagious respiratory disease of poultry","major problem","similar growth phenotypes","tracheal organ cultures","spike","3\u02B9 untranslated region","existence","need","nucleocapsid structural proteins","pyrosequencing","times","mechanisms","M41-CK","short route","end of passaging","High-throughput sequencing","potential","virulence","field","evolution","concerns"],"language":"en"},

The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 \u00B0C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P \u003E 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 \u00B0C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P \u003C 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 \u00B0C (3.7 min), 80 \u00B0C (2.4 min), and 90 \u00B0C (2.3 min) compared with 60 \u00B0C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 \u00B0C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.","publish_time":"2017-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trudeau, Michaela P.; Verma, Harsha; Urriola, Pedro E.; Sampedro, Fernando; Shurson, Gerald C.; Goyal, Sagar M.","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b121a4b1dc6d8e513631edeb11421f20aad79106.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5604292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-017-0064-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","PEDV"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["survival of PEDV","PEDV survival","different feed ingredients","different surfaces","virus survival","log reduction of PEDV","different feed matrices","PEDV concentration","different environments","contaminated feed surfaces","virus concentration","inactivation kinetics of PEDV","galvanized steel","stainless steel","different combinations of temperature","time necessary","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","aluminum","study","plastic","differences","RESULTS","maximum inactivation level","economic losses","research","demand","Infection","vomiting","substantial neonatal mortality","dehydration","BACKGROUND","pork industry","potential risk","young pigs","CONCLUSIONS","thermal treatments","temperatures","outbreak investigations","objective","appearance"],"language":"en"},

This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. Methods Consultations to the urology service during a three-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of three pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non- COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value \u003C0.05 was considered significant. Results Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone. No team member developed COVID-19 infection. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urology consultations can be managed in a patient and physician safety-conscious manner, by implementing a novel triage pathway.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borchert, Alex; Baumgarten, Lee; Dalela, Deepansh; Jamil, Marcus; Budzyn, Jeffrey; Kovacevic, Natalija; Yaguchi, Grace; Palma-Zamora, Isaac; Perkins, Sara; Bazzi, Mahdi; Wong, Phil; Sood, Akshay; Peabody, James; Rogers, Craig G; Dabaja, Ali; Atiemo, Humphrey","journal":"Urology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6ad5f6ce5d73595bd6318d0561850c22491ed3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172673.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429520303952?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.059; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429520303952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard","Telemedicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inpatient consultations","inpatient urology consultations","Methods Consultations","associated consultations","Telemedicine consults","High-Risk consults","Standard consults","telephonic consults","non- COVID","urology service","urology patient care strategy","urology team member","person contact","person exposure","person encounters","novel triage pathway","Patient demographics","suspected patients","group of patients","risk-stratified triage pathway","appropriate patient care","pandemic","transmission risk","continuous variables","Chi-square test","consultation parameters","consultation outcomes","healthcare providers","healthcare burden","Categorical variables","three-week period","Mann-Whitney U test","low-acuity urologic issues","physician safety-conscious manner","SARS-CoV","infection","remainder","total","Conclusions","pathways","p-value","Abstract Objectives","month","Results"],"language":"en"},

Follow-up analysis on another cohort of 6 patients 2 weeks post discharge also revealed high titers of IgG antibodies. In all 14 patients tested, 13 displayed serum neutralizing activities in a pseudotype entry assay. Notably, there was a strong correlation between neutralization antibody titers and the numbers of virus-specific T cells. Our work provides a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases.

Molecular clock analyses allowed us to estimate that the BCoV ancestor emerged in the 1940s, and that two geographically distinct lineages diverged from the 1960s-1970s. A recombination event in the spike gene (breakpoint at nt 1100) may be at the origin of the genetic divergence sixty years ago. Little evidence of genetic mixing between the spatially segregated lineages was found, suggesting that BCoV genetic diversity is a result of a global transmission pathway that occurred during the last century.

However, the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome revealed limitations in the existing systems of management of field epidemiologists and communicable diseases. METHODS: The present study aims to evaluate data on current states, administrative reports, and other literature on the field epidemiologist system that has been in place in South Korea for 16 years since 1999 and to suggest appropriate future improvements in this system. RESULTS: By suggesting methods to evaluate the field epidemiologist system and training programs and by suggesting ways for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct evaluations on its own, the present study provides supporting evidence for improvement of systems for training of experts in epidemiological investigations. Moreover, based on the findings, this study also suggests methods to systematically train experts in communicable diseases management and a sustainable system to establish the basis of and develop strategies for a systematic and phased management of field epidemiologist training programs. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests the possibility of establishing dedicated training facilities, revising the guidelines on training and improvement of the competency of public health experts, while not limiting the scope of application to communicable diseases.","publish_time":"2017-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Moo-Sik; Kim, Eun-Young; Lee, Sang-Won","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df2491bf73b3224ca6018e8f7cb2242e633e636c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c0bba2814eb6c6e6af25662fc57b78b04d471191.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5847970.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2017058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29370686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["training of experts","field epidemiologist system of South Korea","present study","phased management of field epidemiologist training programs","communicable diseases management","field epidemiologists","sustainable system","METHODS","infectious diseases","dedicated training facilities","competency of public health experts","existing systems of management","improvement of systems","Korea Centers","epidemiological investigations","ready supply of experts","public health doctors","limitations","data","Disease Control","outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","effective response","supporting evidence","administrative reports","Prevention","ways","guidelines","possibility","literature","place","current states","evaluations","strategies","years","scope of application","appropriate future improvements","basis","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","findings","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study was a retrospective record review of patients who underwent allo-HSCT at Royal Melbourne Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Symptomatic patients were tested using respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to identify risk factors for vRTI and the risk of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. A total of 382 patients were reviewed, and 65 episodes of vRTI were identified in 56 patients (14.7%). Rhinovirus accounted for the majority of infections (69.2%). The majority of episodes presented initially with upper respiratory tract infection (58.5%), with 28.9% of them progressing to lower respiratory tract infection.

Here, we developed a novel bivalent vaccine against MERS-CoV and rabies virus (RV) using the replication-incompetent P-gene-deficient RV (RV\u0394P), which has been previously established as a promising and safe viral vector. MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein comprises S1 and S2 subunits, with the S1 subunit being a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant RV\u0394P, which expresses S1 fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids from the ectodomains of the RV-glycoprotein (RV-G), was developed using a reverse genetics method and named RV\u0394P-MERS/S1. Following generation of RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 and RV\u0394P, our analysis revealed that they shared similar growth properties, with the expression of S1 in RV\u0394P-MERS/S1-infected cells confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot, and the immunogenicity and pathogenicity evaluated using mouse infection experiments. We observed no rabies-associated signs or symptoms in mice inoculated with RV\u0394P-MERS/S1. Moreover, virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against both MERS-CoV and RV were induced in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with RV\u0394P-MERS/S1.

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.

Briefly, we performed virtual screening of a database of small molecules against SARS 3CLpro, analyzed inhibitor\u2013protease complexes, and identified several covalent and non-covalent inhibitors. Several old drugs that bind to SARS 3CLpro active site were selected and in silico derivatized to generate covalent irreversible inhibitors with enhanced affinity. Furthermore, we show that pharmacophores derived from clusters of compounds resulting out of virtual screening could be useful probes for future structure\u2013activity relationship studies (SARs) and fine-tune the lead molecules identified.","publish_time":"2004-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajnarayanan, Rajendram V.; Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan; Pattabiraman, Nagarajan","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d6f48f843818efe735f07b63f1730d859ccc4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092804.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04014433; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04014433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["main protease","anti-SARS drug design","protease complexes","covalent irreversible inhibitors","virtual screening","non-covalent inhibitors","old drugs","CLpro active site","future structure","main targets","lead molecules","clinical approval","database of small molecules","extensive clinical testing","useful probes","activity relationship studies","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","propagation","new uses","silico","enhanced affinity","attractive approach","clusters of compounds","coronaviral life cycle","pharmacophores"],"language":"en"},

Affected calves exhibit tympany, hemorrhagic abomasitis, and abomasal ulceration. Gram-positive bacilli are often found on affected mucosa and in submucosa. Aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood, but probably include dietary issues, perhaps relating to overfeeding, feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum, or conditions which effect decreased gut motility. Fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome. The calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea, and the abdomen became distended and painful. In spite of intensive therapy, the calf died \u223C48h after birth. At necropsy, the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid, and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic. The proximal duodenum was hemorrhagic and emphysematous, and microscopic examination revealed Gram-positive rods in association with acute, necrotizing, hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation. Isolates of C. perfringens from this calf were PCR positive for cpb2, the gene encoding beta2 toxin. This finding is of unknown significance; only 14.3% (8/56) of isolates from other calves with the syndrome have been cpb2 positive, and only 50% of cpb2 positive bovine isolates express CPB2. The most prominent needs to further our understanding of this problem are consistent experimental reproduction of the disease, elucidation of virulence attributes, and development and application of prevention and control strategies.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glenn Songer, J.; Miskimins, Dale W.","journal":"Anaerobe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111123.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996405000430; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1075996405000430","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hemorrhagic abomasitis","Fatal hemorrhagic enteritis","Isolates of","hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation","cpb2 positive bovine isolates express CPB2","common causes of clostridial hemorrhagic enteritis","cloned gaur calf","PCR positive","syndrome","calves","bloody fluid","bloody diarrhea","Gram-positive rods","distended abomasum","Gram-positive bacilli","abomasal ulceration","affected mucosa","Clostridium perfringens type","association","development","disease","necrotizing","microscopic examination","clotted milk","consistent experimental reproduction","elucidation of virulence attributes","conditions","understanding","infecting organism","application of prevention","gene","neonatal ruminants","problem","Abstract Infections","abdomen","tympany","dietary issues","Aspects of etiology","control strategies","omasal walls","decreased gut motility","necropsy","spite of intensive therapy","beta2 toxin","proximal duodenum","contaminated colostrum","finding","unknown significance","prominent needs","overfeeding","submucosa","birth"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the prevalence, risk factors, and characteristics of immunocompromised patients coming from the community with pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of an international, multicenter study enrolling adult patients coming from the community with pneumonia and hospitalized in 222 hospitals in 54 countries worldwide. Risk factors for immunocompromise included AIDS, aplastic anemia, asplenia, hematological cancer, chemotherapy, neutropenia, biological drug use, lung transplantation, chronic steroid use, and solid tumor. RESULTS: At least 1 risk factor for immunocompromise was recorded in 18% of the 3702 patients enrolled. The prevalences of risk factors significantly differed across continents and countries, with chronic steroid use (45%), hematological cancer (25%), and chemotherapy (22%) the most common. Among immunocompromised patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens were the most frequently identified, and prevalences did not differ from those in immunocompetent patients. Risk factors for immunocompromise were independently associated with neither Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor non\u2013community-acquired bacteria. Specific risk factors were independently associated with fungal infections (odds ratio for AIDS and hematological cancer, 15.10 and 4.65, respectively; both P = .001), mycobacterial infections (AIDS; P = .006), and viral infections other than influenza (hematological cancer, 5.49; P \u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could be considered by clinicians in prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP in immunocompromised patients. Patients with AIDS and hematological cancer admitted with CAP may have higher prevalences of fungi, mycobacteria, and noninfluenza viruses.","publish_time":"2018-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Pasquale, Marta Francesca; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Gramegna, Andrea; Radovanovic, Dejan; Terraneo, Silvia; Reyes, Luis F; Rupp, Jan; Gonz\u00E1lez del Castillo, Juan; Blasi, Francesco; Aliberti, Stefano; Restrepo, Marcos I","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ad8104b50986065ba9b7cbac8fec261b8a97062.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cb4f5f35816826a7e3970f11e6948d58e2101adc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6481991.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222287/; http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/136778/1/12474_5651482_dipasquale2018.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hematological cancer","prevalences of risk factors","adult patients","immunocompetent patients","characteristics of immunocompromised patients","AIDS","pneumonia","Specific risk factors","community","correct management of immunocompromised patients","CAP","chronic steroid use","fungal infections","viral infections","mycobacterial infections","chemotherapy","countries","biological drug use","higher prevalences of fungi","lung transplantation","neutropenia","aplastic anemia","prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy","asplenia","odds ratio","multicenter study","clinicians","continents","secondary analysis","solid tumor","noninfluenza viruses","BACKGROUND","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","findings","METHODS","RESULTS","hospitals","pathogens","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Treatment measures such as curative therapy and case isolation exert selective pressure by reducing the duration of infectivity, reducing the value of duration-increasing strategies to the pathogen and favoring pathogen strategies that maximize the rate of transmission. We extend the trade-off models of previous authors, and represents the reproduction number of the pathogen as a function of the transmissibility, host contact rate, disease-induced mortality, recovery rate, and treatment rate, each of which may be influenced by the virulence. We find that when virulence is subject to a transmissibility-mortality trade-off, treatment can lead to an increase in optimal virulence, but that in other scenarios (such as the activity-recovery trade-off) treatment decreases the optimal virulence. Paradoxically, when levels of treatment rise with pathogen virulence, increasing control efforts may raise predicted levels of optimal virulence. Thus we show that conflict can arise between the epidemiological benefits of treatment and the evolutionary risks of heightened virulence.","publish_time":"2005-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porco, Travis C.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Gross, Kimber L.; Galvani, Alison P.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8633e427b6d705db65d4b73fc201a87e03f4e253.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126720.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304004655; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519304004655","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen virulence","treatment rate","levels of treatment","predicted levels of optimal virulence","recovery rate","Treatment measures","pathogen strategies","rate of transmission","evolutionary risks of heightened virulence","transmissibility-mortality trade-off","epidemiological benefits of treatment","duration of infectivity","host contact rate","activity-recovery trade-off","value of duration","trade-off models of previous authors","disease-induced mortality","curative therapy","selective pressure","case isolation","control efforts","function","reproduction number","increase","conflict","scenarios"],"language":"en"},

Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019\u2019s effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of \u223C5 days (range, 2\u201314 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49\u201356 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54\u201373%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be \u223C1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks\u2019 gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rasmussen, Sonja A.; Smulian, John C.; Lednicky, John A.; Wen, Tony S.; Jamieson, Denise J.","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d682f1a564a088d3d01a66f88b5c88c26b1816fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105680/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820301976; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820301976; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration","Centers for Disease Control"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe respiratory illness","Disease Control","emerging disease","progressive respiratory failure","pregnancies","coronavirus-specific treatments","early data","Fetal distress","pregnancy complications","fetal monitoring","case reports","hospitalized cases","case-fatality rate","fetal demise","preterm delivery","nonpregnant women","Limited data","bacterial infection risk","early mechanical ventilation","Overall case fatality rate","Average age of hospitalized patients","early isolation","close contact","Initial reports","Coronaviruses cause illness","evidence","utero transmission","underlying illness","latest information","secondary bacterial pneumonia","days of symptom onset","aggressive infection control procedures","renal failure","laboratory testing","primary epidemiologic risk factors","Abnormal testing","mainland China","infected individuals","pathogenic coronaviruses","Principles of management","Frequent manifestations","contact investigation","rapid increase","trimester infections","nonpregnant adults","uterine contraction monitoring","individualized delivery planning","oxygen therapy","avoidance of fluid overload","consideration of empiric antibiotics","coinfection","chest radiographic imaging","lymphopenia","abnormalities","Hubei Province","severity","travel","largest series","insights","team-based approach","health care facility","myalgia","leukopenia","weeks\u2019 gestation","fever","cough","deaths","Centers","Prevention website","intravascular coagulopathy","s effects","headache","multispecialty consultations","date","identification","times","illnesses","US Food","clinical findings","cesarean deliveries","incubation period","Drug Administration","Wuhan","half","sepsis","range","spontaneous abortion","diarrhea","thrombocytopenia","years","Clinicians","Children"],"language":"en"},

Despite this promise, there is currently only a single class of human-designed small molecules that target RNA used clinically \u2013 the linezolid antibiotics. A growing number of small-molecule RNA ligands are being identified, however, leading to burgeoning interest in the field. Here, we discuss principles for discovering small-molecule drugs that target RNA and argue that the overarching challenge is to identify appropriate target structures \u2013 namely in disease-causing RNAs that have high information content, and consequently appropriate ligand binding pockets. If focus is placed on such druggable binding sites in RNA, extensive knowledge of the kinds of molecules that comprise conventional drugs could then enable small-molecule drug discovery for RNA targets to become (only) roughly as difficult as for protein targets.","publish_time":"2018-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warner, Katherine Deigan; Hajdin, Christine E.; Weeks, Kevin M.","journal":"Nature Reviews Drug Discovery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b833b7e5501944dfe1db8a6657e05360661353d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6420209.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd.2018.93; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29977051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Messenger"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA molecules","small molecules","RNA targets","molecule RNA ligands","small-molecule drugs","disease-causing RNAs","kinds of molecules","small-molecule drug discovery","protein targets","growing number of small","appropriate target structures","non-coding RNAs","cellular information transfer","appropriate ligand binding pockets","conventional drugs","human diseases","high information content","druggable binding sites","numerous cellular processes","single class of human","extensive knowledge","opportunities","gene regulation","structured elements","overarching challenge","evidence","Messenger","principles","function","focus","linezolid antibiotics","field","promise"],"language":"en"},

Swift identification and implementation of transmission based precautions (TBP) for patients known or suspected of having an epidemiologically important pathogen is important. ED staff, particularly triage nurses, are pivotal in detecting and preventing infection, including healthcare associated infections (HAI). Methods MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and Ovid were searched for articles published between 2004 and 2015 using key search terms: infection control/prevention and emergency department(s), triage, and transmission based precautions and emergency department(s), and triage, to identify common themes for discussion. Systematic review/meta-analysis was not in the scope of this exploration. Findings Themes were identified relating to HAI and ED practices and grouped into: assisted detection of conditions for which TBP is required, ED and TBP, mass-causality event/bioterrorism/pandemic/epidemic, infection control not TBP and multi-resistant organisms not TBP. The literature is heavily influenced by worldwide epidemic/pandemics and bioterrorist risks resulting in increased awareness of the importance of swift identification of syndromes that require TBP, but only in these situations. Conclusion Implementation of appropriate TBP, changing triage practices, training and measures to assist decision-making could assist in preventing HAI in the ED context.

In contrast, there is limited data that viral infections evoke acute episodes of asthma that require emergency care in adults. To determine the role of viral infections in exacerbations of asthma in adults, we examined 33 patients who presented to the emergency room with 35 exacerbations of asthma between September 1990 and March 1991 for the presence of a viral infection. A nasal swab was obtained for virus isolation by culture and rapid antigen detection by fluorescent staining. In 16 patients, serum was collected at initial presentation and 3 to 4 weeks later for acute and convalescent viral antibody titers. All patients had acute episodes of asthma ascertained by medical history and physical examination. About 56% of the patients with asthma exacerbations had symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Rapid antigen detection and viral cultures for influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, 2, 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus were negative on all patients. Likewise, in all 16 patients tested, acute and convalescent serologic studies did not show a significant rise in titer by complement fixation test. Thus, despite symptoms consistent with viral infection, viral pathogens could not be shown by current virologic techniques. This study suggests that viral infection may not be as prevalent a precipitate of asthma in adults requiring emergency room treatment as is generally thought.","publish_time":"2016-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sokhandan, Mehrgan; McFadden, E.

The objective of this prospective interventional study was to evaluate the etiology, diagnostic procedures, risk factors and outcome of pulmonary complications in a cohort of hematopoietic SCT recipients followed up for 1 year. For patients suffering from a pulmonary complication, a diagnostic algorithm that included non-invasive and bronchoscopic procedures was performed. We identified 73 pulmonary complications in 169 patients: 50 (68%) were pneumonias; 21 (29%) were non-infectious complications and 2 (3%) were undiagnosed. Viruses (particularly Rhinovirus) and bacteria (particularly P. aeruginosa) (28 and 26%, respectively) were the most common causes of pneumonia. A specific diagnosis was obtained in 83% of the cases. A non-invasive test gave a specific diagnosis in 59% of the episodes. The diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy was 67 and 78% in pulmonary infections. Early bronchoscopy (\u2A7D5 days) had higher diagnostic yield than late bronchoscopy (78 vs 23%; P=0.02) for pulmonary infections. Overall mortality was 22 and 32% of all fatalities were due to pulmonary complications. Pulmonary complications are common and constitute an independent risk factor for mortality, stressing the importance of an appropriate clinical management.

METHODS: This is a non-randomized short-term cross-over trial in which 12 pediatric patients with asynchrony (auto-triggering, double triggering or non-triggered breaths) were enrolled. Four sequential 10-min periods of data were recorded after 20 min of ventilatory stabilization (wash-out) at each of the following settings: baseline PS with the ventilator settings determined by the attending physician (1-PS(b)); PS after optimization (2-PS(opt)); NAVA level set so that maximum inspiratory pressure (P (max)) equaled P (max) in PS (3-NAVA); same settings as in 2-PS(opt) (4-PS(opt)). RESULTS: The median asynchrony index was significantly lower during NAVA (2.0 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (8.5 %, p = 0.017) and 4-PS(opt) (7.5 %, p = 0.008). In NAVA mode, the NAVA trigger accounted on average for 66 % of triggered breaths. The median trigger delay with respect to neural inspiratory time was significantly lower during NAVA (8.6 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (25.2 %, p = 0.003) and 4-PS(opt) (28.2 %, p = 0.0005). The median electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) change during trigger delay normalized to maximum inspiratory EAdi difference was significantly lower during NAVA (5.3 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (21.7 %, p = 0.0005) and 4-PS(opt) (24.6 %, p = 0.001). The coefficient of variation of tidal volume was significantly higher during NAVA (44.2 %) than during 2-PS(opt) (19.8 %, p = 0.0002) and 4-PS(opt) (23.0 %, p = 0.0005). The median COMFORT score during NAVA (15.0) was lower than that during 2-PS(opt) (18.0, p = 0.0125) and 4-PS(opt) (17.5, p = 0.039). No significant changes for any variable were observed between 1-PS(b) and 2-PS(opt).

Tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes respiratory failure in patients with extensive pulmonary parenchymal involvement, but it is a rare cause of ARDS. We report our experience of TB presenting with ARDS. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 187 patients admitted with a diagnosis of ARDS over the previous 7 years. Data are presented in a descriptive fashion using mean\u00B1SD or median (range). RESULTS: Nine (4.9%) of 187 patients had ARDS secondary to tuberculosis. All patients were mechanically ventilated. The diagnosis was made on clinico-radiological grounds and confirmed later using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy in seven patients, and lymph node biopsy and examination of the joint aspirate in the remaining two. All patients were empirically started on anti-tubercular therapy with a median time to initiation of therapy being 3 days (range 2\u20138 days). Three patients had multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) without any evidence of bacterial infection. Seven of nine (77.8%) patients survived; two died because of severe ARDS, MODS, and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is an uncommon but definite cause of ARDS, and in patients with ARDS of obscure aetiology where the clinical features suggest tuberculosis as the inciting cause, antitubercular therapy should be started empirically and the diagnosis actively pursued later.","publish_time":"2005-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agarwal, Ritesh; Gupta, Dheeraj; Aggarwal, Ashutosh N.; Behera, Digamber; Jindal, Surinder K.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/805777e8d84af2e478fca3a4bcbf36a283095f49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzUwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","diagnosis of ARDS","severe ARDS","ARDS secondary","definite cause of ARDS","rare cause of ARDS","Tuberculosis","ARDS of obscure aetiology","respiratory failure","inciting cause","MODS","important cause of morbidity","initiation of therapy","antitubercular therapy","range","days","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","anti-tubercular therapy","median time","transbronchial biopsy","experience of TB","lymph node biopsy","multi-organ dysfunction syndrome","mortality","clinical features","extensive pulmonary parenchymal involvement","examination","mean","SD","fiberoptic bronchoscopy","descriptive fashion","joint aspirate","intensive care units","OBJECTIVE","clinico-radiological grounds","evidence of bacterial infection","METHODS","Retrospective analysis","Data","CONCLUSIONS","years","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although generally well tolerated compared to chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy may be associated with adverse events requiring ICU admission. Informing clinicians about clinical features of these toxic events might maintain awareness and favor early recognition, prompt diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published case reports of molecular targeted therapy-related life-threatening toxicity that led to ICU admission. The search used the Pubmed database using medical subject heading (Mesh) terms, including all FDA-approved molecular targeted therapy (TT), up to March 2019. No language restriction was applied. All cases reports of patients admitted to the ICU for molecular targeted therapy-related toxicity were included. Non-FDA-approved combinations of treatments or hormonal therapy were not included. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-three cases were identified. Nearly half of them (n = 102; 40.3%) were related to anti-angiogenic agents, mostly for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications. Other molecules responsible for adverse events were chiefly immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 85, 33.6%), EGFR inhibitors (n = 33; 13.0%), and anti-HER2 (n = 10; 4.0%). They were associated with adverse events such as respiratory or hypersensitivity events. Management and outcomes associated with these life-threatening complications are reported. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the vast number of treated patients, only 253 cases of molecular therapy-related severe toxicity are reported in cancer patients. Symptoms and biomarkers that depict these events need to be better identified as to allow appropriate reporting and improving dose and schedule of the treatment adapted to each patient.

OBJECTIVES: To describe treatments and outcomes according to comorbidities in patients with ARDS admitted to 19 ICUs (1997\u20132014). METHODS: Patients were grouped based on comorbidities. Determinants of day-28 mortality were identified by multivariable Cox analysis stratified on center. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 4953 ARDS patients, 2545 (51.4%) had major comorbidities; the proportion with major comorbidities increased after 2008. Hematological malignancy was associated with severe ARDS and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia. COPD, HIV infection, and hematological malignancy were associated with a lower likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation on the admission day. Admission-day SOFA score was higher in patients with major comorbidities, who more often received vasopressors, dialysis, or treatment-limitation decisions. Day-28 mortality was 33.7% overall, 27.2% in patients without major comorbidities, and 31.1% (COPD) to 56% (hematological malignancy) in patients with major comorbidities. By multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in patients with COPD and higher in those with chronic heart failure, solid tumors, or hematological malignancies. Mortality was independently associated with P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) and PaCO(2) on day 1, ARDS of pulmonary origin, worse SOFA score, and ICU-acquired events. CONCLUSIONS: Half the patients with ARDS had major comorbidities, which were associated with severe ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction, and day-28 mortality. These findings do not support the exclusion of ARDS patients with severe comorbidities from randomized clinical trials. Trials in ARDS patients with whatever comorbidities are warranted.

The influence of the PEEP level was investigated on bacteriology and histology in a model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. SUBJECTS: Nineteen New Zealand rabbits. INTERVENTIONS: The animals were mechanically ventilated with a positive inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH(2)O and received either a zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP, n=6), a 5 cmH(2)O PEEP (n=5) or a 10 cmH(2)O PEEP (n=4). An inoculum of Enterobacter aerogenes was then instilled intrabronchially. The non-ventilated pneumonia group (n=4) was composed of spontaneously breathing animals which received the same inoculum. Pneumonia was assessed 24 h later. MAIN RESULTS: The lung bacterial burden was higher in mechanically ventilated animals compared with spontaneously breathing animals. All animals from the latter group had negative spleen cultures. The spleen bacterial concentration was found to be lower in the 5 cmH(2)O PEEP group when compared to the ZEEP and 10 cmH(2)O PEEP groups (3.1\u00B11.5 vs 4.9\u00B11.1 and 5.0\u00B11.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively; p\u003C0.05). Lung weight and histological score values were lower in the spontaneously breathing animals as well as in the 5 cmH(2)O PEEP group compared with the ZEEP and 10 cmH(2)O groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation substantially increased the lung bacterial burden and worsened the histological aspects of pneumonia in this rabbit model. Variations in terms of lung injury and systemic spreading of infection were noted with respect to the ventilatory strategy.","publish_time":"2004-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charles, Pierre Emmanuel; Martin, Laurent; Etienne, Manuel; Croisier, Delphine; Piroth, Lionel; Lequeu, Catherine; Pugin, Jerome; Portier, Henri; Chavanet, Pascal","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5355e62fecbd6e0163f67396f9273dd2398accf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nineteen New Zealand"],"locations":["ZEEP"],"keyphrases":["cmH","O PEEP groups","O groups","ventilated animals","PEEP level","lung bacterial burden","Lung weight","lung protective","ZEEP","non-ventilated pneumonia group","associated pneumonia","terms of lung injury","histological aspects of pneumonia","positive end-expiratory pressure","positive inspiratory pressure","spleen bacterial concentration","Ventilatory strategies","model of ventilator","rabbit model","ventilatory strategy","histological score values","negative spleen cultures","inoculum of Enterobacter aerogenes","low tidal volume","systemic spreading of infection","Mechanical ventilation","respect","histology","OBJECTIVE","bacteriology","MAIN RESULTS","cfu","SUBJECTS","New Zealand rabbits","Variations","CONCLUSIONS","influence","vs","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: The adult medical ICU of a tertiary care, university-based medical center. Participants: The study population consisted of 48 patients admitted to the ICU, 24 of whom received mechanical ventilation. Measurements: All patients were evaluated for the development and persistence of delirium on a daily basis by a geriatric or psychiatric specialist with expertise in delirium assessment using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria of the American Psychiatric Association, the reference standard for delirium ratings. Primary outcomes measured were length of stay in the ICU and hospital. Results: The mean onset of delirium was 2.6 days (S.D.\u00B11.7), and the mean duration was 3.4\u00B11.9 days. Of the 48 patients, 39 (81.3%) developed delirium, and of these 29 (60.4%) developed the complication while still in the ICU. The duration of delirium was associated with length of stay in the ICU (r=0.65, P=0.0001) and in the hospital (r=0.68, P\u003C0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, delirium was the strongest predictor of length of stay in the hospital (P=0.006) even after adjusting for severity of illness, age, gender, race, and days of benzodiazepine and narcotic drug administration. Conclusions: In this patient cohort, the majority of patients developed delirium in the ICU, and delirium was the strongest independent determinant of length of stay in the hospital. Further study and monitoring of delirium in the ICU and the risk factors for its development are warranted.","publish_time":"2001-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ely, E.; Gautam, S.; Margolin, R.; Francis, J.; May, L.; Speroff, T.; Truman, B.; Dittus, R.; Bernard, G.; Inouye, S.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0c2cd30dd839d3f2b0502bdda99cb1ac58c0052.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of delirium","delirium assessment","persistence of delirium","delirium ratings","monitoring of delirium","hospital","mean onset of delirium","adult medical ICU","strongest predictor of length","majority of patients","study population","Study objective","prospective cohort study","strongest independent determinant of length","days of benzodiazepine","development","mean duration","DSM-IV","psychiatric specialist","tertiary care","medical center","patient cohort","Primary outcomes","American Psychiatric Association","intensive care unit","Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV","criteria","reference standard","expertise","daily basis","geriatric","gender","race","university","relationship","age","narcotic drug administration","severity of illness","multivariate analysis","risk factors","Design","Setting","Results","Conclusions","Participants","mechanical ventilation","Measurements","complication"],"language":"en"},

Mitigating therapies, aside from impractical organ transplantation, remain limited and the possibility of regenerative medicine has lacked empirical support. However, it is clinically known that patients who survive sudden, massive loss of lung tissue from necrotizing pneumonia(3,4) or acute respiratory distress syndrome(5,6) often recover full pulmonary function within six months. Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following H1N1 influenza virus infection, and linked distal airway stem cells expressing Trp63 (p63) and keratin 5, called DASC(p63/Krt5), to this process(7). Here we show that pre-existing, intrinsically committed DASC(p63/Krt5) undergo a proliferative expansion in response to influenza-induced lung damage, and assemble into nascent alveoli at sites of interstitial lung inflammation. We also show that the selective ablation of DASC(p63/Krt5) in vivo prevents this regeneration, leading to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange. Finally, we demonstrate that single DASC(p63/Krt5)-derived pedigrees differentiate to type I and type II pneumocytes as well as bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation to infected lung and also minimize the structural consequences of endogenous stem cell loss on this process. The ability to propagate these cells in culture while maintaining their intrinsic lineage commitment suggests their potential in stem cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases.

OUTCOME: Survivors of new BPD may have problems in adult life concerning lung and cardiovascular function, growth and neurosensory and/or motor development.","publish_time":"2013-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herting, E.","journal":"Monatsschr Kinderheilkd","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39ada86b821b8e20246caa6a68aaaea2854a162e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["old BPD","Survivors of new BPD","new type","premature infants","lung capillary development","Surfactant therapy","stem cell therapy","fibroproliferative chronic lung disease","growth factors","motor development","consequence of mechanical ventilation","oxygen exposure","respiratory distress syndrome","adult life","cardiovascular function","problems","simplification of alveolarisation","increased survival","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","immaturity-related multisystem disorder","stop","years","date","OUTCOME","symptomatic treatment","success","animal experiments"],"language":"en"},

Necrotizing fasciits of the extremities is found after simple skin lacerations and often in rural, farming or garden setting environments. Many of the infections are found in immunologically healthy people, but persons revealing a compromised wound healing are endangered additionally, e.g., diabetes. In the majority of the microbiological analyses, streptococci alone or a mixture with mainly anaerobic bacteria may be detected. The management of infected extremities requires a rapid diagnosis, dedicated aggressive surgical management as soon as possible, and a wide debridement extending the border of the infected fascia. Timely surgical revisions within the first day or days together with antibiotic treatment are the only measures to stop the infection. Depending on the status of the patient a hyperbaric oxygenation treatment seems to be useful in order to limit the infection. In fulminated cases early amputations, maximal intensive care treatment of the septic patient are required, where all means are warranted to save the patients life.

Despite reports of its possible role in insulin exocytosis and cell proliferation, its function in beta cells remains controversial. We aimed to characterise the function of TMEM27 in islets and its potential use as a beta cell mass biomarker. METHODS: To determine TMEM27 function, we studied TMEM27 gene expression and localisation in human healthy and diabetic islets, the correlation of its expression with cell cycle and insulin secretion genes in human islets, its expression in tungstate-treated rats, and the effects of its overproduction on insulin secretion and proliferation in a beta cell line and islets. To elucidate its utility as a beta cell mass biomarker, we studied TMEM27 cleavage in a beta cell line, islets and primary proximal tubular cells. RESULTS: TMEM27 mRNA levels in islets are lower in diabetic donors than in controls. Its gene expression correlates with that of insulin and SNAPIN in human islets. TMEM27 expression is downregulated in islets of tungstate-treated rats, which exhibit decreased insulin secretion and increased proliferation. TMEM27 overproduction in a beta cell line and islets significantly enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion, with modest or no effects on proliferation. Finally, TMEM27 is cleaved and shed by renal proximal tubular cells and pancreatic islets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data support a role for TMEM27 in glucose-induced insulin secretion but not in cell proliferation. The finding that its cleavage is not specific to beta cells challenges the current support for its use as a potential beta cell mass biomarker.

In most cases, these mediators of inflammation provide protection against bacterial, viral and protozoal infections. However, unchecked inflammasome activities perpetuate chronic inflammation, which underpins the molecular and pathophysiological basis of gastritis, IBD, upper and lower gastrointestinal cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity. Studies have also highlighted an inflammasome signature in the maintenance of gut microbiota and gut\u2013brain homeostasis. Harnessing the immunomodulatory properties of the inflammasome could transform clinical practice in the treatment of acute and chronic gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal diseases. This Review presents an overview of inflammasome biology in gastrointestinal health and disease and describes the value of experimental and pharmacological intervention in the treatment of inflammasome-associated clinical manifestations.","publish_time":"2018-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Man, Si Ming","journal":"Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60583a4945608dbe8ba46ec97c08366d9714f3f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzgzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of inflammasome","inflammasome signature","Inflammasome signalling","inflammasome complex","overview of inflammasome biology","unchecked inflammasome activities","regulation of gastrointestinal health","lower gastrointestinal cancer","chronic inflammation","nonalcoholic fatty liver disease","treatment of acute","pro-inflammatory cytokines IL","mediators of inflammation","clinical practice","clinical manifestations","maintenance of gut microbiota","form of inflammatory cell death","IBD","release","central role","emerging pillar of innate immunity","pathophysiological basis of gastritis","protection","value of experimental","pharmacological intervention","obesity","execution","brain homeostasis","extragastrointestinal diseases","protozoal infections","pyroptosis","Review","immunomodulatory properties","cases","Activation","Studies"],"language":"en"},

To control emerging infections, however, vaccines will need to be delivered to older individuals who, unlike infants, probably have had prior infection or vaccination with related viruses and thus have cross-reactive antibodies against the vaccines. Whether and how these cross-reactive antibodies impact live attenuated vaccination efficacy is unclear. Using an open-label randomized trial design, we show that subjects with a specific range of cross-reactive antibody titres from a prior inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccination enhanced yellow fever (YF) immunogenicity upon YF vaccination. Enhancing titres of cross-reactive antibodies prolonged YF vaccine viraemia, provoked greater pro-inflammatory responses, and induced adhesion molecules intrinsic to the activating Fc-receptor signalling pathway, namely immune semaphorins, facilitating immune cell interactions and trafficking. Our findings clinically demonstrate antibody-enhanced infection and suggest that vaccine efficacy could be improved by exploiting cross-reactive antibodies.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The case study research is based on an analysis of official documentation and interviews with policy elites at multiple levels of UK governance. FINDINGS: Results of this study show that policy actors regard risk communication, the dynamics of international public policy and UK territorial governance as the main governance challenges in the management of influenza at a macro-level. The paper also serves to identify that although contingencies management for epidemiological issues require technical and scientific considerations to feature in governance arrangements, equally there are key \u201Cwicked problems\u201D in the context public policy that pervade the health security sector. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study indicates the need to build in resources at a national level to plan for policy coordination challenges in areas that might at first be seen as devoid of political machinations (such as technical areas of public policy that might be underpinned by epidemiological processes). The identification of the major governance challenges that emerge from the pandemic influenza case study is a springboard for a research agenda in relation to the analysis of the parallels and paradoxes of governance challenges for health security across EU member states.

Prompt diagnosis of GAS can improve the quality of patient care and minimize the unnecessary use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop an alternative nucleic acid amplification method for the diagnosis of GAS. METHOD: We developed and evaluated a strand invasion based amplification (SIBA) assay to rapidly and specifically detect GAS. The performance of the developed GAS SIBA assay was compared with an established GAS polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: The GAS SIBA assay detected small amounts (ten copies) of S. pyogenes DNA within 13 min. The rapid detection time was achieved in part by optimization of magnesium concentration and reaction temperature. The sensitivity and specificity of the GAS SIBA assay for detection of S. pyogenes from clinical specimens were both 100%, and clinical specimens were detected within ~ 8 min of starting the reaction. CONCLUSION: Because the GAS SIBA assay is performed at low and constant temperature, it can be used both in centralized laboratories and for point-of-care testing. Furthermore, given its short detection time and strong analytical performance, the GAS SIBA assay could help to improve patient care and minimize unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.","publish_time":"2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elf, Sonja; Olli, Jenni; Hirvonen, Sanna; Auvinen, Pauliina; Eboigbodin, Kevin E.","journal":"Mol Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8affb5947f8f36f87d44577882eeb89f120084df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099210.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed GAS SIBA assay","Prompt diagnosis of GAS","established GAS polymerase chain reaction","Streptococcus pyogenes","reaction temperature","short detection time","rapid detection time","pyogenes DNA","quality of patient care","care testing","OBJECTIVE","clinical specimens","unnecessary use of antibiotics","unnecessary prescription of antibiotics","constant temperature","alternative nucleic acid amplification method","strong analytical performance","PCR","adults","variety","copies","sore throat hospital visits","group","small amounts","optimization of magnesium concentration","children","point","specificity","communicable infections","strand invasion","accounting","INTRODUCTION","sensitivity","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","centralized laboratories"],"language":"en"},

Amongst hospitalised COVID-19 patients, there is a high prevalence of established cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is evidence showing that COVID-19 may exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors and preexisting CVD or may lead to cardiovascular complications. With intensive care units operating at maximum capacity and such staggering mortality rates reported, it is imperative during this time-sensitive COVID-19 outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and/or myocardial injury. Preliminary findings from COVID-19 studies have shown the association of biomarkers of acute cardiac injury and coagulation with worse prognosis. While these biomarkers are recognised for CVD, there is emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in COVID-19, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes. Consequently, the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and to highlight considerations for incorporating laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in COVID-19 to optimise outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aboughdir, Maryam; Kirwin, Thomas; Abdul Khader, Ashiq; Wang, Brian","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["hospitalised COVID","cardiovascular risk factors","time-sensitive COVID","cardiovascular performance","cardiovascular comorbidities","cardiovascular complications","cardiovascular prognostic factors","patients","worse outcomes","high prevalence of established cardiovascular disease","association of biomarkers","preexisting CVD","increased risk of adverse outcomes","coronavirus disease","worse prognosis","acute cardiac injury","laboratory testing of biomarkers","myocardial injury","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","staggering mortality rates","maximum capacity","coagulation","studies","outbreak","morbidity","intensive care units","SARS-CoV","review","considerations","raised infectivity","severity","emerging prospect","Preliminary findings","cases","deaths","Wuhan","China","aim","total","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Because in ovo vaccination is presently used in commercial applications worldwide throughout the poultry industry, the current study was undertaken to investigate chicken embryo vaccination with profilin plus QCDC adjuvant. Eighteen day-old embryos were immunized with isotonic saline (control), profilin alone, QCDC alone, or profilin plus QCDC, and orally challenged with live Eimeria maxima at 7 days post-hatch. Body weight gain, fecal oocyst output, and intestinal cytokine transcript levels were assessed as measures of protective immunity. While immunization with profilin alone or QCDC alone did not alter body weight gain of infected chickens compared with the saline control group, vaccination with profilin plus QCDC increased body weight gain such that it was equal to the uninfected controls. Immunization with profilin plus QCDC also reduced fecal oocyst shedding compared with unimmunized controls, although in this case QCDC failed to provide an adjuvant effect since no difference was observed between the profilin-only and profilin/QCDC groups. Finally, increased levels of transcripts encoding IL-1\u03B2, IL-15, and IFN-\u03B3 were seen in the intestinal tissues of animals given profilin plus QCDC compared with the profilin-only or QCDC-only groups.

To identify efficacious small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the replication of FMDV, candidate siRNAs corresponding to FMDV VP1 gene were designed and synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. In reporter assays, five siRNAs showed significant sequence-specific silencing effects on the expression of VP1-EGFP fusion protein from plasmid pVP1-EGFP-N1, which was cotransfected with siRNA into 293T cells. Furthermore, using RT-qPCR, viral titration and viability assay, we identified VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519 that transiently acted as potent inhibitors of FMDV replication when BHK-21 cells were infected with FMDV. In addition, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, and a single nucleotide substitution was identified as the main factor in resistance to RNAi.

Here, IBV S1 and the ectodomain of NDV F proteins were separately linked with the trans-membrane and carboxy-terminal domain of IBV S protein (S(TMCT)), composing rS and rF; thus, a novel chimeric infectious bronchitis-Newcastle disease (IB-ND) virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccine containing the rS, rF, and IBV M protein was constructed. Under the transmission electron microscope (TEM), VLPs possessing similar morphology to natural IBV were observed. To evaluate the immunogenicity of chimeric IB-ND VLPs, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized with three increasing doses (50, 75, and 100 \u03BCg protein of VLPs). Results of ELISAs detecting IBV and NDV specific antibodies and IL-4 and IFN-\u03B3 T cell cytokines indicated that vaccination with chimeric IB-ND VLPs could efficiently induce humoral and cellular immune responses. In the challenge study, chimeric IB-ND VLPs (100 \u03BCg protein) provided 100% protection against IBV or NDV virulent challenge from death, and viral RNA levels in tissues and swabs were greatly reduced. Collectively, chimeric IB-ND VLPs are highly immunogenic and could provide complete protection from an IBV or NDV virulent challenge. Chimeric IB-ND VLPs are an appealing vaccine candidate and a promising vaccine platform bearing multivalent antigens.","publish_time":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xuan; Zhai, Xiwen; Lai, Yan; Zuo, Lei; Zhang, Yu; Mei, Xueran; Xiang, Rong; Kang, Zhuangzhuang; Zhou, Long; Wang, Hongning","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a19bed3bfcb373626804c55b111ca79e812efd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6465995.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","IBV S","IBV M","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunogenicity of chimeric IB-ND VLPs","\u03BCg protein of VLPs","IBV S1","natural IBV","NDV virulent challenge","carboxy-terminal domain of IBV S protein","NDV specific antibodies","novel chimeric infectious bronchitis-Newcastle disease","Newcastle disease virus","Infectious bronchitis virus","ectodomain of NDV F proteins","challenge study","rF","rS","appealing vaccine candidate","promising vaccine platform","complete protection","poultry pathogens","poultry industry","specific pathogen-free","vaccination","death","viral RNA levels","IFN-\u03B3 T cell cytokines","TEM","chickens","similar morphology","TMCT","trans-membrane","tissues","swabs","SPF","multivalent antigens","Results of ELISAs","particles","transmission electron microscope","cellular immune responses","increasing doses"],"language":"en"},

L. lactis NZ9000 containing the pNZ8148-SPVP1 recombinant plasmid was used as an oral delivery vehicle to induce anti-FMDV mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice. After confirmation that the SPVP1 protein was expressed successfully in the recombinant L. latic, the mice were orally challenged with NZ9000-pNZ8148, NZ9000-pNZ8148-SPVP1, phosphate-buffered saline as a mock infection group, or with inactivated vaccine as a positive group. Mice immunized with NZ9000-pNZ8148-SPVP1 produced high levels of mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA), antigen-specific serum IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies, and developed stronger cell-mediated immune reactions and significant T spleen lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the recombinant group generated much higher levels of IFN-\u03B3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 than the other groups.

Deafness in the corresponding mouse model, Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212), results from an abnormally enlarged cochlear lumen. The goal of this study was to determine whether the cochlear enlargement originates with defective cochlear fluid transport or with a malfunction of fluid transport in the connected compartments, which are the vestibular labyrinth and the endolymphatic sac. Embryonic inner ears from Slc26a4(\u002B/\u2212) and Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice were examined by confocal microscopy ex vivo or after 2 days of organ culture. Culture allowed observations of intact, ligated or partially resected inner ears. Cochlear lumen formation was found to begin at the base of the cochlea between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and 14.5. Enlargement was immediately evident in Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) compared to Slc26a4(\u002B/\u2212) mice. In Slc26a4(\u002B/\u2212) and Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice, separation of the cochlea from the vestibular labyrinth by ligation at E14.5 resulted in a reduced cochlear lumen. Resection of the endolymphatic sacs at E14.5 led to an enlarged cochlear lumen in Slc26a4(\u002B/\u2212) mice but caused no further enlargement of the already enlarged cochlear lumen in Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Ligation or resection performed later, at E17.5, did not alter the cochlea lumen. In conclusion, the data suggest that cochlear lumen formation is initiated by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth and temporarily controlled by fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac. Failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac due to lack of Slc26a4 expression appears to initiate cochlear enlargement in mice, and possibly humans, lacking functional Slc26a4 expression.","publish_time":"2010-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyoung-Mi; Wangemann, Philine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fadf1a77d8e94ac8611eb79cf4d0da59872d72bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2984494.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21103348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cochlear enlargement","Mutations of SLC26A4","enlarged cochlear lumen","Cochlear lumen formation","mice","reduced cochlear lumen","lack of Slc26a4 expression","cochlea lumen","functional Slc26a4 expression","defective cochlear fluid transport","fluid secretion","vestibular labyrinth","malfunction of fluid transport","Failure of fluid absorption","endolymphatic sacs","E14","Embryonic inner ears","Resection","ligation","resected inner ears","embryonic day","days of organ culture","prevalent causes of hereditary deafness","connected compartments","humans","corresponding mouse model","data","confocal microscopy ex","observations of intact","base","separation","study","conclusion","results","goal","E17"],"language":"en"},

Here we highlight recent major achievements in multiprotein complex structure research that were catalyzed by this versatile recombinant complex expression tool.","publish_time":"2013-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barford, David; Takagi, Yuichiro; Schultz, Patrick; Berger, Imre","journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/381038319b9bd8397d76640dd52e646976107a36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125881.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X13000523; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2013.03.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959440X13000523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23628287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiprotein complex production","complex molecular machines","multiprotein complex structure research","versatile recombinant complex expression tool","essential multiprotein complexes of higher eukaryotes","essential functions","baculovirus expression vector system","humans","recent major achievements","eukaryotic cells","BEVS","considerable challenge","extraction","health","disease","heterogeneity","low abundance","native source material","biological function","provision","subunits","impeding bottleneck","entirety"],"language":"en"},

Such hmAbs may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process, the mechanisms of virus neutralization and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines and research tools. The majority of the more recently developed antiviral hmAbs have come from the use of antibody phage-display technologies using both na\u00EFve and immune libraries. Many of these agents are also enveloped viruses possessing important neutralizing determinants within their membrane-anchored envelope glycoproteins and the use of recombinant, soluble versions of these viral glycoproteins is often critical in the isolation and development of antiviral hmAbs.

Despite exhaustive studies mechanistic rationale for the discriminatory preference of parallel DNA triplexes with G(*)GC \u0026 T(*)AT triplets still remains elusive. Here, we show that the highest nonisostericity between the G(*)GC \u0026 T(*)AT triplets imposes extensive stereochemical rearrangements contributing to context dependent triplex destabilisation through selective disruption of Hoogsteen scheme of hydrogen bonds. MD simulations of nineteen DNA triplexes with an assortment of sequence milieu reveal for the first time fresh insights into the nature and extent of destabilization from a single (non-overlapping), double (overlapping) and multiple pairs of nonisosteric base triplets (NIBTs). It is found that a solitary pair of NIBTs, feasible either at a G(*)GC/T(*)AT or T(*)AT/G(*)GC triplex junction, does not impinge significantly on triplex stability. But two overlapping pairs of NIBTs resulting from either a T(*)AT or a G(*)GC interruption disrupt Hoogsteen pair to a noncanonical mismatch destabilizing the triplex by ~10 to 14 kcal/mol, implying that their frequent incidence in multiples, especially, in short sequences could even hinder triplex formation. The results provide (i) an unambiguous and generalised mechanistic rationale for the discriminatory trait of parallel triplexes, including those studied experimentally (ii) clarity for the prevalence of antiparallel triplexes and (iii) comprehensive perspectives on the sequence dependent influence of nonisosteric base triplets useful in the rational design of TFO\u2019s against potential triplex target sites.","publish_time":"2016-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldsmith, Gunaseelan; Rathinavelan, Thenmalarchelvi; Yathindra, Narayanarao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/991aed7275084ce0661be421e281a8f47dcc8637.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4807104.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27010368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GC \u0026 T"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GC triplex junction","triplex formation","triplex stability","hybrid triplexes","GC interruption","overlapping pairs of NIBTs","discriminatory preference of parallel DNA triplexes","context dependent triplex destabilisation","discriminatory trait of parallel triplexes","prevalence of antiparallel triplexes","potential triplex target sites","multiple pairs of nonisosteric base triplets","sequence dependent influence of nonisosteric base triplets useful","Hoogsteen pair","Implications of DNA","solitary pair of NIBTs","non-overlapping","generalised mechanistic rationale","exhaustive studies mechanistic rationale","assortment of sequence milieu","selective disruption of Hoogsteen scheme of hydrogen bonds","rational design of TFO\u2019s","diverse biological functions","therapeutic applications","diseases","extensive stereochemical rearrangements","thorough understanding","comprehensive perspectives","nature","extent of destabilization","double","RNA","time fresh insights","noncanonical mismatch","multiples","short sequences","structure-function relationships","mol","frequent incidence","clarity","MD simulations","highest nonisostericity","kcal","results"],"language":"en"},

In particular, the infection occurs via the binary interaction between the uninfected and infected individuals. Then, the local epidemic spread can be modeled on the basis of the stochastic Boltzmann type equation. In this paper, the normalized virus titer inside the infected human body is defined as the function of the elapsed time, which is measured from the infection time. Consequently, the probability of the infection at the binary human interaction increases, as the normalized virus titer inside the human body increases, whereas the normalized virus titer inside the infected human body decreases, after the normalized virus titer reaches to its maximum value, namely, unity, in the characteristic time. Numerical results indicate that the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains depends on such a characteristic time, strongly, when the Knudsen number and temperature are fixed. Such a dependency of the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains on the characteristic time can be described by the Fisher\u2013Kolmogorov\u2013Petrovsky\u2013Piscounov equation which is introduced from the stochastic Boltzmann type equation.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edrada, Edna M.; Lopez, Edmundo B.; Villarama, Jose Benito; Salva Villarama, Eumelia P.; Dagoc, Bren F.; Smith, Chris; Sayo, Ana Ria; Verona, Jeffrey A.; Trifalgar-Arches, Jamie; Lazaro, Jezreel; Balinas, Ellen Grace M.; Telan, Elizabeth Freda O.; Roy, Lynsil; Galon, Myvie; Florida, Carl Hill N.; Ukawa, Tatsuya; Villaneuva, Annavi Marie G.; Saito, Nobuo; Nepomuceno, Jean Raphael; Ariyoshi, Koya; Carlos, Celia; Nicolasora, Amalea Dulcene; Solante, Rontgene M.","journal":"Trop Med Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35bae84d73726ef3cac95026a787e2b055433150.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308532/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00203-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["NPS/OPS","RNA"],"locations":["Philippines","San Lazaro Hospital","Manila","China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed COVID","Philippines","initial swabs","PCR","initial NPS","SARS coronavirus","initial stage","OPS swabs","suspected cases","symptoms of cough","case report","SARS-CoV","CASE PRESENTATION","new cases","human coronavirus","patients","Manila","novel coronavirus","symptoms of fever","Influenza B","viral RNA","different clinical courses","Klebsiella pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","year-old male","year-old female","patient\u2019s condition","national infectious disease referral hospital","San Lazaro Hospital","wide spectrum of disease","Staphylococcus aureus","significant past medical history","young adults","healthy Chinese nationals","sore throat","public health issues","intravenous antibiotics","vacation","epidemiological aspects","community","global pandemic","fatalities","BACKGROUND","infection","cardiac arrest","Continued vigilance","Physical examination","chills","CONCLUSIONS","death","China","intubation","couple"],"language":"en"},

Midturbinate (MT) swabs are an alternative due to their ease of collection and possible self-collection by patients. The objective of this study was to compare the respiratory virus isolation of flocked MT swabs compared to flocked NP swabs. METHODS: Beginning in October 2008, healthy adults aged 18 to 69 years were recruited into a cohort and followed up for symptoms of influenza. They were asked to have NP and MT swabs taken as soon as possible after the onset of a fever or two or more respiratory symptoms with an acute onset. The swabs were tested for viral respiratory infections using Seeplex\u00AE RV12 multiplex PCR detection kit. Seventy six pairs of simultaneous NP and MT swabs were collected from 38 symptomatic subjects. Twenty nine (38%) of these pairs were positive by either NP or MT swabs or both. Sixty nine (91%) of the pair results were concordant. Two samples (3%) for hCV OC43/HKU1 and 1 sample (1%) for rhinovirus A/B were positive by NP but negative by MT. One sample each for hCV 229E/NL63, hCV OC43/HKU1, respiratory syncytial virus A, and influenza B were positive by MT but negative by NP. CONCLUSIONS: Flocked MT swabs are sensitive for the diagnosis of multiple respiratory viruses. Given the ease of MT collection and similar results between the two swabs, it is likely that MT swabs should be the preferred method of respiratory cell collection for outpatient studies. In light of this data, larger studies should be performed to ensure that this still holds true and data should also be collected on the patient preference of collection methods.","publish_time":"2011-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larios, Oscar E.; Coleman, Brenda L.; Drews, Steven J.; Mazzulli, Tony; Borgundvaag, Bjug; Green, Karen; McGeer, Allison J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c46da8970ae5d4e6b3b1f4d4d30a2ea426d1ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3121745.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21731708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","MT."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flocked NP swabs","respiratory virus isolation of flocked MT swabs","ease of MT collection","respiratory symptoms","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory virus testing","ease of collection","pairs of simultaneous NP","viral respiratory infections","preferred method of respiratory cell collection","diagnosis of multiple respiratory viruses","hCV OC43","possible self-collection","patient preference of collection methods","HKU1","influenza B","symptoms of influenza","data","outpatient studies","similar results","larger studies","pair results","acute onset","Seeplex","RV12 multiplex PCR detection kit","gold standard","NL63","patients","CONCLUSIONS","years","light","BACKGROUND","rhinovirus","study","fever","symptomatic subjects","healthy adults","cohort","Midturbinate","healthcare worker","objective","samples"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yan; Zhang, Jinyong; Wang, Ning; Li, Haibo; Shi, Yun; Guo, Gang; Liu, Kaiyun; Zeng, Hao; Zou, Quanming","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2377c6f10cd9d0f444b4c5cb67b05d9ef4ffbdd0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c6ec1380338cb2467dc6fc14add09ca5bea18411.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.922922","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV","main protease of SARS","SARS-CoV main protease","key protease","main proteaseof","infection","clinical drug libraries","clinical applications","drug development","effective means","high binding capacity","high-throughput screening","small molecular drugs","effective immune strategy","specific inhibitors","features","life cycle","replication","proliferation","outbreak of pneumonia","guaranteed safety","Wuhan","transmissibility","severity","contrast","therapeutic antibody","pathogen","attractive target","cause","promising candidates","Investigations","vaccine","China","epidemic","Novel Coronavirus","similarity","time","study"],"language":"en"},

The manuscript covers approaches to the synthesis of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone derivatives: modification of the C5 position of the basic core; synthesis of the target compounds in the one-pot or multistage reactions or transformation of other related heterocycles. The most prominent pharmacological profiles of 5-ene derivatives of different 4-thiazolidinone subtypes belonging to hit-, lead-compounds, drug-candidates and drugs as well as the most studied targets have been discussed. Currently target compounds (especially 5-en-rhodanines) are assigned as frequent hitters or pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) within high-throughput screening campaigns. Nevertheless, the crucial impact of the presence/nature of C5 substituent (namely 5-ene) on the pharmacological effects of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones was confirmed by the numerous listed findings from the original articles. The main directions for active 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones optimization have been shown: i) complication of the fragment in the C5 position; ii) introduction of the substituents in the N3 position (especially fragments with carboxylic group or its derivatives); iii) annealing in complex heterocyclic systems; iv) combination with other pharmacologically attractive fragments within hybrid pharmacophore approach. Moreover, the utilization of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones in the synthesis of complex compounds with potent pharmacological application is described. The chemical transformations cover mainly the reactions which involve the exocyclic double bond in C5 position of the main core and correspond to the abovementioned direction of the 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone modification.","publish_time":"2017-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaminskyy, Danylo; Kryshchyshyn, Anna; Lesyk, Roman","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/865df08c45ad94c077c8ff7fe4ea69d9ede16a18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111298.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523417307456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28987611/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523417307456; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.09.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C5 position","ene derivatives of different","target compounds","synthesis of complex compounds","lead-compounds","thiazolidinone derivatives","N3 position","thiazolidinone modification","thiazolidinones optimization","pan-assay interference compounds","nature of C5 substituent","main core","pharmacological effects","thiazolidinone subtypes","potent pharmacological application","prominent pharmacological profiles","basic core","attractive fragments","multistage reactions","main directions","studied targets","complex heterocyclic systems","PAINS","frequent hitters","exocyclic double bond","presence","combination","numerous listed findings","class of small molecules","carboxylic group","high-throughput screening campaigns","attempt","original articles","hybrid pharmacophore approach","drug-candidates","drugs","introduction","medicinal chemistry","related heterocycles","abovementioned direction","huge volume of data","crucial impact","substituents","en-rhodanines","presented review","chemical transformations","manuscript","approaches","complication","utilization"],"language":"en"},

Because of deviation from icosahedral symmetry, KSHV portal and tegument structures have largely been obscured in previous studies. Using symmetry-relaxed cryo-EM, we determined the in situ structure of the KSHV portal and its interactions with surrounding capsid proteins, CATCs, and the terminal end of KSHV\u2019s dsDNA genome. Our atomic models of the portal and capsid/CATC, together with visualization of CATCs\u2019 variable occupancy and alternate orientation of CATC-interacting vertex triplexes, suggest a mechanism whereby the portal orchestrates procapsid formation and asymmetric long-range determination of CATC attachment during DNA packaging prior to pleomorphic tegumentation/envelopment.

Following extensive consultation, they were published in January 2001.1 These guidelines describe the precautions healthcare workers should take in three areas: standard principles for preventing HCAI, which include hospital environmental hygiene, hand hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, and the safe use and disposal of sharps; preventing infections associated with the use of short-term indwelling urethral catheters; and preventing infections associated with central venous catheters. The evidence for these guidelines was identified by multiple systematic reviews of experimental and non-experimental research and expert opinion as reflected in systematically identified professional, national and international guidelines, which were formally assessed by a validated appraisal process. In 2003, we developed complementary national guidelines for preventing HCAI in primary and community care on behalf of the National Collaborating Centre for Nursing and Supportive Care (National Institute for Healthand Clinical Excellence).2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective in preventing HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. Consequently, the DH commissioned a review of new evidence published following the last systematic reviews. We have now updated the evidence base for making infection prevention and control recommendations. A critical assessment of the updated evidence indicated that the original epic guidelines published in 2001 remain robust, relevant and appropriate but that adjustments need to be made to some guideline recommendations following a synopsis of the evidence underpinning the guidelines. These updated national guidelines (epic2) provide comprehensive recommendations for preventing HCAI in hospitals and other acute care settings based on the best currently available evidence. Because this is not always the best possible evidence, we have included a suggested agenda for further research in each section of the guidelines. National evidence-based guidelines are broad principles of best practice which need to be integrated into local practice guidelines. To monitor implementation, we have suggested key audit criteria for each section of recommendations. Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of protecting patients.

The emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has been linked to neurological complications, including encephalopathy and encephalitis. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: We reviewed case management of a 20-year old Hispanic male who developed febrile upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms followed by a confusional state. He had rapid neurologic decline and his clinical course was complicated by refractory seizures and malignant brain edema. He was managed with oseltamavir and peramavir, corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin treatment, anticonvulsants, intracranial pressure management with external ventricular drain placement, hyperosmolar therapy, sedation, and mechanical ventilation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasal secretions confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for 2009 H1N1 viral RNA. Follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement in brain edema but restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia. We provide a review of the clinical spectrum of neurologic complications of seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1, and current approaches towards managing these complications. CONCLUSIONS: 2009 H1N1-associated acute encephalitis and encephalopathy appear to be variable in severity, including a subset of patients with a malignant clinical course complicated by high morbidity and mortality. Since the H1N1 influenza virus has not been detected in the CSF or brain tissue in patients with this diagnosis, the emerging view is that the host immune response plays a key role in pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akins, Paul Taylor; Belko, John; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Axelrod, Yekaterina; Lee, Kenneth K.; Silverthorn, James","journal":"Neurocrit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fa36c857c0d2d78e7a42e369d0ee241e2087855.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 influenza virus","H1N1 virus infection","Influenza virus infection","clinical spectrum of neurologic complications of seasonal influenza","range of neurologic complications","H1N1 viral RNA","pandemic influenza","neurological complications","malignant clinical course","malignant brain edema","case management","brain tissue","encephalopathy","CSF","rapid neurologic decline","subset of patients","Case report","literature review","acute encephalitis","febrile upper respiratory tract signs","intracranial pressure management","external ventricular drain placement","anticonvulsants","hyperosmolar therapy","intravenous gamma globulin treatment","Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasal secretions","symptoms","year old Hispanic male","host immune response","corticosteroids","sedation","restricted diffusion","improvement","refractory seizures","key role","peramavir","emerging view","diagnosis","high morbidity","cerebrospinal fluid","METHODS","severity","Follow-up imaging","mechanical ventilation","basal ganglia","current approaches","pathogenesis","oseltamavir","mortality","BACKGROUND","confusional state","emergence","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Inherited and acquired variability in host immune responses may influence susceptibility and outcome of IVI. However, the molecular basis of such human factors remains largely elusive. It has been proposed that homozygosity for IFITM3 rs12252-C is associated with a population-attributable risk of 5.4 % for severe IVI in Northern Europeans and 54.3 % for severe H1N1pdm infection in Chinese. A total of 148 patients with confirmed IVI were considered for recruitment; 118 Spanish patients (60 of them hospitalized with PVP) and 246 healthy Spanish individuals were finally included in the statistical analysis. PCR-RFLP was used with confirmation by Sanger sequencing. The allele frequency for rs12252-C was found to be 3.5 % among the general Spanish population. We found no rs12252-C homozygous individuals in our control group. The only Spanish patient homozygous for rs12252-C had a neurological disorder (a known risk factor for severe IVI) and mild influenza. Our data do not suggest a role of rs12252-C in the development of severe IVI in our population. These data may be relevant to recognize whether patients homozygous for rs12252-C are at risk of severe influenza, and hence require individualized measures in the case of IVI.","publish_time":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Rodr\u00EDguez, M.; Herrera-Ramos, E.; Sol\u00E9-Viol\u00E1n, J.; Ru\u00EDz-Hern\u00E1ndez, J.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicates up to 10% of pulmonary blastomycosis in hospitalized patients and carries a mortality of 50-90%. This report describes the clinical course of four consecutive patients with blastomycosis-related ARDS treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during 2009-2014. CLINICAL FEATURES: Four adults were referred from northwestern Ontario, Canada with progressive respiratory illnesses. All patients developed diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiography and required mechanical ventilation within 6-72 hr. Patients satisfied Berlin criteria for severe ARDS with trough P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratios of 44-61 on positive end-expiratory pressure of 12-24 cm H(2)O. Wet mount microscopy from respiratory samples showed broad-based yeast consistent with B.dermatitidis. Despite lung protective ventilation strategies with maximal F(i)O(2) (patients A-D), neuromuscular blockade (patients A-D), inhaled nitric oxide (patients A and D), and prone positioning (patient D), progressive hypoxemia resulted in initiation of venovenous ECMO by hours 24-90 of mechanical ventilation with subsequent de-escalation of ventilatory support. In all four cases, ECMO decannulation was performed (7-23 days), mechanical ventilation was withdrawn (18-52 days), and the patients survived to hospital discharge (31-87 days). CONCLUSION: This report describes the successful application of ECMO as rescue therapy in aid of four patients with refractory blastomycosis-associated ARDS. In addition to early appropriate antimicrobial therapy, transfer to an institution experienced with ECMO should be considered when caring for patients from endemic areas with rapidly progressive respiratory failure.","publish_time":"2015-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bednarczyk, Joseph M.; Kethireddy, Shravan; White, Christopher W.; Freed, Darren H.; Singal, Rohit K.; Bell, Dean; Ahmed, Syed Zaki; Kumar, Anand; Light, Bruce","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41407066bd81d0aeab3adb50cdfa0cf46782d98f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Blastomyces"],"organizations":["ARDS","ECMO"],"locations":["North America","Canada","Berlin"],"keyphrases":["consecutive patients","hospitalized patients","mechanical ventilation","progressive respiratory failure","respiratory samples","progressive respiratory illnesses","ECMO decannulation","days","blastomycosis-related ARDS","fatal respiratory failure","initiation of venovenous ECMO","severe ARDS","patient D","successful application of ECMO","refractory blastomycosis-associated ARDS","progressive hypoxemia","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","pulmonary blastomycosis","report","lung protective ventilation strategies","rescue therapy","endemic areas","Blastomyces dermatitidis","maximal F","clinical course","CLINICAL FEATURES","dimorphic fungus endemic","venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","early appropriate antimicrobial therapy","North America capable","broad-based yeast consistent","chest radiography","transfer","aid","Wet mount microscopy","trough P","northwestern Ontario","Berlin criteria","diffuse bilateral opacities","Canada","hours","subsequent de-escalation of ventilatory support","prone positioning","neuromuscular blockade","adults","addition","institution","nitric oxide","positive end-expiratory pressure","PURPOSE","hospital discharge","CONCLUSION","ratios","cases","mortality"],"language":"en"},

The aim of our study was to construct a sensitive and specific real-time quantitative fluorescent (QF) reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR method for the detection of SARS-CoV RNA. Methods: Stored blood specimens from 44 patients with confirmed SARS were used along with blood samples from two sets of controls, 30 healthy volunteers who had no contact with SARS patients, and 30 healthy doctors and nurses who had contact with SARS patients but were without symptoms of SARS. Two pairs of primers were synthesized by the Shanghai Sangon Company according to SARS-CoV BJ01 strain sequence (AY278488), and then a pair of primers were designed and compared with a pair of primers published by WHO. Results: Using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV, the 44 blood samples from SARS patients specimens were tested. Using a 0.01% dilution of SARS-CoV, all 44 clinical samples tested positive in our assay. In comparison, using a 0.1% dilution of SARS-CoV, 26 of the 44 samples tested positive using the WHO primers. In the QF-RT-PCR assay, there was a linear amplification from 100 copies to 10(8) copies of the control RNA per RT-PCR and at least 10 copies, and sometimes even 1 copy, of target RNA tested positive in our assay. Conclusion: The primer we developed is sufficiently sensitive and specific to diagnose symptomatic SARS-CoV infections and for monitoring virus load.","publish_time":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Weijun; Xu, Zuyuan; Mu, Jingsong; He, Bo; Yang, Ling; Lin, Lin; Meng, Shufang; Mu, Feng; Gan, Haixue; Huang, Shengyong; Wen, Jie; Fang, Jianqiu; Wang, Jian","journal":"Mol Diagn","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9110b6136dafccd5110c9d56f30e97b5356afa7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed SARS","dilution of SARS","detection of SARS","symptoms of SARS","SARS patients specimens","symptomatic SARS-CoV infections","serial dilutions of SARS","SARS-associated coronavirus","CoV RNA","SARS-CoV BJ01 strain sequence","blood samples","RT-PCR","PCR assay","copies","pair of primers","QF-RT","clinical samples","pairs of primers","Stored blood specimens","PCR method","target RNA","control RNA","contact","aim","healthy volunteers","healthy doctors","specific real-time quantitative fluorescent","reverse transcriptase","severe acute respiratory syndrome","AY278488","sets of controls","Shanghai Sangon Company","monitoring virus load","pathogen","copy","nurses","linear amplification","Methods","Results","study","Conclusion","comparison"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that MHV could undergo RNA-RNA recombination in crosses between temperature-sensitive mutants and wild-type viruses at a very high frequency (S. Makino, J. G. Keck, S. A. Stohlman, and M. M. C. Lai (1986) J. Virol. 57, 729\u2013737). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different sets of MHV strains. Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5\u2032-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5\u2032-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5\u2032-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5\u2032-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of \u201Ccopy-choice\u201D recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.","publish_time":"1987-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keck, James G.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Side, Lisa H.; Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44d0047d1ba9c5315821d85a1a7037ed11021033.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287904132; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287904132","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

To study its subcellular localization, ORF of protein \u03B1 with 338 aa was fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and was detected in transfected cells in the absence of other viral proteins. In both SB and Cos-7 cells, protein \u03B1 was found to localize EGFP to the nucleolus and cytoplasm. Deletion mutants of protein \u03B1 indicated that N-terminal 43 amino acid residues were required to import EGFP-\u03B1 protein into the nucleolus. Further deletions within the 43 amino acid backbone, EGFP/33aa(1\u201333) and EGFP/30aa(14\u201343), localized to the nucleolus, suggesting that the 20 amino acids from 14 to 33 of protein \u03B1 were the domain of nucleolus localization. To further determine the nucleolus targeting sequence, deletion mutations within the 20 amino acids of protein \u03B1 were constructed. It was found that the deletion of 23RRR25, 29RRR31, or 23RRRANNRRR31 prevented the accumulation of EGFP fusion proteins into the nucleolus, demonstrating that 23RRRANNRRR31 contain the signal required for nucleolar localization. A similar distribution pattern of localization of protein \u03B1 and its deletion mutants in SB and Cos-7 cells suggested that N-terminal residues of protein \u03B1 23RRRANNRRR31 constitute a nucleolus localization signal that functions in both fish and mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Yan Xiang; Dallmann, Klara; Kwang, Jimmy","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ef00193253adac155755ab427cefe87e0672a58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126641.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202000818; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202000818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SB","ORF","EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGFP-\u03B1 protein","ORF of protein \u03B1","Deletion mutants of protein \u03B1","amino acids of protein \u03B1","nucleolus localization signal","N-terminal residues of protein \u03B1 23RRRANNRRR31","domain of nucleolus localization","virus capsid protein","transfected cells of SB","enhanced green fluorescent protein","mammalian cells","subcellular localization","Cos","nucleolar localization","amino acid residues","deletion mutations","accumulation of EGFP fusion proteins","deletion of 23RRR25","amino acid backbone","cytoplasm of infected cells of Asian sea bass","similar distribution pattern of localization","viral proteins","Epinephelus tauvina","nervous necrosis viruses","GGNNV","Abstract Betanodavirus greasy grouper","functions","gene","fish","29RRR31","absence","deletions","pcDNA3","sequence","RNA2"],"language":"en"},

From this system, all cattle-disease records are transferred to the dairy industry cattle database (DDD) where they are used for several purposes including research and dairy-health statistics. Our objective was to evaluate the completeness of this data source by comparing it with disease data registered by dairy farmers. The proportion of veterinary-treated disease events was estimated, by diagnosis. Disease incidence in the DDD was compared, by diagnosis and age, with disease data registered by the farmers. Comparison was made, by diagnosis, for (i) all disease events and (ii) those reported as veterinary-treated. Disease events, defined as \u201Cobserved deviations in health, from the normal\u201D were recorded by the farmers during January, April, July and October 2004. For the diagnoses calving problems, peripartum disorders, puerperal paresis and retained placenta, incidence proportions (IP) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. For all other disease problems, incidence rates (IR) were used. In total, 177 farmers reported at least 1 month and 148 reported all 4 months. Fifty-four percent of all disease events in the farmers\u2019 data were reported as veterinary-treated. For several of the most common diagnoses, the IRs and IPs for all events were significantly higher in farmers\u2019 data than in the DDD. Examples are, in cows: clinical mastitis, cough, gastro-intestinal disorders and lameness in hoof and limb; and in young stock: cough and gastro-intestinal disorders. For veterinary-treated events only, significant differences with higher IR in the farmers\u2019 data were found in young stock for sporadic cough and sporadic gastro-intestinal disorders. The diagnosis \u201Cother disorders\u201D had significantly more events in the DDD than in farmers\u2019 data, i.e. veterinarians tended to choose more unspecific diagnoses than the farmers. This result indicates that the true completeness is likely to be higher than our estimate. We conclude that for the time period studied there was differential under-reporting associated with the diagnosis, the age of the animal and whether the herd was served by a state-employed or private veterinarian.","publish_time":"2009-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00F6rk, M.; Lindberg, A.; Alenius, S.; V\u00E5gsholm, I.; Egenvall, A.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59e6dfead3d50788eb626a32f19305afce88bc63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114122.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587708002523; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587708002523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19178966/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.12.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DDD","IRs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease data","treated disease events","Disease incidence","disease problems","farmers\u2019 data","national disease","veterinary-treated events","diagnosis","cattle-disease records","data source","DDD","dairy farmers","veterinary reporting","sporadic gastro-intestinal disorders","peripartum disorders","proportion of veterinary","sporadic cough","higher IR","young stock","dairy-health statistics","incidence proportions","incidence rates","system","common diagnoses","unspecific diagnoses","age","dairy industry cattle database","true completeness","differential under-reporting","puerperal paresis","placenta","significant differences","clinical mastitis","limb","hoof","lameness","IPs","cows","research","IRs","observed deviations","veterinarians","time period","state","confidence intervals","purposes","Abstract Sweden","animal","private veterinarian","CIs","herd","Examples","result","estimate","percent","months","objective","total","Comparison"],"language":"en"},

Questionnaires are usually built de novo for each event, resulting in substantially delayed epidemiological responses that are detrimental to the understanding and control of the event considered. Moreover, the public health and/or academic institution databases constructed with responses to different questionnaires are usually difficult to merge, impairing necessary collaborations. We aimed to show that e-commerce concepts and software tools can be readily adapted to enable rapid collection of data after an infectious disease outbreak or environmental disaster. Here, the \u2018customers\u2019 are the epidemiologists, who fill their shopping \u2018baskets\u2019 with standardised questions. METHODS: For each epidemiological field, a catalogue of questions is constituted by identifying the relevant variables based on a review of the published literature on similar circumstances. Each question is tagged with information on its source papers. Epidemiologists can then tailor their own questionnaires by choosing appropriate questions from this catalogue. The software immediately provides them with ready-to-use forms and online questionnaires. All databases constituted by the different EpiBasket users are interoperable, because the corresponding questionnaires are derived from the same corpus of questions. RESULTS: A proof-of-concept prototype was developed for Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) surveys, which is one of the fields of the epidemiological investigation frequently explored during, or after, an outbreak or environmental disaster. The catalogue of questions was initiated from a review of the KAP studies conducted during or after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. CONCLUSION: Rapid collection of standardised data after an outbreak or environmental disaster can be facilitated by transposing the e-commerce paradigm to epidemiology, taking advantage of the powerful software tools already available.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Weijia; Hejblum, Gilles; Valleron, Alain-Jacques","journal":"Emerg Health Threats J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6460342e18e6d3fea8f62630e12b083d46a6eb99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3816197.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24183326/; https://doi.org/10.3402/ehtj.v6i0.19748","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["environmental disaster","catalogue of questions","different questionnaires","standardised questions","collection of epidemiological data","epidemiological responses","corresponding questionnaires","appropriate questions","online questionnaires","corpus of questions","rapid collection of data","Rapid collection of standardised data","epidemiological field","epidemiological investigation","emerging infectious disease outbreak","review","powerful software tools","epidemiologists","e-commerce paradigm","e-commerce concepts","KAP studies","academic institution databases","different EpiBasket users","advantage","Knowledge","Attitudes","severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic","published literature","Practice","epidemiology","understanding","shopping","CONCLUSION","concept prototype","similar circumstances","public health","information","proof","control","surveys","forms","BACKGROUND","baskets\u2019","relevant variables","source papers","necessary collaborations","fields","METHODS","novo","event\u0027s onset","RESULTS","customers\u2019"],"language":"en"},

Growing data volumes pose significant challenges for information processing systems in research centers. Additionally, the routines of genomics laboratory are typically characterized by high parallelism in testing and constant procedure changes. RESULTS: This paper describes a formal approach to address this challenge through the implementation of a genetic testing management system applied to human genome laboratory. We introduced the Human Genome Research Center Information System (CEGH) in Brazil, a system that is able to support constant changes in human genome testing and can provide patients updated results based on the most recent and validated genetic knowledge. Our approach uses a common repository for process planning to ensure reusability, specification, instantiation, monitoring, and execution of processes, which are defined using a relational database and rigorous control flow specifications based on process algebra (ACP). The main difference between our approach and related works is that we were able to join two important aspects: 1) process scalability achieved through relational database implementation, and 2) correctness of processes using process algebra. Furthermore, the software allows end users to define genetic testing without requiring any knowledge about business process notation or process algebra. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the CEGH information system that is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) based on a formal framework to support genetic testing management for Mendelian disorder studies. We have proved the feasibility and showed usability benefits of a rigorous approach that is able to specify, validate, and perform genetic testing using easy end user interfaces.","publish_time":"2011-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ara\u00FAjo, Luciano V; Malkowski, Simon; Braghetto, Kelly R; Passos-Bueno, Maria R; Zatz, Mayana; Pu, Calton; Ferreira, Jo\u00E3o E","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d79628296e95343f9d5557983d7e19b66145b384.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3287582.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-12-s4-s13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEGH","Laboratory Information Management System"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["genetic testing management system","process algebra","human genome testing","Laboratory Information Management System","CEGH information system","process scalability","genetic knowledge","Human Genome Research Center Information System","human genome laboratory","rigorous approach","formal approach","development of new testing systems","business process notation","information processing systems","constant changes","relational database implementation","paper","RESULTS","constant procedure changes","routines of genomics laboratory","research centers","formal framework","clinical data","end users","correctness of processes","execution of processes","Growing data volumes","rigorous control flow specifications","easy end user interfaces","significant challenges","biological technology advances","high parallelism","LIMS","monitoring","varied amounts of molecular","reusability","Mendelian disorder studies","Brazil","related works","instantiation","BACKGROUND","usability benefits","important aspects","patients","main difference","common repository","software","ACP","feasibility","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age \u003C 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (C(max)) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (T(max)) were observed. Nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half-time (AAP t(1/2)) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [564 \u00B1 96 min vs. 393 \u00B1 84 min, respectively; P = 0.04] and lower area under the concentration curve values (e.g., 60 min postprandial AUC(60) 681 \u00B1 244 (\u00B5g\u2219min)/mL vs. 1064 \u00B1 23 (\u00B5g\u2219min)/mL, respectively; P = 0.04). In conclusion, abomasal luminal conditions were different between diarrheic and healthy calves. Significant differences in APAT reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves. Impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves, which should be considered in management of their feeding.","publish_time":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hildebrandt, Thomas; Scheuch, Eberhard; Weitschies, Werner; Grimm, Michael; Schneider, Felix; Bachmann, Lisa; Vervuert, Ingrid","journal":"Livest Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102753.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2017.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288872/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141317301932; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141317301932","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrheic calves","healthy calves","diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves","Abomasal pH","higher abomasal temperature","APAT","abomasal luminal conditions","abomasal luminal parameters","Impaired abomasal movement","maximum acetaminophen concentrations","luminal pH","intraluminal temperature","intraluminal pressure","longer acetaminophen half-time","acetaminophen absorption test","significant differences","WAC","study","\u00B5g","lower area","AAP t","concentration curve values","enhanced bacterial fermentation processes","delay","Nonlinear regression findings","wireless ambulatory capsule","body weight","suckling","days","abomasum","conclusion","blood samples","hours","milk replacer","postprandial AUC","h period","management","feeding","rate"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Observational study of 412 children visiting an outpatient clinic of a Dutch teaching hospital. Results: From August to December 2009, 412 children were tested at the clinic; 32% proved H1N1\u2010positive, confirmed by reverse\u2010transcriptase\u2010polymerase\u2010chain\u2010reaction (RT\u2010PCR). Pathogens were detected in 65% of samples. Influenza A(H1N1) (n = 132), human rhinovirus (n = 55), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 45) and adenovirus (n = 34) were mostly identified. Co\u2010infections were seen in 34 children (8.3%). Mean age was 6.8 and 4.2 years in H1N1\u2010positive and H1N1\u2010negative cases, respectively (p \u003C 0.01). H1N1\u2010positive outpatient children reported fever, cough and rhinorrhoea more frequently than their H1N1\u2010negative counterparts. Of 72 hospitalized children, 31% proved H1N1\u2010positive; all showed a relatively mild clinical illness. None of the children had been admitted to an intensive care unit or died.

GGD was more effective when given before the viral infection and targeted the viral attachment and replication stages rather than the internalization stage. In vivo, GGD treatment reduced thevirus titers of lung tissue significantly and improved the survival rate, lung index, and pulmonary histopathological changes in H1N1-infected mice. We observed the changes in several key immuno-related indexes in GGD administrated H1N1-infected mice with anti-IAV drug oseltamivir phosphate as the control. GGD treatment decreased the expression of TNF-\u03B1 and improved Th1/Th2 immune balance to reduce the excessive immune response in H1N1-infected mice. Besides, the expression of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway in H1N1-infected mice decreased after GGD treatment.

The disease quickly spread to countries around the world and was transmitted in healthcare settings. Infection control professionals had to formulate a response to potential cases of SARS presenting to healthcare facilities. OBJECTIVE: To formulate and operationalize a plan for education and training of staff and to ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and adherence to infection control protocols to prevent SARS transmission in a large urban healthcare institution. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force was charged with maintaining up-to-date knowledge about the SARS epidemic and providing education and training to staff in the hospital and outlying clinics. Signage for SARS triage and SARS isolation was created. Policies and checklists were developed for designated patient areas, and SARS carts and boxes stocked with PPE were obtained for these areas. A new \u201Cobserver\u201D role was created to ensure adherence to isolation procedures when caring for SARS patients. An educational video was made for distribution to healthcare workers. RESULTS: The SARS task force developed a cohesive package of policies, procedures, signage, and patient education in multiple languages. We developed a system to supply PPE and education to staff who might care for SARS patients. A new video will make staff education more accessible, especially for those working off-site or during nontraditional hours. CONCLUSION: The SARS task force responded to an emerging infectious threat and is a model for continued response to potential biological emergencies.","publish_time":"2004-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haas\u2217, J.; Saiman, L.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655304001932; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655304001932","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","PPE"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","SARS isolation","SARS patients","SARS transmission","SARS carts","SARS triage","SARS task force","potential cases of SARS","staff education","patient education","PPE","training of staff","healthcare facilities","healthcare settings","healthcare workers","multidisciplinary task force","Signage","adherence","isolation procedures","new video","large urban healthcare institution","designated patient areas","infection control protocols","Infection control professionals","continued response","educational video","cohesive package of policies","potential biological emergencies","model","emerging infectious threat","availability of personal protective equipment","severe acute respiratory syndrome","up-to-date knowledge","distribution","hospital","checklists","boxes","multiple languages","world","outlying clinics","role","METHODS","plan","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","countries","observer","system","China","Abstract BACKGROUND","nontraditional hours","disease","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

It is documented that the virus can be transmitted to newborn babies from their mothers. We consider a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of the Zika virus infectious disease that spreads in, both humans and vectors, through horizontal and vertical transmission. The total populations of both humans and mosquitoes are assumed to be constant. Our models consist of a system of eight differential equations describing the human and vector populations during the different stages of the disease. We have included the hospitalization/isolation class in our model to see the effect of the controlling strategy. We determine the expression for the basic reproductive number R 0 in terms of horizontal as well as vertical disease transmission rates. An in-depth stability analysis of the model is performed, and it is consequently shown, that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number R 0 \u003C 1. It is also shown that when R 0 \u003E 1, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We showed that the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. We were able to prove this result in a reduced model. Furthermore, we conducted an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to recognize the impact of crucial model parameters on R 0. The uncertainty analysis yields an estimated value of the basic reproductive number R 0 = 1.54.

METHODS: Using Danish medical databases, we included all patients with a first-time hospital diagnosis of ON during 1995\u20132012. Each ON case was matched with 10 randomly selected population control subjects from general population. For all participants, we obtained a complete hospital history of comorbidities included in the CharlsonComorbidity Index 5 years preceding the inclusion date. RESULTS: 4107 ON cases and 41 063 controls were included. The incidence of ON increased from 3.9 in 1995 to 5.5 in 2012 per 100 000 inhabitants. Solid cancer was the most common comorbidity, associated with an adjusted OR (aOR) for ON of 2.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.2). For advanced metastatic cancer, leukaemia and lymphoma, aORs of ON were 3.4 (95% CI 2.5 to 4.5), 4.3 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.0) and 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.8), respectively. Among other chronic conditions, aORs were 3.5 (95% CI 3.0 to 4.1) for connective tissue diseases and 2.3 (95% CI 2.0 to 2.7) for chronic pulmonary diseases. aORs were also increased at 2.8 (95% CI 1.9 to 4.1) and 4.5 (95% CI 2.5 to 8.2) for mild and moderate-to-severe liver disease, respectively, and 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.2) for renal disease. CONCLUSION: This large population-based study provides evidence for an increasing ON incidence in the general population and documents an association between several common comorbid conditions and risk of ON.","publish_time":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dima, Alina; Pedersen, Alma Becic; Pedersen, Lars; Baicus, Cristian; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d43c9028fc460b667d7b8e54c16f0a85de6f3c4d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c8d6b93a43ec16e86c706d638d1de31ffd961588.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5829903.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29439082/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020680","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Denmark"],"keyphrases":["general population","aORs","population-based setting","large population-based study","selected population control subjects","different common comorbidities association","common comorbidity","common comorbid conditions","incidence of osteonecrosis","chronic conditions","chronic pulmonary diseases","complete hospital history of comorbidities","Solid cancer","renal disease","advanced metastatic cancer","first-time hospital diagnosis","severe liver disease","connective tissue diseases","evidence","increasing","patients","CharlsonComorbidity Index","leukaemia","lymphoma","recent time trends","years","Denmark","Danish medical databases","inclusion date","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","risk","CONCLUSION","cases","participants","RESULTS","controls","inhabitants"],"language":"en"},

Infection with porcine cytomegalovirus and enterovirus, serotype V13, was universal in both herds. In herd A, as neonatal antibody to PCMV and reovirus type 3 declined, the majority of pigs became infected with these viruses at five to eight weeks and 11 weeks respectively. The majority of pigs showed seroconversion to these viruses. Enteroviruses were excreted continuously from eight weeks and one adenovirus was isolated at 11 weeks. In herd B, a similar pattern of PCMV excretion and antibody development was found in one group of pigs but infection in the other group occurred much earlier and all pigs in this group had a poor antibody response following infection. The coronavirus of vomiting-and-wasting disease (VWD) was isolated from some three-week-old pigs which had moderate, rising antibody titres. Adenoviruses, including type 4, and enteroviruses were also recovered from pigs at an earlier age than those in herd A and in addition a parvovirus was isolated. Porcine cytomegalovirus, porcine adenovirus type 4 and the coronavirus (VWD) were considered to be the only viruses which may have been directly associated with the respiratory disease. Of the other viruses isolated only an enterovirus, serotype F34, had a tenuous link with respiratory disease.","publish_time":"1978-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watt, R.

A total of 372 tissues or serum samples collected from pigs distributed in 9 provinces/municipalities of China during the period from February 2011 to November 2012 were assayed for T. gondii antigens and antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, while the PCR was designed for the detection of the PRRSV, CSFV and PCV-2, respectively. The total positive rate of T. gondii, PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 9.14% (34/372), 50.00% (186/372), 37.10% (138/372) and 3.23% (12/372), respectively. Among the 34 T. gondii positive samples, 26 samples were simultaneously infected with T. gondii and viruses, while the remaining eight samples were infected with T. gondii alone. In addition, the co-infection rate of T. gondii with PRSSV, T. gondii with PRSSV and CSFV, T. gondii with PRSSV and PCV-2, T. gondii with CSFV and PCV-2, T. gondii with PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 1.61% (6/372), 4.03% (15/372), 0.27% (1/372), 0.27% (1/372) and 0.81% (3/372), respectively. The results of the present survey revealed that PRRSV and CSFV were the common pathogens co-existing with porcine toxoplasmosis in China, and both of them could increase the chances of T. gondii infection in pig. This is the first report of T. gondii co-infections with viruses in pigs. It is very important to understand the interactions of parasite and virus, and can be used as reference data for the control and prevention of co-infections of T. gondii and viruses in pigs.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"WANG, Shuai; ZHANG, Meng; LIU, Xin-chao; LIN, Tao; YANG, Han-chun; YUAN, Shi-shan; ZHAO, Guang-wei; IA, Hassan; YAN, Ruo-feng; SONG, Xiao-kai; XU, Li-xin; LI, Xiang-rui","journal":"Journal of Integrative Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8d7631a2657a1784c9cdc9179e2085935615014.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095311915610449; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119(15)61044-9; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311915610449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","CSFV","PRSSV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["gondii antigens","gondii co-infections","CSFV","gondii positive samples","PCV","prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection","PRSSV","pigs","co-infection rate","PRRSV","viruses","prevention of co-infections","serum samples","porcine toxoplasmosis","common pathogens co-existing","total positive rate","municipalities of China","respiratory syndrome virus","porcine circovirus type","classical swine fever virus","present survey","present investigation","enzyme","immunosorbent assay","ELISA","antibodies","control","technique","tissues","PCR","reference data","interactions of parasite","provinces","detection","chances","addition","report","objective","results","period"],"language":"en"},

National health insurance and national health services of various models have evolved in the developed world and increasingly in developing countries as well. Some models, such as the Bismarckian social security model and the Bereidge National Health Service model, or National Health insurance such as in pioneered in Canada, are used by a number of countries. The common features are based on principles of national responsibility and solidarity for health, social solidarity for providing funding and searching for effective ways of providing care. Various universal systems of health coverage exist in all industrialized countries, except in the United States which has a mix of public and private insurance but with high percentages of uninsured and poorly insured. Health reform is a continuing process as all countries aspire to assure health care for all. Aging populations, increasing costs, advancing and increasing technology all require nations to modify and adapt organization and financing systems of health care, health protection and promotion.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.; Varavikova, Elena A.","journal":"The New Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6905b929be7119be19400a9616cdbcf3f16a13d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170208.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124157668000136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124157668000136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bereidge National Health Service","National Health"],"locations":["Canada","United States"],"keyphrases":["health promotion","National health insurance","health protection","Health reform","financing systems of health care","Abstract Health care systems","national health services of various models","Bereidge National Health Service model","Various universal systems of health coverage","industrialized countries","developing countries","number of countries","principles of national responsibility","comprehensive prepaid medical care","private insurance","social solidarity","universal access","Bismarckian social security model","high percentages of uninsured","mix of public","funding","organization","developed world","United States","continuing process","disease prevention","costs","effective ways","common features","Aging populations","technology","nations","Canada"],"language":"en"},

Corticosteroids are effective in lowering the fever and reversing changes in the chest radiograph but have the caveat of encouraging viral replication. The effectiveness of corticosteroids has only been suggested by uncontrolled observations, and the role of these agents in therapy remains to be established by randomized controlled studies. Both ribavirin and corticosteroids have very significant side effects. The lopinavir/ritonavir combination has been shown to reduce the intubation rate and the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes when used with ribavirin. When patients deteriorate clinically despite treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids, rescue treatment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin may be beneficial. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is a sound treatment for SARS patients with respiratory failure if administered with due precaution in the correct environment. Interferons and other novel agents may hold promise as useful anti-SARS therapies in the future. The experience with traditional Chinese medicine is encouraging, and its use as an adjuvant should be further investigated.","publish_time":"2005-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, S.

Of the total 108 fecal samples examined for Eimeria, 108 (100%) were found infected with 11 species of the parasite. Among the identified species of Eimeria, E. bovis was found to be the predominant etiological agent (76.85%), followed in order by E. canadensis (62.96%), E. zuernii (47.2%), E. ellipsoidalis (26.85%), E. subspherica (25.92%), E. brasiliensis (19.4%), E. auburnensis (18.51%), E. alabamensis (14.81%), E. pellita (11.1%), E. illinoisensis (5.5%) and E. bukidnonensis (2.7%). In most calves multiple infections with three species were present. While, 20.7% of calves showed heavy infection, 50.4 and 24.8% of calves showed weak and moderate infection, respectively. There was no significant difference in the OPG values between the calves of different localities. There was also no significant difference between the prevalence rate of infection in males and females. A total of 16.6% of all faecal samples were found to be diarrheic. A highly significant relationship could be identified between the occurrence of diarrhea and the level of E. bovis and E. zuernii oocysts excretion.

To explore the mechanisms of HSCR, we analyzed the RNA-sequencing data of the expansion and the narrow segments of colon tissues separated from children with HSCR. METHODS: RNA-sequencing of the expansion segments and the narrow segments of colon tissues isolated from children with HSCR was performed. After differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the edgeR package in R, functional and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were carried out using DAVID software. To further screen the key genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were conducted separately using Cytoscape software. RESULTS: A total of 117 DEGs were identified in the expansion segment samples, including 47 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that FOS and DUSP1 were implicated in response to endogenous stimulus. In the PPI network analysis, FOS (degree=20), EGR1 (degree=16), ATF3 (degree=9), NOS1 (degree=8), CCL5 (degree=8), DUSP1 (degree=7), CXCL3 (degree=6), VIP (degree=6), FOSB (degree=5), and NOS2 (degree=4) had higher degrees, which could interact with other genes. In addition, two significant modules (module 1 and module 2) were identified from the PPI network.

The genome replication of PRRSV is required to reproduce, within a few hours of infection, the millions of progeny virions that establish, disseminate, and maintain infection. Replication of the viral RNA genome is a multistep process involving a replication complex that is formed not only from components of viral and cellular origin but also from the viral genomic RNA template; this replication complex is embedded within particular virus-induced membrane vesicles. PRRSV RNA replication is directed by at least 14 replicase proteins that have both common enzymatic activities, including viral RNA polymerase, and also unusual and poorly understood RNA-processing functions.

Several studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of ReoV in wastewaters and natural waters, including surface and ground waters from different geographical areas. Most of these studies have reported higher concentrations of ReoV than any other enteric virus analyzed. They are more commonly isolated in chlorine-disinfected wastewaters than other enteric viruses, and appear to survive longer in water. The ability of ReoV to form large aggregates, even with different types of enteric viruses (e.g., poliovirus) and their ability to undergo mechanisms of gene segment reassortment among different serotypes may also explain their greater stability. Different approaches have been applied for concentration of ReoV from water; however, the recovery efficiency of the filtration methods has not been fully evaluated. Recently, molecular methods for identification of ReoV strains and quantification of virus genome have been developed. Studies have shown that the overall detection sensitivity of ReoV RNA is enhanced through initial replication of infectious virions in cell culture.

However, it is important to determine immunological variations to identify factors influencing the health status of these endangered mammals from an evolutionary, ecological, conservation, and public health point of view. Immunity is highly variable and can be influenced by both internal (e.g. hormone levels, energy demand) and external factors (e.g. pathogens, climate). As bats have some peculiar ecological, energetic, and putative immunological characteristics, they are outstanding study organisms for ecoimmunological studies. We tested if (i) female bats have a higher immunity than males similar to most other mammalian species and (ii) individuals differ according to their energy demand (e.g. reproductive status). To study these questions, we sampled female and male Myotis daubentonii with different reproductive states and estimated their bacterial killing activity, hemolysis/hemagglutination titer, immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, and total and differential white blood cell counts. These methods characterize the cellular and humoral branches of both the adaptive and the innate immune responses of these individuals. Reproductively active males had lower cellular immunity compared to non-reproductive individuals. Pregnant females had increased IgG concentrations while hemolysis was enhanced during lactation. No clear trade-off between immunity and reproduction was found; instead immunity of males and female bats seems to be modulated differently due to varying hormonal and energetic states. Our data suggest that both adaptive and innate immunity as well as individual differences (i.e. sex and reproductive state) need to be considered to get a comprehensive overall picture of immunity in wild mammals.","publish_time":"2018-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruoss, Sara; Becker, Nina I.; Otto, Matthias S.; Czirj\u00E1k, G\u00E1bor \u00C1.; Encarna\u00E7\u00E3o, Jorge A.","journal":"Mamm Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d1d9e25358ef1752bbabf0e63186ecaffc6ffb1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunity of males","innate immunity","Studies of immunity","higher immunity","lower cellular immunity","reproductive status","female bats","comprehensive overall picture of immunity","non-reproductive individuals","different reproductive states","hemolysis","energetic states","energy demand","males similar","health status","active males","external factors","wild mammals","endangered mammals","immunological variations","mammalian species","bat species","ecoimmunological studies","increased IgG concentrations","putative immunological characteristics","outstanding study organisms","innate immune responses","public health point of view","hemagglutination titer","bacterial killing activity","male Myotis daubentonii","immunoglobulin G","differential white blood cell counts","individual differences","conservation","Pregnant females","hormone levels","sex","humoral branches","reproduction","methods","pathogens","climate","varying hormonal","clear trade-off","lactation","questions","data"],"language":"en"},

Some are highly contagious and fatal. Vaccination may not be available and antiviral drugs are not effective enough. Infectious control is important in clinical medicine and in Ophthalmology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as an example, is a highly contagious respiratory disease that has recently been reported in Asia, North America, and Europe. Within a matter of weeks, the outbreak has evolved to become a global health threat and more than 30 countries have been afflicted with a novel Coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV) that is the aetiologic agent of SARS. The primary route of transmission of SARS appears involving close person-to-person contact through droplets. Ophthalmologists may be particularly susceptible to the infection as routine ophthalmic examinations like direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination are usually performed in a setting that has close doctor\u2013patient contact. Being the Ophthalmology Department of the only hospital in the world that has just gone through the largest outbreak of SARS, we would like to share our strategy, measures, and experiences of preventing contracting or spreading of SARS infection as an infection control model.

The indications were bone marrow failure in five cases, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia in five cases. The median follow-up of patients who survived without relapse is 6.9 years (3.1\u201316.8 years). The conditioning regimen consisted of a busulfan\u2013cyclophosphamide combination (n=6) or total body irradiation plus chemotherapy (n=4). Six patients received stem cells from unrelated donors and four from identical siblings. Engraftment was complete in eight patients and unassessable in two patients. These latter two patients died of infections 32 and 36 days after HSCT, with grade IV graft-versus-host disease and multiorgan dysfunction. A third patient died from an acute respiratory distress syndrome 17 months after HSCT with progressive granulocytic sarcoma. One patient had an MDS relapse 4 months after HSCT and died 10 months later. The overall 5-year event-free survival rate is 60\u00B115%.

This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in shunt, low and high ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and computed tomography-measured lung aeration following an increase in PEEP in patients with ARDS. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 12 ARDS patients were subjected to recruitment maneuvers followed by setting PEEP at 5 and then either 15 or 20 cmH(2)O. Lung aeration was measured by computed tomography. Values of pulmonary shunt and low and high V/Q mismatch were calculated by a model-based method from measurements of oxygenation, ventilation, and metabolism taken at different inspired oxygen levels and an arterial blood gas sample. RESULTS: Increasing PEEP resulted in reduced values of pulmonary shunt and the percentage of non-aerated tissue, and an increased percentage of normally aerated tissue (p \u003C 0.05). Changes in shunt and normally aerated tissue were significantly correlated (r = \u2212 0.665, p = 0.018). Three distinct responses to increase in PEEP were observed in values of shunt and V/Q mismatch: a beneficial response in seven patients, where shunt decreased without increasing high V/Q; a detrimental response in four patients where both shunt and high V/Q increased; and a detrimental response in a patient with reduced shunt but increased high V/Q mismatch. Non-aerated tissue decreased with increased PEEP in all patients, and hyperinflated tissue increased only in patients with a detrimental response in shunt and V/Q mismatch. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that improved lung aeration following an increase in PEEP is not always consistent with reduced shunt and V/Q mismatch. Poorly matched redistribution of ventilation and perfusion, between dependent and non-dependent regions of the lung, may explain why patients showed detrimental changes in shunt and V/Q mismatch on increase in PEEP, despite improved aeration.

WD has not been described in beef cattle herds of tropical countries. This study describes the molecular detection of BCoV in a diarrhea outbreak in beef cattle steers (Nellore) raised on pasture in Parana, southern Brazil. During the outbreak, the farm had about 600 fattening steers. Watery and bloody diarrhea unresponsive to systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reveals a morbidity rate of approximately 15 %. The BCoV N gene was identified in 42.9 % (6/14) of the diarrheic fecal samples evaluated by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (SN-PCR) technique. Other enteric microorganisms occasionally identified in adult cattle and evaluated in this study such as bovine groups A, B, and C rotavirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine torovirus, aichivirus B, and Eimeria sp. were not identified in the fecal samples. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first description of the BCoV diagnosis in fecal samples collected in a diarrhea outbreak in adult beef cattle grazing in the grass in a tropical country.","publish_time":"2015-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ribeiro, Juliane; Lorenzetti, Elis; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo","journal":"Trop Anim Health Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c05c70c4d549045138745001af4ee40c59c53efc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088806.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712361/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-015-0975-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WD","BCoV N"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["adult cattle","adult beef cattle","beef cattle steers","Worldwide diarrhea outbreaks","bovine viral diarrhea virus","beef cattle herds of tropical countries","bloody diarrhea unresponsive","bovine torovirus","bovine coronavirus","bovine groups","BCoV diagnosis","diarrheic fecal samples","Seasonal outbreaks of WD","molecular detection of BCoV","study","BCoV N gene","aichivirus B","enteric infection","enteric microorganisms","fattening steers","tropical country","systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy","semi-nested polymerase chain reaction","C rotavirus","SN-PCR","Nellore","pasture","grass","morbidity rate","Parana","description","calves","authors","southern Brazil","technique","Eimeria","farm","dairy cows","Northern hemisphere","Winter dysentery","best knowledge"],"language":"en"},

In the study, 117 complete spike gene sequences of Thai PED virus (PEDV) collected from 2008 to 2015 were clustered along with 95 references of PEDV spike sequences, and analyzed with the US sequences dataset (n = 99). The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Thai PEDV spike sequences were genetically diverse and had been influenced by multiple introduction of exotic strains. Although Thai PEDV have been evolved into 6 subgroups (TH1\u20136), Subgroup TH1 strains with the unique 9 nucleotides (CAA GGG AAT) insertion between 688th\u2013689th position of spike (changing amino acid from N to TREY) insertion has become the dominant subgroup since 2014. Thai PEDV spike gene have higher evolutionary rate compare to that of the US sequences. One contributing factor would be the intra-recombination between subgroups.

The objective of this study was to analyze the immunological and pathological responses after infection with the European subtype 3 strain Lena in comparison to subtype 1 strains Belgium A and Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV). Sixteen pigs were inoculated per strain, and sixteen pigs with PBS. At days 7 and 21 post-inoculation (p.i.), four pigs per group were immunized with an Aujeszky disease vaccine (ADV) to study the immune competence after PRRSV infection. Infection with the Lena strain resulted in fever and clinical signs. This was not observed in the Belgium A or LV-infected pigs. Infection with the Lena strain resulted in high virus titers in serum, low numbers of IFN-\u03B3 secreting cells, a change in leukocyte populations and a delayed antibody response to immunization with ADV. Levels of IL-1\u03B2, IFN-\u03B1, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3 mRNA of the Lena-infected pigs were increased during the first week of infection. For pigs infected with the Belgium A or LV strain, the effects of infection on these parameters were less pronounced, although for the Belgium A-infected pigs, the level of the analyzed cytokines, except for TNF-\u03B1, and leukocyte populations were comparable to the Lena-infected pigs. These results suggest that while the outcome of infection for the three strains was comparable, with mostly clearance of viremia at day 33 p.i, differences in immune responses were observed, perhaps contributing to their virulence.","publish_time":"2013-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weesendorp, Eefke; Morgan, Sophie; Stockhofe-Zurwieden, Norbert; Graaf, Ditta J.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of WUV and KIV in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with respiratory infections in hospitals in South Africa and determine their genotypes. STUDY DESIGN: Specimens from patients with acute respiratory infections from hospitals serving Pretoria were screened for WUV and KIV. Positive specimens were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: WUV was identified in (7%) and KIV in (1%) of mainly pediatric patients. Co-infections were common in WUV- and KIV-infected patients (71% and 66.6%, respectively); 57% of patients with WUV and 33% of patients with KIV were HIV-positive while the HIV prevalence in the respiratory virus patient group screened in this study was 33% WUV and KIV patients presented with moderate to severe lower respiratory tract disease.

The 2013\u20132016 outbreak in Western Africa caused unfathomable morbidity and mortality (over 11,000 deaths), and the second largest outbreak is on-going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first stage of an Ebolavirus infection is entry, culminating in delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. Among enveloped viruses, Ebolaviruses use a complex entry pathway: they bind to attachment factors on cell surfaces, are engulfed by macropinocytosis, and traffic through the endosomal system. En route, the receptor binding subunit of the glycoprotein (GP) is reduced from ~130 to ~19 kDa by cathepsins. This event allows cleaved GP (GP(cl)) to bind to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), its endosomal receptor. The virus then fuses with a late endosomal membrane, but how this occurs remains a subject of debate. An early, but standing, observation is that entry of particles bearing GP(cl) is inhibited by agents that raise endosomal pH or inhibit cysteine proteases, suggesting the need for an additional factor(s). Yet, some have concluded that NPC1 is sufficient to trigger the fusion activity of GP(cl). Here, we re-examined this question using sensitive cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays. We did not observe detectable GP(cl)-mediated fusion with NPC1 or its GP(cl) binding domain at any pH tested, while robust fusion was consistently observed with GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at low pH. Addition of proposed fusion-enhancing factors\u2014cations (Ca(\u002B\u002B) and K(\u002B)), a reducing agent, the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero)Phosphate, and a mixture of cathepsins B and L\u2014did not induce detectable fusion.

To trace the evolution of CaKV strains, a total of 201 fecal samples from rectal swabs of diarrheic dogs, which were obtained from May 2014 to April 2015 in northeast China, were detected by reverse transcription-PCR targeting a partial (504 bp) fragment of the 3D gene. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of the CaKV strains identified in northeast China was conducted based on the partial 3D gene sequence. The results indicated that 36 fecal samples (17.91%, 36/201) were positive for CaKV, in which the co-infection rates of canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus-2 and canine bocavirus were 58.33%, 41.67%, and 11.11%, respectively.

We performed a retrospective study of patients returning from abroad in our travel clinic in Japan. All patients presenting within 6 months of traveling abroad between 2004 and 2014 were included in the present study. A total of 2374 (mean age, 35 years) patients were seen by doctors specializing in treating infectious diseases. Of these, 918 were females and 87 of them lived abroad. Diagnoses and exposure regions were recorded for all patients. The most frequent region visited before attending our clinic was Southeast Asia (n = 1050, 44%), with a median duration for staying abroad of 8 days. The major purposes for overseas travel were tourism (n = 1302, 55%) and business (n = 684, 29%). Of the 2399 individual diagnoses made, the most frequent were diseases of the gastrointestinal system (n = 1083, 45%), skin and soft tissue (n = 440, 18%), systemic febrile disease without specific systems (419, 18%), and the respiratory system (353, 15%). The relative incidences of specific diseases changed drastically due to significant disease outbreaks, such as pandemic influenza in 2009. Exposure regions remained relatively constant throughout the study period, except for Japan. Vaccine-preventable diseases accounted for 5.3% of all the diseases, and 402 (26%) patients received pre-travel consultation and prophylaxis with vaccines and/or anti-malarial drug. We should make an effort to make more people notice the risk of travel and properly perform prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshimura, Yukihiro; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Miyajima, Makiko; Sakamoto, Yohei; Amano, Yuichiro; Tachikawa, Natsuo","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc42a2a4e56107012dd91c3682e43432ad5cee1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128327.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27780680/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2016.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X16301830; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X16301830","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["number of patients","retrospective study of patients","travel clinic","infectious diseases","overseas travel","risk of travel","Vaccine-preventable diseases","relative incidences of specific diseases","pre-travel consultation","prophylaxis","exposure regions","study period","present study","Japan","specific systems","frequent region","gastrointestinal system","individual diagnoses","respiratory system","significant disease outbreaks","systemic febrile disease","vaccines","tourism","major purposes","mean age","years","skin","doctors","pandemic influenza","anti-malarial drug","people","soft tissue","Southeast Asia","total","business","median duration","future","days","effort","months","females"],"language":"en"},

M. pneumoniae is detected in CAP patients most frequently among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age, with a decline after adolescence and tapering off in adulthood. Detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology in children with CAP admitted to the hospital amount 4\u201339%. Although the infection is generally mild and self-limiting, patients of every age can develop severe or extrapulmonary disease. Recent studies indicate that high rates of healthy children carry M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract and that current diagnostic PCR or serology cannot discriminate between M. pneumoniae infection and carriage. Further, symptoms and radiologic features are not specific for M. pneumoniae infection. Thus, patients may be unnecessarily treated with antimicrobials against M. pneumoniae. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics for this entity in children younger than 8 years of age. Overall macrolides are extensively used worldwide, and this has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, which may be associated with severe clinical features and more extrapulmonary complications. This review focuses on the characteristics of M. pneumoniae infections in children, and exemplifies that simple clinical decision rules may help identifying children at high risk for CAP due to M. pneumoniae. This may aid physicians in prescribing appropriate first-line antibiotics, since current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection are not reliably predictive.","publish_time":"2016-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer Sauteur, Patrick M.; Unger, Wendy W.

This review discusses the importance of tear fluid as a source of biomarker for keratoconus and how advances in technology have helped map the complexity of tears and thereby molecular readouts of the disease. Expanding knowledge of the tear proteome, lipidome and metabolome opened up new avenues to study keratoconus and to identify probable prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. A multidimensional approach of analyzing tear fluid of patients layering on proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics is necessary in effectively decoding keratoconus and thereby identifying targets for its treatment.","publish_time":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishtala, Krishnatej; Pahuja, Natasha; Shetty, Rohit; Nuijts, Rudy M.

This commentary has taken up this discussion and the conclusions drawn at this meeting to make a case for the opportunity the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide in highlighting the interconnectedness of factors that are relevant in the successful fight against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and emerging infectious diseases (EIDS). MAIN BODY: Despite NTDs being endemic and EIDS being epidemic, in order to prevent both disease groups effectively, it is important to appreciate that they share essential health determining factors, namely: neglect, poverty, a lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities and an absence of or severely limited provision of healthcare as well as in many cases a zoonotic nature. Instead of looking to \u201Csimple disease management\u201D for the answer, the SDGs help to understand the interplay of multiple priority areas and thereby help to promote a more holistic approach to addressing these two disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: Their commonalities mean that the Global Health community should leverage opportunities and efforts in the prevention and elimination of both NTDs and EIDs. Doing so using a One Health approach is considered to offer a \u201Cpublic health best-buy\u201D. Concrete solutions are proposed.

However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture. Toxins were found throughout the colon. Purified toxins A and B (individually and conjointly) caused comparable lesions, as well as fluid accumulation, in ligated intestinal loops.

OBJECTIVE: To discover the utility of nasal dipsticks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA analysis in differentiating bacterial sinusitis from other causes of chronic cough and identifying pathogens from the nasal cavity. METHOD: We recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3). Based on symptoms, the results of nasal secretion assays, and nasal endoscopy, a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. We identified potential pathogens by quantitative PCR of nasal secretions. RESULTS: Group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 10): Eight (80%) patients had bacterial sinusitis associated with dominant potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB): Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group 1B (cough without clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 12): None had dominant PPB. Group 2 (allergic rhinitis n = 7): None had dominant PPB. Group 3 (asymptomatic n = 10): None had dominant PPB. Twenty to 57% of all groups were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty to 70% were colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum. CONCLUSION: In children with chronic cough, clinicians can utilize a simple and inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay for rapid diagnosis of sinusitis and identify PPB by DNA-PCR test for specific antibiotic treatment.","publish_time":"2019-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Charles; Chorath, Jeena; Pak, Youngju; Redjal, Nasser","journal":"Allergy Rhinol (Providence)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b09fe466052873919115ea1da6510a01704c6c3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6327234.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2152656718821281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":["PPB","Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical bacterial sinusitis n","dominant PPB","diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis","nasal endoscopy","nasal cavity","causes of chronic cough","rapid diagnosis of sinusitis","quantitative PCR of nasal secretions","results of nasal secretion assays","utility of nasal dipsticks","allergic rhinitis n","asymptomatic n","inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay","DNA-PCR test","potential pathogens","children","dominant potential pathogenic bacteria","controls","patients","DNA analysis","Staphylococcus epidermidis","respiratory symptoms","Staphylococcus aureus","polymerase chain reaction","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus influenzae","Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum","clinicians","specific antibiotic treatment","Dolosigranulum pigrum","Moraxella catarrhalis","diagnostic challenge","years of age","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","groups","weeks","OBJECTIVE","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

In a second display format, MSA2 was fused to the peptidoglycan-binding domain (Protein Anchor) of the lactococcal cell wall hydrolase AcmA and was non-covalently rebound to the surface of non-genetically modified, non-living high-binder L. lactis cells, termed Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles. The L. lactis recombinants carrying covalently bound MSA2 were used to immunise rabbits through nasal and oral routes. The highest levels of IgG antibodies reacting with near-native MSA2 on merozoites was elicited by oral administration. Intestinal antibodies to MSA2 were produced only after oral immunisation. MSA2-specific Th-cell activation could be demonstrated.

These two forms elicited similar titres of serum antibodies. The results illustrate the potential of using non-genetically modified L. lactis as a safe vaccine delivery vehicle to elicit systemic antibodies, thereby avoiding the dissemination of recombinant DNA into the environment.","publish_time":"2006-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramasamy, R.; Yasawardena, S.; Zomer, A.; Venema, G.; Kok, J.; Leenhouts, K.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2146a12f6582f67840a82472682d2c7f3fd2259.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115539.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06002106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06002106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bound MSA2","native MSA2","oral immunisations of MSA2","lactis cells","surface of non-","Lactococcus lactis","lactis recombinants","lactis GEM particles","MSA2-specific Th-cell activation","modified producer cells","cell surface","systemic antibodies","Intestinal antibodies","oral routes","oral administration","Protein Anchor","display format","results","similar titres of serum antibodies","highest levels of IgG antibodies","lactococcal cell wall hydrolase AcmA","Gram-positive enhancer matrix","lactococcal proteinase PrtP","putative protective protein","Plasmodium falciparum merozoites","Gram-positive food-grade bacterium","LPXTG-type anchoring motif","safe vaccine delivery vehicle","non-living high-binder","rabbits","peptidoglycan-binding domain","forms","immunogenicity","dissemination of recombinant DNA","different ways","environment","potential"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. RESULTS: Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged; the incubation period was 3\u20137 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3\u201338.0 \u00B0C). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others had ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) were exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir because of adverse effects, two of them deteriorated, one was hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir use. Levels of potassium, albumin, and lymphocytes were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge.

Background Globally, respiratory infections are the primary cause of illness in developing countries, specifically among children; however, an etiological agent for many of these illnesses is rarely identified. Objectives Our study aimed to estimate the frequency of human bocavirus (HBoV) infection among pediatric populations in Argentina, Nicaragua and Peru. Methods We conducted a cross\u2010sectional study using stored samples of an influenza\u2010like illness surveillance program. Irrespective of previous diagnosis, nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens were randomly selected and tested using real\u2010time PCR from three sites during 2007 from patients younger than 6 years old. Results A total of 568 specimens from Argentina (185), Nicaragua (192) and Peru (191) were tested. The prevalence of HBoV was 10\u00B78% (95% CI: 6\u00B73; 15\u00B73) in Argentina, 33\u00B73% in Nicaragua (95% CI: 26\u00B76; 40\u00B71) and 25\u00B71% in Peru (95% CI: 18\u00B79; 31\u00B73).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients \u003C14 years of age who were discharged with a diagnosis of MPP between January 2016 and February 2017. We collected clinical, laboratory and radiographic variables at the time of initial admission. We assessed pneumonia-related readmission within 90-day after discharge. Risk factors independently associated with rehospitalization were identified using multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 424 MPP hospitalizations, 48 (11.3%) were readmitted within 90 days and were mainly diagnosed with pneumonia. Patients with younger age or coinfection with influenza A were more likely to be readmitted. In addition, compared with children without readmission, the readmission ones showed different clinical and laboratory characteristics at the index hospital admission. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age (OR 0.815, 95%CI 0.706\u20130.940) and body temperature (OR 0.659, 95%CI 0.518\u20130.839) were significantly associated with lower risk of 90-day readmission.

Before and after inductive protocol, Dynamic-MRI was employed on bilateral femora for local intra-osseous perfusion, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis and lipid-transportation, and marrow samples were quantified for adipogenesis-gene mRNA expression. Six weeks later, bilateral femora were dissected for Micro-CT-based micro-angiography, and then ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular fat-cell-size were examined histopathologically. RESULTS: The incidence of ON in the PE group (31%) was significantly lower than that in the CON group (93%). Compared to the CON group, local intra-osseous perfusion was maintained in the PE group.

Our manual analysis of the BLASTN results demonstrates that the HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) gene exists in the SARS-CoV, and many mutations made it unfamiliar to us.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Jianfei; Wang, Jing; Xu, Jing; Li, Wei; Han, Yujun; Li, Yan; Ji, Jia; Ye, Jia; Xu, Zhao; Zhang, Zizhang; Wei, Wei; Li, Songgang; Wang, Jun; Wang, Jian; Yu, Jun; Yang, Huanming","journal":"Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b428fa1fc5626bb38ba1efdb48d715b545f262c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5bc13185f8fc98b99cd1fb22078afeda41eb1e7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5172238.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1672022903010271; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022903010271","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complete SARS-CoV genome sequences","complete genome sequences","manual analysis","detailed analysis","Genomic signature analysis","evolution of pathogens","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","diagnosis","biological significance","viruses available","prevention","GenBank","existence","comparative analyses","coronaviruses","gene","richest tetranucleotide","BLASTN results","therapy of infectious diseases","TGTT","distinct genotypes","hemagglutinin-esterase","origin","mutations","isolates","order","Knowledge","groups"],"language":"en"},

Among them, the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its metabolic product angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), and the Mas receptor has been of biological significance since these components form a counterregulatory axis (ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas) that opposes the detrimental actions of Ang II.

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells, and in areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 post-inoculation (dpi), followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia on 7 dpi. Viral antigen was also found in the duodenum epithelial cells with viral RNA detected in feces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to na\u00EFve hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies.

The apelin\u2013APJ receptor pathway has been implicated in HF, making it a promising therapeutic target. APJ has been shown to be activated by a novel endogenous peptide ligand known as Elabela (ELA, also called Toddler or Apela), with a critical role in cardiac development and function. Activation of the ELA\u2013APJ receptor axis exerts a wide range of physiological effects, including depressor response, positive inotropic action, diuresis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-remodeling, leading to its cardiovascular protection. The ELA\u2013APJ axis is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate fluid homeostasis, myocardial contractility, vasodilation, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cardiorenal fibrosis, and dysfunction. The beneficial effects of the ELA\u2013APJ receptor system are well-established by treating hypertension, myocardial infarction, and HF. Additionally, administration of ELA protects human embryonic stem cells against apoptosis and stress-induced cell death and promotes survival and self-renewal in an APJ-independent manner (X receptor) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for HF. Thus, targeting the ELA\u2013APJ axis has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of HF. An increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of ELA will help to develop effective interventions.

It may be caused by allergic sensitization to macromolecules of biologic origin or to chemicals of low molecular weight, as well as by (heavy) exposure to workplace irritants. The pneumoconioses are caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibres in the lungs. They include silicosis, coal workers\u2019 pneumoconioses, asbestosis and other less common pneumoconioses. Chronic beryllium disease is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to beryllium and resembles sarcoidosis. Hard-metal lung disease is caused by sensitivity to cobalt and resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is generally caused by sensitization to aerosolized biological antigens. Several types of infections may be related more or less specifically to work. Chronic obstructive lung disease is mainly caused by cigarette smoking, but exposure to dusts and gases contribute to its incidence.

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Othman, Houcemeddine; Bouslama, Zied; Brandenburg, Jean-Tristan; da Rocha, Jorge; Hamdi, Yosr; Ghedira, Kais; Srairi-Abid, Najet; Hazelhurst, Scott","journal":"Biochem Biophys Res Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fd12ab2487048d959e07e92cc34fcc21eacde0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221370.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410735/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20309360?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20309360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Receptor Binding Domain","RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","viral RBD of SARS","spike protein RBD","host ACE2 protein","interaction surface of ACE2","Protein-protein binding assays","human ACE2","progenitor form of SARS","interface residues","host cell","P499 amino acid residues of SARS","viral spike Receptor Binding Domain","binding energy score","interface segment","cell receptor","outbreak","different variants","complex formation","phylogenetic analysis","structural analysis","spread of COVID","different coronavirus isolates","complex evolutionary process","current virus responsible","result of genetic engineering","affinity","genome","Angiotensin","relevance of Q493","details","valuable source of data","opinion","insight","progressive accumulation of mutations","putative jump","phylogeny","stability","present work","impact","enzyme","publishing","identification"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we isolated RVA strains from NCD clinical samples in order to support RVA disease control in Morocco. This isolation process constitutes a first step toward vaccine development. METHODS: Thirteen fecal samples were obtained from calves with a single episode of neonate calf diarrhea at three different dairies and two samples were collected from field during a severe NCD outbreak. Diagnosis of RVA infection was based on fecal immune-chromatographic rapid test and further evaluated for their hemagglutination (HA) activity. RVA isolation was carried out on MA104 cells after inoculates were treated with different concentrations of trypsin TPCK. All RVA isolates were confirmed by LSI VetMAX\u2122 Triplex Ruminant Rotavirus \u0026 Coronavirus Real-Time PCR kit. G and P typing were determined by direct sequencing of the VP4 and VP7 amplicons. RESULTS: RVA isolation was achieved for nine clinical samples following one or two passages (60 %) and was properly depended on HA activity and trypsin treatment of inoculates. The first sign of CPE detected consisted of increased cell granularity, obscure cell boundaries, cell rounding, and eventual degeneration and detachment of cells. At lower TPCK concentration (3\u201310 \u03BCg/inoculum), no changes at the cellular level were observed, while cells activated with 25\u201330 \u03BCg of trypsin/inoculums, they degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced. Appreciable changes in cell\u2019s morphology were detected with optimal trypsin concentration of 15\u201320 \u03BCg trypsin/inoculums. Data from qRT-PCR confirmed that unsuccessful cultivations have No-Ct, and all nine isolates have Ct values ranged between 12.17 and 24.69. Analysis sequencing revealed that field isolates were of G6 P[5] serotype and isolates from the dairy NCD samples were of G10 P[14] serotype. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Morocco which reports the circulation of G10P[14] in NCD on dairy farms and G6P[5] in the field. Our study constitutes a crucial and a necessary step allowing preventive and veterinary medicine to support RVA disease controls in the country.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ennima, Imane; Sebbar, Ghizlane; Harif, Bachir; Amzazi, Saaid; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Touil, Nadia","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaba1af19b87795dc237a55c0236d89ede3cf46a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4858901.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-016-2065-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27150259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCD","RVA","CPE","G6 P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVA isolates","RVA isolation","RVA strains","\u03BCg of trypsin","\u03BCg trypsin","NCD clinical samples","dairy NCD samples","RVA disease controls","fecal samples","field isolates","trypsin treatment","trypsin cytotoxicity","Diagnosis of RVA infection","optimal trypsin concentration","Morocco","study","different concentrations of trypsin TPCK","severe NCD outbreak","G10 P","P typing","G6 P","serotype","detachment of cells","MA104 cells","isolation process","inoculums","HA activity","increased cell granularity","obscure cell boundaries","lower TPCK concentration","necessary step","qRT-PCR","direct sequencing","different dairies","Analysis sequencing","dairy farms","Appreciable changes","Ct values","Coronavirus Real-Time PCR kit","single episode of neonate calf diarrhea","fecal immune-chromatographic rapid test","Triplex Ruminant Rotavirus","veterinary medicine","order","LSI VetMAX","cell\u2019s morphology","calves","main cause of neonatal","eventual degeneration","VP4","unsuccessful cultivations","rotaviruses","G6P","VP7 amplicons","sign of CPE","hemagglutination","cellular level","BACKGROUND","Group","circulation of G10P","country","vaccine development","Data","knowledge","METHODS","passages","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Although ribavirin is a well-known antiviral drug against a broad range of both DNA and RNA viruses in vitro, its inhibitory effect and mechanism of action on porcine nidovirus replication remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether ribavirin suppresses porcine nidovirus infection. Our results demonstrated that ribavirin treatment dose-dependently inhibited the replication of both nidoviruses. The antiviral activity of ribavirin on porcine nidovirus replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times post-infection. Treatment with ribavirin resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production in a dose-dependent manner. Investigations into the mechanism of action of ribavirin against PRRSV and PEDV revealed that the addition of guanosine to the ribavirin treatment significantly reversed the antiviral effects, suggesting that depletion of the intracellular GTP pool by inhibiting IMP dehydrogenase may be essential for ribavirin activity. Further sequencing analysis showed that the mutation frequency in ribavirin-treated cells was similar to that in untreated cells, indicating that ribavirin did not induce error-prone replication. Taken together, our data indicate that ribavirin might not only be a good therapeutic agent against porcine nidovirus, but also a potential candidate to be evaluated against other human and animal coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Youngnam; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39bc187be65c86c626a6526c972740245ac3229f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114464.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170212004078; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.10.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108045/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170212004078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ribavirin activity","ribavirin treatment dose","antiviral activity of ribavirin","porcine nidovirus replication","ribavirin-treated cells","porcine nidoviruses","porcine nidovirus infection","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","PRRSV","PEDV","mechanism of action","antiviral effects","error-prone replication","viral protein expression","emerging viral pathogens","progeny virus production","respiratory syndrome virus","well-known antiviral drug","marked reduction of viral genomic","RNA viruses","untreated cells","subgenomic RNA synthesis","dose-dependent manner","early times post-infection","heavy economic impacts","broad range","IMP dehydrogenase","mutation frequency","inhibitory effect","intracellular GTP pool","depletion","addition of guanosine","good therapeutic agent","swine industry","DNA","sequencing analysis","potential candidate","results","animal coronaviruses","Investigations","present study","data"],"language":"en"},

The potential for communicable disease outbreaks on vessels and the transmission by ship between countries is high. Barbados has one of the busiest ports in the Caribbean. Our aim was to describe and analyse the epidemiology of illnesses experienced by passengers and crew arriving at the Bridgetown Port, Barbados between 2009 and 2013. METHODS: Data on the illnesses recorded were extracted from the passenger and crew arrival registers and passenger and crew illness logs for all ships and maritime vessels arriving at Barbados\u2019 Ports and passing through its territorial waters between January 2009 and December 2013. Data were entered into an Epi Info database and most of the analysis undertaken using Epi Info Version 7. Rates per 100,000 visits were calculated, and confidence intervals on these were derived using the software Openepi. RESULTS: There were 1031 cases of illness from over 3 million passenger visits and 1 million crew visits during this period. The overall event rate for communicable illnesses was 15.7 (95 % CI 14.4\u201317.1) per 100,000 passengers, and for crew was 24.0 (21.6\u201326.6) per 100, 000 crew. Gastroenteritis was the predominant illness experienced by passengers and crew followed by influenza. The event rate for gastroenteritis among passengers was 13.7 (12.5\u201315.0) per 100,000 and 14.4 (12.6, 16.5) for crew. The event rate for non-communicable illnesses was 3.4 per 100,000 passengers with myocardial infarction being the main diagnosis. The event rate for non-communicable illnesses among crew was 2.1 per 100,000, the leading cause being injuries. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant illnesses reported were gastroenteritis and influenza similar to previous published reports from around the world. This study is the first of its type in the Caribbean and the data provide a baseline for future surveillance and for comparison with other countries and regions.","publish_time":"2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marshall, Cathy Ann; Morris, Euclid; Unwin, Nigel","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24fc42faaa7cf3f1b483806e77056a1d253715c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4828867.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27067392/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-2991-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Caribbean","Barbados"],"keyphrases":["crew illness","crew visits","passengers","non-communicable illnesses","predominant illnesses","crew arrival registers","epidemiology of illnesses","passenger visits","overall event rate","Gastroenteritis","Caribbean","Barbados","communicable disease outbreaks","world","cases of illness","countries","Epi Info database","Epi Info Version","maritime vessels","influenza similar","busiest ports","largest cruise ship industries","transmission","previous published reports","comparison","analysis","baseline","ships","future surveillance","myocardial infarction","potential","main diagnosis","Bridgetown Port","type","leading cause","injuries","visitors","year","territorial waters","regions","confidence intervals","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","period","software Openepi","RESULTS","study","BACKGROUND","Rates","CI","aim"],"language":"en"},

Pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS are thought to result from proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients with SARS, but whether cytokines can injure renal tubules is unknown. Methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with SARS in Taiwan in April 2003 were studied. Patients were identified as hypouricemic when their serum uric acid (UA) level was less than 2.5 mg/dL (\u003C149 \u03BCmol/L) within 15 days after fever onset. Urine UA and creatinine levels were available for 43 patients; the serum cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) were measured in 16 patients. Results: Sixteen patients (26.7%) had hypouricemia (UA, 1.68 \u00B1 0.52 mg/dL [100 \u00B1 31 \u03BCmol/L]). No differences in age, sex, symptoms, vital signs, hemogram, or other biochemistry data existed between the hypouricemic and normouricemic groups. Fractional excretion (FE) of UA (FEUA) in 12 hypouricemic patients was 39.6% \u00B1 23.4%, significantly greater than that of 31 normouricemic patients (16.4% \u00B1 11.4%; P \u003C 0.0001). After adjustments for age and sex, high FEUA was significantly associated with the lowest blood oxygenation (P = 0.001; r = \u22120.624). The number of catastrophic outcomes (endotracheal intubation and/or death) adjusted for older age and sex showed that hypouremic patients had an odds ratio of 10.57 (confidence interval, 2.33 to 47.98; P = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier curves for catastrophic outcome\u2013free results showed significant differences between patients with normouricemia or hypouricemia (P = 0.01). Serum IL-8 levels correlated significantly with FEUA (P \u003C 0.001; r = 0.785) and inversely with serum UA level (P = 0.044; r = \u22120.509); neither IL-6 nor TNF-\u03B1 level showed such correlations.

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are the most abundant class of white blood cells, and typically the first type of leukocyte recruited to sites of inflammation. In the CNS, astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell population and participate in the local innate immune response triggered by a variety of insults. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of astrocytes on PMN function. METHODS: Primary astrocyte cultures were derived from postnatal C57BL/6 mice and primary neutrophils were isolated from 8 to 12 weeks old C57BL/6 mice. PMNs respiratory burst was analyzed by H2DCFDA assay. For phagocytosis assay, neutrophils were incubated with FITC-labeled E. coli and the phagocytosis of E coli was determined by flow cytometer. PMNs degranulation was determined by myeloperoxidase assay. Cytokine expression was determined by real-time PCR. To determine the involvement of different signaling pathway, protein lysates were prepared and western blots were conducted to assess the activation of Akt, Erk1/2, and p38. RESULTS: Using ex vivo neutrophils and primary astrocyte cultures, our study demonstrated that astrocytes differentially regulate neutrophil functions, depending upon whether the interactions between the two cell types are direct or indirect. Upon direct cell-cell contact, astrocytes attenuate neutrophil apoptosis, respiratory bust, and degranulation, while enhancing neutrophil phagocytic capability and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Through indirect interaction with neutrophils, astrocytes attenuate apoptosis and enhance necrosis in neutrophils, augment neutrophil phagocytosis and respiratory burst, and inhibit neutrophil degranulation. In addition, astrocytes could augment Akt, Erk1/2, and p38 activation in neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: Astrocytes differentially regulate neutrophil functions through direct or indirect interactions between the two cell types. The diversified actions of astrocytes on neutrophils might provide protection against potential microbial infections given compromised blood-brain barrier integrity under certain neuropathological conditions. The complex actions of astrocytes on neutrophils could provide further insight to harness the inflammatory response to promote CNS repair.","publish_time":"2010-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Luokun; Poteet, Ethan C; Li, Wenjun; Scott, Amanda E; Liu, Ran; Wen, Yi; Ghorpade, Anuja; Simpkins, James W; Yang, Shao-Hua","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d14fd3be698da4aa12b91523c9d099f76775604.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2942816.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-7-53; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20828397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["CNS","PMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary neutrophils","impacts of astrocytes","Polymorphonuclear neutrophils","neutrophil degranulation","neutrophil phagocytosis","complex actions of astrocytes","neutrophil apoptosis","neutrophil functions","diversified actions of astrocytes","direct cell-cell contact","cell types","phagocytosis assay","neutrophil phagocytic capability","indirect interactions","PMNs degranulation","Primary astrocyte cultures","PMNs respiratory burst","abundant glial cell population","immune system","respiratory bust","inflammatory response","phagocytosis of E coli","mice","Erk1","H2DCFDA assay","myeloperoxidase assay","CNS repair","activation of Akt","p38 activation","pro-inflammatory cytokine expression","abundant class of white blood cells","local innate immune response","postnatal C57BL","complex process","PMN function","present study","central nerve system","weeks old C57BL","compromised blood-brain barrier integrity","potential microbial infections","protection","protein lysates","certain neuropathological conditions","necrosis","pathway","Neuroinflammation","insight","involvement of different","western blots","type of leukocyte","flow cytometer","BACKGROUND","variety of insults","real-time PCR","METHODS","FITC","CONCLUSIONS","sites of inflammation","RESULTS","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting. RESULTS: PEDV RNA was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (INF) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Virus shedding in INF pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral RNA levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. Sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (LB) became PEDV positive after the first movement of study personnel from the INF group. However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel. In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs.","publish_time":"2017-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yonghyan; Yang, My; Goyal, Sagar M.; Cheeran, Maxim C-J.; Torremorell, Montserrat","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1fd1fafa75ee05827d3e7e916a03ddf159317ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382501.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1017-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV RNA","INF","PEDV","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high biosecurity","medium biosecurity","INF pigs","MB personnel","PEDV RNA","transmission of virus","dpm","indirect PEDV transmission","risk of PEDV transmission","effectiveness of biosecurity procedures","HB study personnel","movement of study personnel","sentinel pigs","PEDV positive","groups of pigs","farm personnel","low biosecurity group","effectiveness of biosecurity methods","different biosecurity protocols","rectal swabs","face swabs","contaminated PPE","INF group","swabs of fomite","transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","changing PPE","days post movement","viral RNA levels","RESULTS","contaminated fomites","day post infection","consecutive days of movements","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","shower","rRT-PCR","hair","exposed skin areas","controlled experimental setting","personal protective equipment","pig production systems","effective option","BACKGROUND","modeled conditions","CONCLUSIONS","trial","addition"],"language":"en"},

A longitudinal modeling analysis of birth cohorts born 10 years apart","doi":"10.1186/s12916-019-1259-z","pmcid":"PMC6357399","pubmed_id":"30704529","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: China has transitioned from being one of the fastest-growing populations to among the most rapidly aging countries worldwide. In particular, the population of oldest-old individuals, those aged 80\u002B, is projected to quadruple by 2050. The oldest-old represent a uniquely important group\u2014they have high demand for personal assistance and the highest healthcare costs of any age group. Understanding trends in disability and longevity among the oldest-old\u2014that is, whether successive generations are living longer and with less disability\u2014is of great importance for policy and planning purposes. METHODS: We utilized data from successive birth cohorts (n = 20,520) of the Chinese oldest-old born 10 years apart (the earlier cohort was interviewed in 1998 and the later cohort in 2008). Disability was defined as needing personal assistance in performing one or more of five essential activities (bathing, transferring, dressing, eating, and toileting) or being incontinent. Participants were followed for age-specific disability transitions and mortality (in 2000 and 2002 for the earlier cohort and 2011 and 2014 for the later cohort), which were then used to generate microsimulation-based multistate life tables to estimate partial life expectancy (LE) and disability-free LE (DFLE), stratified by sex and age groups (octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians). We additionally explored sociodemographic heterogeneity in LE and DFLE by urban/rural residence and educational attainment. RESULTS: More recently born Chinese octogenarians (born 1919\u20131928) had a longer partial LE between ages 80 and 89 than octogenarians born 1909\u20131918, and octogenarian women experienced an increase in partial DFLE of 0.32 years (P = 0.004) across the two birth cohorts. Although no increases in partial LE were observed among nonagenarians or centenarians, partial DFLE increased across birth cohorts, with a gain of 0.41 years (P \u003C 0.001) among nonagenarians and 0.07 years (P = 0.050) among centenarians. Subgroup analyses revealed that gains in partial LE and DFLE primarily occurred among the urban resident population. CONCLUSIONS: Successive generations of China\u2019s oldest-old are living with less disability as a whole, and LE is expanding among octogenarians. However, we found a widening urban-rural disparity in longevity and disability, highlighting the need to improve policies to alleviate health inequality throughout the population.

METHODS The univariable and multivariable analysis were computed to identify the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. The prediction model was established in a retrospective training set of 322 COVID-19 patients and was re-evaluated in a prospective validation set of 317 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS The multivariable analysis identified age (OR = 1.061, p = 0.028), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR = 1.006, p = 0.037), and CD4 count (OR = 0.993, p = 0.006) as the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. Consequently, the age-LDH-CD4 algorithm was derived as (age \u00D7 LDH)/CD4 count. In the training set, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively). In the prospective validation set, the AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was also significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.75, 0.81, and 0.82, respectively). The age-LDH-CD4 \u2265 82 has high sensitive (81%) and specific (93%) for the early identification of COVID-19 patients with severe progression tendency.

CAP is a common and potentially serious illness, particularly in elderly patients and those with significant comorbidities. CAP may be caused by myriad pathogens, but bacteria are the most common causes. Bacteria have traditionally been divided into two groups: typical and atypical agents. Typical organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes, and aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

Transcription factors play important roles in the disordered gene expression and liver injury caused by HBV. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this observation have not been defined. RESULTS: In this study, we observed that circulating prostaglandin (PGE) 2 synthesis was increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, and detected elevated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in HBV- and HBx-expressing liver cells. Likewise, the association of HBx with C/EBP\u03B2 contributed to the induction of COX-2. The COX-2 promoter was hypomethylated in HBV-positive cells, and specific demethylation of CpG dinucleotides within each of the two NF-AT sites in the COX-2 promoter resulted in the increased binding affinity of NF-AT to the cognate sites in the promoter, followed by increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 accumulation. The DNA methylatransferase DNMT3B played a key role in the methylation of the COX-2 promoter, and its decreased binding to the promoter was responsible for the regional demethylation of CpG sites, and for the increased binding of transcription factors in HBV-positive cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that upregulation of COX-2 by HBV and HBx is mediated by both demethylation events and recruitment of multiple transcription factors binding to the promoter.","publish_time":"2011-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yue, Xin; Yang, Fang; Yang, Yongbo; Mu, Yongxin; Sun, Wei; Li, Wei; Xu, Dongping; Wu, Jianguo; Zhu, Ying","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1968f8d8ffe3f695372d919c9966b1ca412b83d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3066118.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21401943/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV","CpG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["promoter","increased COX","upregulation of COX","induction of COX","HBV-positive cells","increased binding of transcription factors","liver cells","increased binding affinity of NF","decreased binding","regional demethylation of CpG sites","demethylation events","recruitment of multiple transcription factors","liver injury","association of HBx","cognate sites","RESULTS","specific demethylation of CpG dinucleotides","disordered gene expression","hepatitis B virus","chronic hepatitis B infection","damage","important roles","key role","major etiological factor of inflammation","patients","EBP\u03B2","elevated cyclooxygenase","synthesis","DNA methylatransferase DNMT3B","PGE2 accumulation","prostaglandin","BACKGROUND","hepatocellular carcinoma","molecular mechanisms","observation","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring. This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manto, Mario; Dupre, Nicolas; Hadjivassiliou, Marios; Louis, Elan D.; Mitoma, Hiroshi; Molinari, Marco; Shaikh, Aasef G.; Soong, Bing-Wen; Strupp, Michael; Van Overwalle, Frank; Schmahmann, Jeremy D.","journal":"Cerebellum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed7b32f74c085f87817643d0a42a7831ce6c6881.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410881/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-020-01139-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cerebellum Task Force"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["well-being of CA patients","care of patients","CA patient care","CA patient population","Older patients","community of ataxia patients","greater risk","acute crisis","non-COVID","neurological manifestations of COVID","higher risk","high risk","coronavirus disease","cerebellar ataxia","caregiver-patient contact","immunosuppressive medication","global pandemic","neurological complexities","immunosuppressive agents","medical systems","greater attention","cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges","physical health","genetic ataxias","physical distancing","cerebellar neurobiology","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","comorbid medical illnesses","immune-mediated ataxias","Cerebellum Task Force consensus","healthcare delivery","response","underlying disorder","language therapy","face-to-face consultations","speech","interruption of rehabilitation","SARS-CoV","families","course","conditions","disruption of social patterns","negative impact","defense","long-term consequences","academic neurologists","guidance","serious complications","principle","ataxiologists","prevailing uncertainty","anxiety","new realities","infection","brink of collapse","cytokine storm","close surveillance","monitoring","telemedicine","isolation","implications","uncertain time","recognition","review"],"language":"en"},

This paper intends to review the developments in water quality monitoring technologies for the detection of biological and chemical contaminants in accordance with instrumental limitations. Particularly, this review focuses on the most recently developed techniques for water contaminant detection applications. Several recommendations and prospective views on the developments in water quality assessments will also be included.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zulkifli, Syahidah Nurani; Rahim, Herlina Abdul; Lau, Woei-Jye","journal":"Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dc23a08413da1f0a41e173128b0ceae440e921d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126548.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288249/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400517317446; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400517317446","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["water contaminant detection applications","water monitoring applications","detection of contaminant","detection of biological","detection sensitivities","efficient techniques of contaminants detection","water quality monitoring technologies","water quality assessments","Abstract Water monitoring technologies","water treatment plant","water distribution system","multiple detection analyses","wide variety of water ecology applications","developed techniques","spectroscopic techniques","various advanced techniques","chemical contaminants","Recent developments","review","successful establishment","hand-held sensing devices","heavy metal ions","biosensor approach","pesticides","portability","microorganisms","minimum operating cost","real-time basis","accordance","situ measurements","organic components","prospective views","past decades","instrumental limitations","energy","recommendations","research","availability"],"language":"en"},

In addition, due to the long incubation period for most foodborne parasites, source attribution is often difficult, if not impossible. However, global trends have enabled foodborne parasites to emerge in different populations in new locations, transmitted through different food types, and sometimes with unexpected symptoms. This emergence of foodborne parasites has brought them into focus. In this chapter, six foodborne parasites are used as examples on emergence: Echinococcus multilocularis is spreading to new locations; Cryptosporidium spp. are beginning to be associated not only with water, but also with salads; Trypanosoma cruzi is being manifest with acute disease due to foodborne transmission, particularly transmitted with juices; Trichinella spp. have become less of a burden regarding transmission via pork in many countries, but now game animals are becoming a concern; anisakiasis is becoming a global problem as the world develops a taste for sushi, and similarly for opisthorchiasis, which is increasingly being associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, the emergence of these foodborne parasites provides an incentive for increased efforts being made toward control. In this chapter, having described how the parasites are emerging from their neglected position, the focus turns toward control. In addition to considering control measures that may be applied to the specific parasites, an overview is provided of some of the organized collaborations, projects, and consortia, as well as some of their outputs, that have in focus the control of these emerging and important pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robertson, Lucy J.","journal":"Advances in Food and Nutrition Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e75870ef85919552d2dca5250431d4efe21fe7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129657.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043452618300408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30077225/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.afnr.2018.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043452618300408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of foodborne parasites","Abstract Foodborne parasites","specific parasites","foodborne transmission","focus","control measures","new locations","different populations","addition","chapter","neglected group of pathogens","global problem","neglected position","acute diseases","global trends","important pathogens","marginalized populations","different food types","long incubation period","Echinococcus multilocularis","examples","source attribution","increased efforts","countries","world","concern","anisakiasis","incentive","game animals","chronic effects","Trypanosoma cruzi","sushi","salads","organized collaborations","projects","consortia","taste","pork","juices","unexpected symptoms","burden","Cryptosporidium","overview","opisthorchiasis","water","Trichinella","cholangiocarcinoma","outputs"],"language":"en"},

Abstract In the Fall of 2002 a report from Guangdong Province in China showed the occurrence of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia. This outbreak rapidly progressed from China to Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, and the USA, to more than 25 countries worldwide and almost 3500 cases to date in april 2003. The clinical features associate a fever with mild respiratory symptoms which can progress to a typical acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care unit admission. Enteric forms with diarrhea were recently described in Hong Kong. The medical community responded very rapidly and united in front of this major health crisis.

The disease can spell disaster not only through its infection but also by break of immunity in chickens vaccinated for other diseases. l-Arginine, a ubiquitous, semi-essential amino acid has emerged as an imunostimulant from variety of human and animal studies. In the present study, we demonstrate the stimulatory effects of l-arginine on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (iIELs) functions as well as on systemic immune response in chickens orally vaccinated with live intermediate plus (IP) strain of IBD vaccine. Challenge studies with virulent IBDV revealed complete (100%) protection in IP\u002B l-arginine group compared with 80% protection recorded in IP strain vaccinated chickens. Functional activities of iIELs evaluated by cytotoxicity assay demonstrated significantly high percentage cytotoxicity in IP\u002B l-arginine groups compared with IP group (P \u003C0.05). Proliferative response of iIELs against IBDV antigen and Con-A was also significantly higher in IP\u002B l-arginine group. Similar results were obtained with peripheral blood mononuclear cell blastogenic response to IBDV and Con-A analyzed as an indicator of systemic cell-mediated immune response. Orally administered IP strain vaccine elicited good antibody titres in both the groups, IP and IP\u002B l-arginine, however, the antibody titres were significantly higher in IP\u002B l-arginine group compared with IP vaccinated group (P \u003C0.05).

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is another high prevalent pathogen in swine in many regions of the world. PCV2 and HEV are both highly prevalent in pig farms in China. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we characterized the HEV and PCV2 co-infection in 2\u20133 month-old piglets, based on pathogen identification and the pathological changes observed, in Hebei Province, China. The pathological changes were severe, and general hyperemia, hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis were evident in the tissues of dead swine. PCR was used to identify the pathogen and we tested for eight viruses (HEV, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, PCV2, Classical swine fever virus, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, Porcine parvovirus and Pseudorabies virus) that are prevalent in Chinese pig farms. The livers, kidneys, spleens, and other organs of the necropsied swine were positive for HEV and/or PCV2. Immunohistochemical staining showed HEV- and PCV2-antigen-positive signals in the livers, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, and intestine. CONCLUSION: HEV and PCV2 co-infection in piglets was detected in four out of seven dead pigs from two pig farms in Hebei, China, producing severe pathological changes. The natural co-infection of HEV and PCV2 in pigs in China has rarely been reported. We speculate that co-infection with PCV2 and HEV may bring some negative effect on pig production and recommend that more attention should be paid to this phenomenon.","publish_time":"2015-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yifei; Shi, Ruihan; She, Ruiping; Mao, Jingjing; Zhao, Yue; Du, Fang; Liu, Can; Liu, Jianchai; Cheng, Minheng; Zhu, Rining; Li, Wei; Wang, Xiaoyang; Soomro, Majid Hussain","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1a107788ce585f3f5a7daa6b2eaf55997935192.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4379595.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0375-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PCV2 co-infection","PCV2-antigen","natural co-infection of HEV","China","Pseudorabies virus","Classical swine fever virus","necropsied swine","swine industry","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","respiratory syndrome virus","tissues of dead swine","severe pathological changes","Chinese pig farms","Porcine parvovirus","Porcine circovirus","pig production","Hepatitis E virus","high prevalent pathogen","kidneys","pathogen identification","livers","dead pigs","positive signals","Hebei Province","month-old piglets","Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","general hyperemia","inflammatory cell infiltration","hemorrhage","necrosis","lungs","organs","lymph nodes","recent decades","negative effect","causative agent of postweaning multisystemic","regions","viruses","CONCLUSION","intestine","attention","BACKGROUND","spleens","study","threat","Immunohistochemical staining","CASE PRESENTATION","world","phenomenon","PCR"],"language":"en"},

This assay was conducted at 60\u00B0C for 40min. Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was confirmed using several equine intestinal and respiratory pathogens in addition to ECoV. The novel assay failed to cross-react with the other pathogens tested, suggesting it is highly specific for ECoV. Using artificially synthesized ECoV RNA, the 50% detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 101.8 copies/reaction. This is a 50-fold greater sensitivity than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, but a 4-fold lower sensitivity than quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Eighty-two fecal samples collected during ECoV outbreaks were analyzed. ECoV was detected in 59 samples using the RT-LAMP assay, and in 30 and 65 samples using RT-PCR or qRT-PCR assays, respectively. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than qRT-PCR techniques, it can be performed without the need for expensive equipment. Thus, the RT-LAMP assay might be suitable for large-scale surveillance and diagnosis of ECoV infection in laboratories with limited resources.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nemoto, Manabu; Morita, Yoshinori; Niwa, Hidekazu; Bannai, Hiroshi; Tsujimura, Koji; Yamanaka, Takashi; Kondo, Takashi","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99275845d959ba4b62af6b3dc2a83ee6f57e762d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25682750/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415000233; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415000233","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP assay","quantitative RT-PCR","novel assay","qRT-PCR assays","ECoV outbreaks","qRT-PCR techniques","diagnosis of ECoV infection","synthesized ECoV RNA","fecal samples","reverse transcription loop","conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","greater sensitivity","detection limit","rapid detection of equine coronavirus","lower sensitivity","respiratory pathogens","large-scale surveillance","isothermal amplification","laboratories","addition","limited resources","copies","Specificity","need","expensive equipment"],"language":"en"},

We identified two novel picornaviruses, rosavirus B from the street rat, Norway rat, and rosavirus C from five different wild rat species (chestnut spiny rat, greater bandicoot rat, Indochinese forest rat, roof rat and Coxing\u0027s white-bellied rat) in China. Analysis of 13 complete genome sequences showed that \u201CRosavirus B\u201D and \u201CRosavirus C\u201D represent two potentially novel picornavirus species infecting different rodents. Though being most closely related to rosavirus A, rosavirus B and C possessed distinct protease cleavage sites and variations in Yn-Xm-AUG sequence in 5\u2019UTR and myristylation site in VP4. Anti-rosavirus B VP1 antibodies were detected in Norway rats, whereas anti-rosavirus C VP1 and neutralizing antibodies were detected in Indochinese forest rats and Coxing\u0027s white-bellied rats. While the highest prevalence was observed in Coxing\u0027s white-bellied rats by RT-PCR, the detection of rosavirus C from different rat species suggests potential interspecies transmission. Rosavirus C isolated from 3T3 cells causes multisystemic diseases in a mouse model, with high viral loads and positive viral antigen expression in organs of infected mice after oral or intracerebral inoculation. Histological examination revealed alveolar fluid exudation, interstitial infiltration, alveolar fluid exudate and wall thickening in lungs, and hepatocyte degeneration and lymphocytic/monocytic inflammatory infiltrates with giant cell formation in liver sections of sacrificed mice. Since rosavirus A2 has been detected in fecal samples of children, further studies should elucidate the pathogenicity and emergence potential of different rosaviruses.","publish_time":"2016-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K.

In late April 2009, a potentially pandemic novel H1N1 influenza strain (nH1N1) was recognized. New York City (NYC) experienced an intensive initial outbreak that peaked in late May, providing the need and opportunity to rapidly quantify the severity of nH1N1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Telephone surveys using rapid polling methods of approximately 1,000 households each were conducted May 20\u201327 and June 15\u201319, 2009. Respondents were asked about the occurrence of influenza-like illness (ILI, fever with either cough or sore throat) for each household member from May 1\u201327 (survey 1) or the preceding 30 days (survey 2). For the overlap period, prevalence data were combined by weighting the survey-specific contribution based on a Serfling model using data from the NYC syndromic surveillance system. Total and age-specific prevalence of ILI attributed to nH1N1 were estimated using two approaches to adjust for background ILI: discounting by ILI prevalence in less affected NYC boroughs and by ILI measured in syndromic surveillance data from 2004\u20132008. Deaths, hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were determined from enhanced surveillance including nH1N1-specific testing. Combined ILI prevalence for the 50-day period was 15.8% (95% CI:13.2%\u201319.0%). The two methods of adjustment yielded point estimates of nH1N1-associated ILI of 7.8% and 12.2%. Overall case-fatality (CFR) estimates ranged from 0.054\u20130.086 per 1000 persons with nH1N1-associated ILI and were highest for persons \u226565 years (0.094\u20130.147 per 1000) and lowest for those 0\u201317 (0.008\u20130.012). Hospitalization rates ranged from 0.84\u20131.34 and ICU admission rates from 0.21\u20130.34 per 1000, with little variation in either by age-group. CONCLUSIONS: ILI prevalence can be quickly estimated using rapid telephone surveys, using syndromic surveillance data to determine expected \u201Cbackground\u201D ILI proportion. Risk of severe illness due to nH1N1 was similar to seasonal influenza, enabling NYC to emphasize preventing severe morbidity rather than employing aggressive community mitigation measures.","publish_time":"2010-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hadler, James L.; Konty, Kevin; McVeigh, Katharine H.; Fine, Anne; Eisenhower, Donna; Kerker, Bonnie; Thorpe, Lorna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63163ea587b9a59590ba18cc55a6ae435fee7919.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2908148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20657738/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011677","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["background ILI","nH1N1-associated ILI","Combined ILI prevalence","ILI proportion","age-specific prevalence of ILI","prevalence data","severity of nH1N1","syndromic surveillance data","nH1N1-specific testing","pandemic influenza","point estimates of nH1N1","NYC syndromic surveillance system","enhanced surveillance","seasonal influenza","occurrence of influenza","survey-specific contribution","affected NYC boroughs","rapid telephone surveys","pandemic novel H1N1 influenza strain","rapid polling methods","pandemic strain\u0027s severity","methods of adjustment","persons","Risk of severe illness","ICU admission rates","severe morbidity","age-group","overlap period","day period","Hospitalization rates","intensive care unit","intensive initial outbreak","admissions","public health response","Serfling model","sore throat","hospitalizations","fever","FINDINGS","discounting","aggressive community mitigation measures","CFR","Deaths","cough","Overall case-fatality","New York City","household member","households","approaches","little variation","need","opportunity","years","days","CONCLUSIONS","Respondents"],"language":"en"},

Urbanization carries potential health benefits due to improved access to an increased variety of food imports, although for the growing number of urban poor, this has often meant increased reliance on cheap, highly processed food commodities. Reduced barriers to trade have eased the importation of such commodities, while investment liberalization has increased corporate consolidation over global and domestic food chains.

In the process, they can pause the elongating ribosome for regulation. An example is the stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to 3\u2032 direction slippage of the reading-frame during elongation, by specific pseudoknot stimulators downstream of the frameshifting site. By investigating a recently identified regulatory element upstream of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) \u22121 frameshifting site, it is shown that a minimal functional element with hairpin forming potential is sufficient to down-regulate\u22121 frameshifting activity. Mutagenesis to disrupt or restore base pairs in the potential hairpin stem reveals that base-pair formation is required for\u22121 frameshifting attenuation in vitro and in 293T cells. The attenuation efficiency of a hairpin is determined by its stability and proximity to the frameshifting site; however, it is insensitive to E site sequence variation. Additionally, using a dual luciferase assay, it can be shown that a hairpin stimulated \u002B1 frameshifting when placed upstream of a \u002B1 shifty site in yeast. The investigations indicate that the hairpin is indeed a cis-acting programmed reading-frame switch modulator. This result provides insight into mechanisms governing\u22121 frameshifting stimulation and attenuation. Since the upstream hairpin is unwound (by a marching ribosome) before the downstream stimulator, this study\u2019s findings suggest a new mode of translational regulation that is mediated by the reformed stem of a ribosomal unwound RNA hairpin during elongation.","publish_time":"2013-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Che-Pei; Lin, Szu-Chieh; Chou, Ming-Yuan; Hsu, Hsiu-Ting; Chang, Kung-Yao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90a7c8a2e1be47616b2f04bd011c148fcbc8adba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3639245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23638024/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshifting site","frameshifting attenuation","frameshifting stimulation","upstream hairpin","frameshifting activity","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","potential hairpin stem","ribosomal unwound RNA hairpin","shifty site","elongation","E site sequence variation","attenuation efficiency","programmed reading-frame switch modulator","reformed stem","base pairs","SARS coronavirus","SARS-CoV","regulatory element","downstream stimulator","RNA structures","marching ribosome","elongating ribosome","base-pair formation","minimal functional element","new mode of translational regulation","study\u2019s findings","specific pseudoknot stimulators","mechanisms","stability","direction slippage","insight","proximity","T cells","dual luciferase assay","result","decoding","Mutagenesis","yeast","process","example","investigations"],"language":"en"},

Q-UEL tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bioinformatics tools were again used for efficiency, but the focus in this paper is even more on the virus. Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV of the S2\u2032 spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage site continues to appear important. Here it is shown to be recognizable in the common cold coronaviruses, avian coronaviruses and possibly as traces in the nidoviruses of reptiles and fish. Its function or functions thus seem important to the coronaviruses. It might represent SARS-CoV-2 Achilles\u2019 Heel, less likely to acquire resistance by mutation, as has happened in some early SARS vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper. Preliminary conformational analysis of the receptor (ACE2) binding site of the spike protein is carried suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved, it appears to be more variable than KRSFIEDLLFNKV. However compounds like emodin that inhibit SARS entry, apparently by binding ACE2, might also have functions at several different human protein binding studies. The enzyme 11\u03B2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model pharmacophore perhaps representing an ensemble of targets, and it is noted that it occurs both in lung and alimentary tract. Perhaps it benefits the virus to block an inflammatory response by inhibiting the dehydrogenase, but a fairly complex web involves several possible targets.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robson, B.","journal":"Comput Biol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdb2dd6fb08f6eabab8f0952da9fe43de101c00e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151553.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482520301281?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482520301281; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103749","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","binding site","binding ACE2","SARS entry","spike protein sequence","different human protein binding studies","functions","avian coronaviruses","early SARS vaccine studies","COVID","previous paper","common cold coronaviruses","spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage site","bioinformatics tools","ensemble of targets","possible targets","Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV","Q-UEL tools","\u03B2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type","S2","relevant computational techniques","access","receptor","viral threats","knowledge","recent study","Achilles\u2019 Heel","introductory review","enzyme","traces","complex web","Preliminary conformational analysis","convenient model pharmacophore","nidoviruses of reptiles","resistance","efficiency","compounds","emodin","inflammatory response","lung","alimentary tract","fish","mutation","focus","example"],"language":"en"},

However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains unclear. In this study, we established a pig model for CSFV infection and found that viral loads of CSFV differed in 10 kinds of infected organs, and that the degree of tissue lesions was to some extent positively correlated with CSFV replication in vivo. Next, we found that CSFV infection not only induced ER stress and subsequently activated three unfolded protein responses (UPR) pathways including protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) pathways, but also triggered complete autophagy in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. However, only the IRE1 pathway and no autophagy were activated in some other nonimmune organs with slighter pathologies and lower viral loads. These results indicate a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy, both of which are associated with the CSFV replication in vivo. We further performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection activates the PERK and IRE1 pathways and autophagy in cultured porcine kidney cell lines (PK-15) and macrophage cell lines (3D4/2), and pharmacological regulation of ER stress remarkably changed autophagic activities induced by CSFV, suggesting that CSFV-induced autophagy can be mediated by ER stress possibly via the PERK and IRE1 pathway. Furthermore, treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered copy numbers of NS5B genes, expression of Npro proteins, and viral titers in CSFV-infected cells or in cells treated with autophagy regulators prior to CSFV infection, suggesting the requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy for CSFV replication in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CSFV induces ER stress-mediated autophagy to sustain its replication in vivo and in vitro, which may be one of the potential strategies exploited by CSFV for immune evasion. This finding will provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and development of new strategies for controlling CSF.","publish_time":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Erpeng; Chen, Wenxian; Qin, Yuwei; Ma, Shengming; Fan, Shuangqi; Wu, Keke; Li, Wenhui; Fan, Jindai; Yi, Lin; Ding, Hongxing; Chen, Jinding; Zhao, Mingqiu","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fd8ed092a2b2e87a796cc59ccf3f7122c05fd44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6861840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798542/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Endoplasmic"],"organizations":["CSFV","ATF","PERK","ER","CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CSFV replication","CSFV infection","CSFV-induced autophagy","CSFV-induced ER stress","pathogenesis of CSFV","viral loads of CSFV","ER stress regulators","requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy","CSFV-infected cells","ER kinase","autophagy regulators","viral replication","complete autophagy","pharmacological regulation of ER stress","mechanisms of replication","IRE1 pathways","viral titers","higher viral loads","lower viral loads","PERK","partial nonimmune organs","main immune organs","kinds of infected organs","potential strategies","infection of classical swine fever virus","protein kinase R","macrophage cell lines","development of new strategies","immune evasion","potential link","new insights","cultured porcine kidney cell lines","unfolded protein responses","severer pathological injuries","PK","UPR","copy numbers of NS5B genes","expression of Npro proteins","slighter pathologies","significant roles","inositol","autophagic activities","3D4","pig model","extent","degree of tissue lesions","Endoplasmic reticulum","finding","ATF","transcription factor","animal viruses","enzyme","results","treatment","relationship","data","study","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Qatar is a such country and point of the interest in this article. Qatar\u0027s political and economic structure, its efforts to diversify its economy, and the potential for improved entrepreneurial outcomes with high value-added products, services, businesses, and industries are analyzed.

The pairing of a male worm with a female worm residing in the gynaecophoral canal of male plays a critical role in the development of female parasite. Because the male specific gynaecophoral canal protein of Schistosoma japonicum (SjGCP) is found in significant quantities in the adult female worm after pairing, it could play an important role in parasite pairing. METHODS: In the present study, three small interfering (si)RNA duplexes targeting the SjGCP gene were designed, synthesized and the silencing effects were evaluated in vitro as well as in mice infected with S. japonicum in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies using semi\u2010quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR revealed the reduction of SjGCP at the transcript level. Similarly, western blotting and immunofluorescence studies showed its reduction at the protein level after treatment of parasites with siRNAs. At a concentration of 200 nm, two siRNAs totally abolished the parasite pairing. To evaluate such a pairing inhibitory effect in vivo, mice infected with S. japonicum were treated with siRNA and both parasite pairing and burden were evaluated. In vivo tests confirmed the in vitro silencing effect of SjGCP siRNA and revealed that the systemic delivery of siRNA significantly inhibited early parasite pairing and the associated burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrated that the SjGCP plays an important role in pairing and subsequent development in S. japonicum, and its silencing might have potential as a therapeutic approach for controlling schistosomiasis.

The past decade has evidenced the role of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs)/(IDPRs) in viral and other diseases. In general, (IDPs)/(IDPRs) are considered as dynamic conformational ensembles that devoid of a specific 3D structure, being associated with various important biological phenomena. Viruses utilize IDPs/IDPRs to survive in harsh environments, to evade the host immune system, and to highjack and manipulate host cellular proteins. The role of IDPs/IDPRs in Rotavirus biology and pathogenicity are not assessed so far, therefore, we have designed this study to deeply look at the penetrance of intrinsic disorder in rotavirus proteome consisting 12 proteins encoded by 11 segments of viral genome. Also, for all human rotaviral proteins, we have deciphered molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are disorder based binding sites in proteins. Our study shows the wide spread of intrinsic disorder in several rotavirus proteins, primarily the nonstructural proteins NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 that are involved in viral replication, translation, viroplasm formation and/or maturation. This study may serve as a primer for understanding the role of IDPs/MoRFs in rotavirus biology, design of alternative therapeutic strategies, and development of disorder-based drugs.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Deepak; Singh, Ankur; Kumar, Prateek; Uversky, Vladimir N.; Rao, C.

Various selfish elements parasitize on all cellular life forms. The relative abundances of different classes of viruses are dramatically different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the great majority of viruses possess double-stranded (ds) DNA genomes, with a substantial minority of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses and only limited presence of RNA viruses. In contrast, in eukaryotes, RNA viruses account for the majority of the virome diversity although ssDNA and dsDNA viruses are common as well. Phylogenomic analysis yields tangible clues for the origins of major classes of eukaryotic viruses and in particular their likely roots in prokaryotes. Specifically, the ancestral genome of positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes might have been assembled de novo from genes derived from prokaryotic retroelements and bacteria although a primordial origin of this class of viruses cannot be ruled out. Different groups of double-stranded RNA viruses derive either from dsRNA bacteriophages or from positive-strand RNA viruses. The eukaryotic ssDNA viruses apparently evolved via a fusion of genes from prokaryotic rolling circle-replicating plasmids and positive-strand RNA viruses. Different families of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses appear to have originated from specific groups of bacteriophages on at least two independent occasions. Polintons, the largest known eukaryotic transposons, predicted to also form virus particles, most likely, were the evolutionary intermediates between bacterial tectiviruses and several groups of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses including the proposed order \u201CMegavirales\u201D that unites diverse families of large and giant viruses. Strikingly, evolution of all classes of eukaryotic viruses appears to have involved fusion between structural and replicative gene modules derived from different sources along with additional acquisitions of diverse genes.","publish_time":"2015-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koonin, Eugene V.; Dolja, Valerian V.; Krupovic, Mart","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0db5f93e21ebb2e34ba9e73f25b88bdd45c61558.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5898234.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215000859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25771806/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215000859","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["giant viruses","class of viruses","stranded RNA viruses","eukaryotic ssDNA viruses","RNA viruses account","positive-strand RNA viruses","groups of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses","strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes","great majority of viruses","Different families of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses","limited presence of RNA viruses","origins of major classes of eukaryotic viruses","relative abundances of different classes of viruses","Different groups of double","different sources","prokaryotes","fusion of genes","largest known eukaryotic transposons","selfish genetic elements","specific groups of bacteriophages","genetic diversity","additional acquisitions of diverse genes","ancestral genome of positive","Various selfish elements","diverse families of large","involved fusion","prokaryotic retroelements","dsRNA bacteriophages","DNA genomes","virome diversity","likely roots","prokaryotic rolling circle","plasmids","replicative gene modules","tangible clues","dominant entities","primordial origin","bacterial tectiviruses","proposed order","respect","biosphere","Megavirales","evolutionary intermediates","physical abundance","substantial minority of single","cellular life forms","Polintons","novo","Phylogenomic analysis","contrast","virus particles","independent occasions"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of an effective vaccine for HIV, development of new anti-HIV agents is urgently needed. We previously identified the antiviral activities of the scorpion-venom-peptide-derived mucroporin-M1 for three RNA viruses (measles viruses, SARS-CoV, and H5N1). In this investigation, a panel of scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were designed and chosen for assessment of their anti-HIV activities. A new scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 was identified as the most potent anti-HIV-1 peptide by screening assays with an EC(50) value of 2.76 \u00B5g/ml (1.65 \u00B5M) and showed low cytotoxicity to host cells with a selective index (SI) of 13.93. Kn2-7 could inhibit all members of a standard reference panel of HIV-1 subtype B pseudotyped virus (PV) with CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic NL4-3 PV strain. Furthermore, it also inhibited a CXCR4-tropic replication-competent strain of HIV-1 subtype B virus. Binding assay of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV by Octet Red system suggested the anti-HIV-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 envelope. These results demonstrated that peptide Kn2-7 could inhibit HIV-1 by direct interaction with viral particle and may become a promising candidate compound for further development of microbicide against HIV-1.","publish_time":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yaoqing; Cao, Luyang; Zhong, Maohua; Zhang, Yan; Han, Chen; Li, Qiaoli; Yang, Jingyi; Zhou, Dihan; Shi, Wei; He, Benxia; Liu, Fang; Yu, Jie; Sun, Ying; Cao, Yuan; Li, Yaoming; Li, Wenxin; Guo, Deying; Cao, Zhijian; Yan, Huimin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3334916.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536342/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","EC","Octet Red"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HIV activities","potent anti-HIV","peptide Kn2","development of new anti-HIV agents","standard reference panel of HIV","CXCR4-tropic replication-competent strain of HIV","scorpion-venom","new scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2","PV strain","Binding assay of Kn2","panel of scorpion venom peptides","CCR5-tropic","subtype B virus","CXCR4-tropic NL4","direct interaction","peptide-derived mucroporin-M1","subtype B pseudotyped virus","RNA viruses","measles viruses","development of microbicide","antiviral activities","Octet Red system","cells","SARS-CoV","promising candidate compound","viral particle","effective vaccine","screening assays","AIDS","derivatives","members","assessment","activity","low cytotoxicity","selective index","\u00B5M","havoc","absence","investigation","\u00B5g","value","world","H5N1","years","results","envelope"],"language":"en"},

BCoV are widespread around the world and cause enteric or respiratory infections among cattle, leading to important economic losses to the beef and dairy industry worldwide. To study the relation of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is essential to understand host-pathogen interaction, evasion from host\u2019s immune system and evolution. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of codon usage and composition of BCoV. RESULTS: The global codon usage among BCoV strains is similar. Significant differences of codon preferences in BCoV genes in relation to codon usage of Bos taurus host genes were found. Most of the highly frequent codons are U-ending. G \u002B C compositional constraint and dinucleotide composition also plays a role in the overall pattern of BCoV codon usage. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies revealed that mutational bias is a leading force shaping codon usage in this virus. Additionally, relative dinucleotide frequencies, geographical distribution, and evolutionary processes also influenced the codon usage pattern.

Methods: The authors conducted a 14\u2010center prospective cohort study during 2005\u20132006 of ED patients age \u003C 2 years with bronchiolitis. The study was conducted in 10 states as part of the Emergency Medicine Network. Researchers collected nasopharyngeal aspirates and conducted structured interviews, medical record reviews, and 2\u2010week follow\u2010up telephone calls. Samples were tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and influenza viruses (Flu). Results: Testing of 277 samples revealed 176 (64%) positive for RSV, 44 (16%) for RV, 26 (9%) for hMPV, 17 (6%) for Flu A, and none for Flu B. When children were categorized as RSV only, RV only, RV and RSV, and all others (hMPV, Flu, no identified virus), children with RV only were more likely to be African American (19, 62, 14, and 40%, respectively; p \u003C 0.001) and have a history of wheezing (23, 52, 21, and 15%, respectively; p = 0.01). In multivariate models, children with RV were more likely to receive corticosteroids (odds ratio [OR] 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 8.15). The duration of illness may be shorter for children with RV (Days 8, 3, 6, and 8; p = 0.07). Conclusions: In this multicenter study, RSV was the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis (64%). RV was present in 16%, and these children have a distinct profile in terms of demographics, medical history, and ED treatment.","publish_time":"2008-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansbach, Jonathan M.; McAdam, Alexander J.; Clark, Sunday; Hain, Paul D.; Flood, Robert G.; Acholonu, Uchechi; Camargo, Carlos A.","journal":"Acad Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1838b3a9367db55f41504608341c8cf895d225ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187748.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2007.00034.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18275439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Emergency Medicine Network","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV","hMPV","clinical characteristics of children age","years","medical history","viral etiology of bronchiolitis","ED patients age","frequent cause of bronchiolitis","ED treatment","multicenter study","Samples","identified virus","emergency department","center prospective cohort study","history of wheezing","respiratory syncytial virus","medical record reviews","Emergency Medicine Network","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","structured interviews","terms of demographics","rhinovirus","nasopharyngeal aspirates","distinct profile","human metapneumovirus","corticosteroids","week follow\u2010up telephone calls","influenza viruses","authors","Researchers","odds ratio","states","multivariate models","Days","duration of illness","confidence interval","Objectives","Results","Testing","Conclusions","Methods","positive"],"language":"en"},

Rapid and accurate detection is a key component of strategies to contain spread of infection, and the efficient diagnosis of influenza-like-illness is essential to protect health infrastructure in the event of a major influenza outbreak. METHODS: We developed a multiplexed PCR (MT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous diagnosis of respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness, including the specific recognition of influenza A haemagglutinin subtypes H1, H3, and H5. We tested several hundred clinical specimens in two diagnostic reference laboratories and compared the results with standard techniques. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of these assays was higher than individual assays based on direct antigen detection and standard PCR against a range of control templates and in several hundred clinical specimens. The MT-PCR assays provided differential diagnoses as well as potentially useful quantitation of virus in clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: MT-PCR is a potentially powerful tool for the differential diagnosis of influenza-like illness in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.","publish_time":"2010-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szewczuk, Elektra; Thapa, Kiran; Anninos, Terry; McPhie, Kenneth; Higgins, Geoff; Dwyer, Dominic E; Stanley, Keith K; Iredell, Jonathan R","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a71e4139dc4ba7ca03da5d99cac0781f092d5223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2881921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20459845/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-113","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["differential diagnosis of influenza","avian influenza","MT-PCR assays","efficient diagnosis of influenza","standard PCR","major influenza outbreak","illness","multiplexed PCR","specific recognition of influenza","clinical specimens","clinical samples","clinical diagnostic laboratory","individual assays","results","accurate detection","simultaneous diagnosis of respiratory viruses","differential diagnoses","health infrastructure","major public health threat","standard techniques","direct antigen detection","diagnostic reference laboratories","haemagglutinin subtypes H1","key component of strategies","useful quantitation of virus","H3","event","range of control templates","powerful tool","spread of infection","specificity","H5","sensitivity","countries","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

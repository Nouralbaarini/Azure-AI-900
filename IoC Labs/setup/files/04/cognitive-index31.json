The detailed biological features of this attenuated virus remain to be further investigated. Experimental inoculation with EIAVDLV121 did not result in clinical symptoms even with immunosuppressive treatment in our previous studies. Here, we further investigated whether the replication of the vaccine strain EIAVDLV121 in experimentally infected horses causes histopathological lesions to develop in the targeted organs. Both the lungs and the spleen have been demonstrated to support EIAV replication. By evaluating the gross macroscopic and histological changes, we found that EIAVDLV121 did not cause detectable histopathological lesions and that it replicated several hundred times more slowly than its parental virulent strain, EIAVLN40, in tissues. Immunochemical assays of these tissues indicated that the primary target cells of EIAVDLV121 were monocytes/macrophages, but that EIAVLN40 also infected alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, both of these viral strains promoted the up- and down-regulation of the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, implicating the potential involvement of these cellular factors in the pathological outcomes of EIAV infection and host immune responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the EIAV vaccine strain does not cause obvious histopathological lesions or clinical symptoms and that it induces a unique cytokine response profile. These features are considered essential for EIAVDLV121 to function as an effective live vaccine.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qiang; Ma, Jian; Wang, Xue-Feng; Xiao, Fei; Li, Li-Jia; Zhang, Jiao-Er; Lin, Yue-Zhi; Du, Cheng; He, Xi-Jun; Wang, Xiaojun; Zhou, Jian-Hua","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d1cc919114cd1f5a24e66191a11812dca3c1062.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112881.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26832985/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016524271630006X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.01.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016524271630006X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine strain EIAVDLV121","EIAV vaccine strain","EIAV replication","EIAVLN40","primary target cells of EIAVDLV121","parental virulent strain","obvious histopathological lesions","detectable histopathological lesions","effective live vaccine","pathological outcomes of EIAV infection","natural EIAV infection conditions","clinical symptoms","tissues","alveolar epithelial cells","vascular endothelial cells","attenuated virus","infected horses","live equine infectious anemia virus","detailed biological features","laboratory","monocytes","cellular factors","chemokines","immunosuppressive treatment","host immune responses","attenuation","potential involvement","protective immunity","expression of various cytokines","histological changes","macrophages","unique cytokine response profile","regulation","previous studies","results","targeted organs","addition","viral strains","Immunochemical assays","times","spleen","Experimental inoculation","lungs"],"language":"en"},

A pan-dengue virus (DENV) RT-iiPCR, targeting the 5\u2019 untranslated region, was validated previously on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system (involving separate devices for nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification/detection) to offer performance comparable to a laboratory real-time PCR. Working on the same technologies, a compact automated sample-in-answer-out system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser) has been available commercially for iiPCR, minimizing human error risks and allowing easy molecular bio-detection near points of need. Here, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the fully automated system by comparison to those on the semi-automated system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Testing sera containing serial diluted DENV-1, -2, -3, or -4 cell culture stock, the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR system had similar 100% detection endpoints on the two systems; i.e. at 1, 10, 1 and 10 PFU/ml, respectively, on the fully automated system, and at 10, 1, 10 and 10 PFU/ml, respectively, on the semi-automated system. Furthermore, both fully automated and semi-automated PCR system can detect all four DENV serotypes in mosquitos. Clinical performance of the reagent on the two systems was evaluated by testing 60 human serum samples. Both systems detected the same 40 samples (ten DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 positive each) and did not detect the other 20; 100% agreement (\u03BA = 1) was found between the two systems. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With performance comparable to a previously validated system, the fully-automated PCR system allows applications of the pan-DENV reagent as a useful tool near points of need to facilitate easy, fast and effective detection of dengue virus and help mitigate versatile public health challenges in the control and management of dengue disease.","publish_time":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Jih-Jin; Liu, Wei-Liang; Lin, Ping-Chang; Huang, Bo-Yi; Tsai, Ching-Yi; Lee, Pei-Yu Alison; Tsai, Yun-Long; Chou, Pin-Hsing; Chung, Simon; Liu, Li-Teh; Chen, Chun-Hong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cef5ad67e84f17e96de7c2d9af64487a4637cb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6619671.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["semi-automated system","semi-automated PCR system","validated system","pan-DENV RT-iiPCR system","semi-automated POCKIT combo system","pan-DENV reagent","DENV serotypes","systems","compact automated sample","consistent PCR amplification","detection endpoints","pan-dengue virus","serial diluted DENV","performance comparable","clinical performance","effective detection of dengue virus","insulated isothermal PCR","laboratory real-time PCR","easy molecular bio-detection","points of need","PFU","nucleic acid extraction","management of dengue disease","human serum samples","POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser","Testing sera","human error risks","help","separate devices","technology","control","versatile public health challenges","answer","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","applications","useful tool","METHODOLOGY","simple heating device","cell culture stock","comparison","BACKGROUND","technologies","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","mosquitos","untranslated region","agreement"],"language":"en"},

Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various strategies employed by the virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels by deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs). METHODS: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action). The frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in heavy and light chain V-gene lineage usage than the cDNA libraries, indicating that the human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have more potential than the cDNA repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. However, we found relatively high frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions that used the same V-genes and had the same CDR3 lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage. B-cells bearing B-cell receptors of such heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions may be stimulated to induce HIV-1 bnAbs.","publish_time":"2013-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yu; Yuan, Tingting; Li, Jingjing; Zhang, Yanyu; Xu, Jianqing; Shao, Yiming; Chen, Zhiwei; Zhang, Mei-Yun","journal":"AIDS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a41e8928ee5cb212550be0620946d6e62c34b001.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3815086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24100711/; https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000000015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IMGT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human gDNA antibody libraries","effective HIV","neutralizing HIV","cDNA antibody libraries","human gDNA antibody gene repertoires","cDNA libraries","human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected","cDNA repertoires","frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV","human antibodies","lambda light chain variable regions","light chain V-gene lineage usage","kappa","Combinatorial gDNA","cDNA levels","frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs","J-gene usage","high frequencies","V-genes","monoclonal bnAbs","infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","identical V","B-cells","infected individuals","deep sequencing","J recombinations","B-cell receptors","high-throughput sequence analysis","IMGT","genomic DNA","virus","sequences","PBMCs","CONCLUSION","CDR3 lengths","gDNAs","vaccine","METHODS","HighV-QUEST software","host immune surveillance","DESIGN","various strategies","mRNAs","RESULTS","challenging goal","OBJECTIVES","Extensive studies"],"language":"en"},

We obtained lung and brain tissues as well as the blood samples from the two deceased cases (patient No. 1 and 2), and bronchoscopy lavages and cerebrospinal fluid samples from one severe case (patient No. 3), respectively. All samples were tested by pathological examination, high-throughput sequencing, and real-time PCR.

We conclude that H. capsulatum was the causative pathogen of this disease cluster based on epidemiologic, clinical, pathological and nucleic acid evidence.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ji; Zhou, Weimin; Ling, Hua; Dong, Xiaoping; Zhang, Yi; Li, Jiandong; Zhang, Yong; Song, Jingdong; Liu, William J.; Li, Yang; Zhang, Ruiqing; Zhen, Wei; Cai, Kun; Zhu, Shuangli; Wang, Dongyan; Xiao, Jinbo; Tong, Yigang; Liu, Wenli; Song, Lihua; Wu, Wei; Liu, Yang; Zhao, Xiang; Wang, Ruihuan; Ye, Sheng; Wang, Jing; Lu, Roujian; Huang, Baoying; Ye, Fei; Lei, Wenwen; Gao, Rongbao; Shi, Qi; Chen, Cao; Han, Jun; Xu, Wenbo; Gao, George F.; Ma, Xuejun; Wu, Guizhen","journal":"Biosafety and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81aa63cb5ec235f7d4fcb90c8eac407589a3f37b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300473; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300473","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Matthews Ridge","Chongqing Bosai Mining Company","PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["lung tissue of patient","blood samples","capsulatum","lung tissue sample","unexplained disease cluster","cerebrospinal fluid samples","pathological examination","deceased cases","generation sequencing","Pathological detection","Nanopore sequencing","severe case","high-throughput sequencing","manganese mining of Guyana","Real-time PCR assays","blood serum","unexplained fever","viral infection","brain tissues","fungal infection","employees of Chongqing Bosai Mining Company","China","Matthews Ridge","structures","presence of spore","nucleic acid evidence","transmission","bronchoscopy lavages","identification of Histoplasma","specific fragments of","causative pathogen","existing of","bat feces"],"language":"en"},

Xiao and DA (three types of DA identified) were found to have been derived from several donor sites and have spread to 30 loci in the human genome, totaling to 5 Mb. Our bioinformatics analyses with the released human, chimp, rhesus macaque, orangutan, and marmoset genomic sequences indicate that DA and Xiao emerged ~25 million years (Myr) ago. RESULTS: To better understand the evolution of these two complex elements, we investigated various internal junctions of DA and Xiao as well as orthologous genomic sites of the 30 DA/Xiao loci in non-human primates including great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and a prosimian. We found that Xiao and type I DA first emerged in the genome between 25 and 18 Myr ago, whereas type II and Type III DAs emerged between 14 and 7 Myr ago. Xiao and DA were most active in great apes, with their amplification peaking during 25-14 and 14-7 Myr ago, respectively. Neither DA nor Xiao seem to have been active in the human and chimp genomes during last 6 Myr. CONCLUSION: The study has led to a more accurate age determination of the DA and Xiao elements than our previous bioinformatics analyses, and indicates that the amplification activity of the elements coincided with that of group I HERV-Es during evolution. It has also illustrated an evolutionary path with stepwise structural changes for the elements during past 25 Myr, and in doing so has shed more light on these two intriguing and complex elements that have reshaped our genome.","publish_time":"2009-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xuanyang; Slife, Jennifer; Patel, Neil; Zhao, Shaying","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a2fe662fce281e831bf7706e83d7b399b367167.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2700803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-9-128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19500371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Xiao"],"organizations":["DA","DA/Xiao"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Xiao elements","Myr","Xiao loci","types of DA","complex elements","human genome","various internal junctions of DA","great apes","released human","lesser apes","non-human primates","Old World monkeys","New World monkeys","orthologous genomic sites","previous bioinformatics analyses","chimp genomes","amplification peaking","amplification activity","donor sites","marmoset genomic sequences","rhesus macaque","orangutan","LTR","stepwise structural changes","composite long terminal repeat","accurate age determination","evolutionary path","retrotransposon","group","HERV-Es","prosimian","DAs","Chinese","study","light","Mb","years","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (\u003E37.3\u2103), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage \u2265 2/rectal cancer T stage \u2265 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it\u0027s caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Y H; Peng, J S","journal":"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074786/; https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020.02.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","NCCN","NCP"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["NCP","emergency surgery","gastrointestinal cancer","malignant tumor","subsequent surgery","benign tumor","Prevention measures","gastric cancer T stage","treatment of gastrointestinal tumors","non-surgical anti-tumor therapy","post-surgery abdominal infection","Surgical intervention","Surgical operation","emergency operation","rectal cancer T stage","lower digestive tract surgery","screen-negative admitted patients","stent placement","medical staffs","gastric tube decompression","unresectable colon cancer","multidisciplinary therapy","days","Medical instruments","alternative treatment measures","Neoadjuvant therapy","Tertiary prevention measure","public health emergency","disease control","fever","medical goggle protection","simple intestinal obstruction","Single-room isolation","local CDC department","alternative choice","cross infection","local center","health agencies","great efforts","travel history","operating room","false negative","invasive intervention","standardized procedures","standard procedures","Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation","acute uncontrolled bleeding","enteral nutrition supply","joint efforts of doctors","designated isolation area","special period","percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy","indications of NCCN guideline","additional face mask","hemostasis","MDT","chest CT scan","Real-time RT-PCR panel","pre-admission screening","anesthetists","residents","inflammation","EGJ","respiratory droplet transmission","Preventive enterostomy","colorectal malignancy","advanced stages","Transcatheter arterial embolization","related examinations","Hubei Province","Wuhan district","novel coronavirus pneumonia","awareness","esophagogastricjunction","high success rate","Chinese authorities","minimal level","better condition","outbreak","order","China","higher priority","clinical practice","symptoms","cases","surgeons"],"language":"en"},

It can cause extreme dehydration and death in neonatal piglets. In Asia, modified live attenuated vaccines have been used to control PEDV infection in recent years. However, a new strain of PEDV that belongs to genogroup 2a appeared in the USA in 2013 and then quickly spread to Canada and Mexico as well as Asian and European countries. Due to the less effective protective immunity provided by the vaccines against this new strain, it has caused considerable agricultural and economic loss worldwide. The emergence of this new strain increases the importance of understanding PEDV as well as strategies for inhibiting it. Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases, are ideal antiviral targets because of their essential roles in viral maturation.

However, to realize this bio-medical potential, a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map is required in order to accomplish disease and phenotype association discovery. DESCRIPTION: To remedy this, we generated 3,178,297 paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence reads from seven cats, and combined these data with the publicly available 2X cat whole genome sequence. All sequence reads were assembled together to form a 3X whole genome assembly allowing the discovery of over three million SNPs. To reduce potential false positive SNPs due to the low coverage assembly, a low upper-limit was placed on sequence coverage and a high lower-limit on the quality of the discrepant bases at a potential variant site. In all domestic cats of different breeds: female Abyssinian, female American shorthair, male Cornish Rex, female European Burmese, female Persian, female Siamese, a male Ragdoll and a female African wildcat were sequenced lightly. We report a total of 964 k common SNPs suitable for a domestic cat SNP genotyping array and an additional 900 k SNPs detected between African wildcat and domestic cats breeds. An empirical sampling of 94 discovered SNPs were tested in the sequenced cats resulting in a SNP validation rate of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a large collection of mapped feline SNPs across the cat genome that will allow for the development of SNP genotyping platforms for mapping feline diseases.","publish_time":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mullikin, James C; Hansen, Nancy F; Shen, Lei; Ebling, Heather; Donahue, William F; Tao, Wei; Saranga, David J; Brand, Adrianne; Rubenfield, Marc J; Young, Alice C; Cruz, Pedro; Driscoll, Carlos; David, Victor; Al-Murrani, Samer WK; Locniskar, Mary F; Abrahamsen, Mitchell S; O\u0027Brien, Stephen J; Smith, Douglas R; Brockman, Jeffrey A","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97e07d83db421faee2a7a42a0e2c8a117c08b016.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2996934.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-11-406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20576142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["female Abyssinian","female Persian","female Siamese","feline coronavirus","discovered SNPs","cat genome","genome sequence","female African wildcat","domestic cats breeds","feline leukemia virus","domestic cat SNP genotyping array","large collection of mapped feline SNPs","potential false positive SNPs","sequence coverage","sequenced cats","sequence reads","domestic cats of different breeds","female European Burmese","female American shorthair","deadly feline viruses","mapping feline diseases","common SNPs suitable","feline immunodeficiency virus - FIV","genome assembly","development of SNP genotyping platforms","enormous genomic potential","SNP validation rate","low coverage assembly","potential variant site","bio-medical potential","data","high lower-limit","low upper-limit","paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence","male Ragdoll","veterinary description","male Cornish Rex","hereditary disease models","phenotype association discovery","high density single nucleotide polymorphism","FECV","FeLV","discrepant bases","cancer","homologues","quality","order","occurrence","human scourges","SARS","empirical sampling","total","AIDS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020. The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate. Using a modification of the Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities. Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to achieve an effective social distancing. This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence. We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19. Our model is fitted to the available data. The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used to estimate the contact rates, infectious periods and mortality rate using both confirmed cases (by date of symptoms initiation), and daily mortality. Data on deaths after march 23rd, 2020 is used to estimate the mortality rate after the mitigation measures are implemented. Our simulations indicate that the most likely dates for maximum incidence are between late May and early June, 2020 under a scenario of high SEM compliance and low SEM abandonment rate.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acu\u00F1a-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian; Santana-Cibrian, Mario; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X.","journal":"Math Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50c5f3aea7de540ff9ab2d1869d59e51af5851e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202859.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420300596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387384/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420300596?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["mortality rate","effective contact rate","time-varying contact rate","low SEM abandonment rate","control measures","strict mitigation measures","population subject","contact rates","maximum COVID","community transmission of COVID","Abstract Sanitary Emergency Measures","scenario of high SEM compliance","average time","population-level impact","proportion of people","daily mortality","suspension of non-essential activities","maximum incidence","Mexico","trade-off","study","time horizon necessary","lower community transmission","effect of behavioral changes","effective social distancing","confirmed cases","Healthy Distance Sanitary action","available data","Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model","key factors","implementation of behavior","infectious periods","date of symptoms initiation","likely dates","consequences of disease","individual","optimum value","modification","initial phase","epidemic","simulations","deaths","aim"],"language":"en"},

Methods This is a retrospective case-control study comparing patients with and those without NVHAP from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,300-bed urban academic medical center in St. Louis, Missouri. Results One hundred seventy-four consecutive patients with NVHAP were enrolled. A random sample of 696 control patients matched by age, sex, race, and hospital admission date were selected from a total of 5,322 potential matched control subjects. NVHAP was pathogen-negative in 98 cases (56.3%). Respiratory viruses were identified in 42 patients (24.1%), gram-negative bacteria were seen in 25 patients (14.4%), and gram-positive bacteria were identified in 20 patients (11.5%). Individuals in whom NVHAP developed were more likely to die (15.5% vs 1.6%; P \u003C .01), to require intensive care (56.3% vs 22.8%; P \u003C .01) or mechanical ventilation (19.0% vs 3.9%; P \u003C 0.01), and to have a longer hospital length of stay (15.9 days [range, 9.8-26.3 days] vs 4.4 days [range, 2.9-7.3 days]; P \u003C 0.01). This case-control study identified a strong association between hospital mortality and NVHAP, with patients who acquired NVHAP having an 8.4 times greater odds of death (95% CI, 5.6-12.5). Conclusions The occurrence of NVHAP was associated with significant increases in mortality, the use of intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. We also found that respiratory viruses were an important cause of NVHAP.

We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.

Infection might lead to hemorrhage, while a recent study showed an increased risk of myocardial infarction during or shortly after PUUV infection. The mechanism by which this hantavirus influences the coagulation system remains unknown. Therefore we aimed to elucidate mechanisms explaining alterations seen in primary and secondary hemostasis during PUUV infection. By using low passage PUUV isolates to infect primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) we were able to show alterations in the regulation of primary- and secondary hemostasis and in the release of fibrinolysis regulators. Our main finding was an activation of secondary hemostasis due to increased tissue factor (TF) expression leading to increased thrombin generation in a functional assay. Furthermore, we showed that during infection platelets adhered to HUVEC and subsequently specifically to PUUV virus particles. Infection of HUVEC with PUUV did not result in increased von Willebrand factor while they produced more plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) compared to controls. The PAI-1 produced in this model formed complexes with vitronectin. This is the first report that reveals a potential mechanism behind the pro-coagulant changes in PUUV patients, which could be the result of increased thrombin generation due to an increased TF expression on endothelial cells during infection. Furthermore, we provide insight into the contribution of endothelial cell responses regarding hemostasis in PUUV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2015-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goeijenbier, Marco; Meijers, Joost C.

Existing antivirals cannot cure HBV or eliminate risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) can inhibit HBV replication, but promote virion secretion and hepatocellular cancer cell invasion. For these reasons, the overall effect of GRP78 on HBV production and whether to utilize the HBV replication-inhibitory effect of GRP78 up-regulation or the hepatocellular cancer cell invasion-inhibitory effect of its down-regulation were further investigated in order to improve the efficacy of current antiviral therapy. METHODS: GRP78 regulations in HepG2.2.15 cells were conducted by transfections of expressing vector and small interfering RNA, respectively. The changes in HBV replication, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) synthesis and hepatoma cell motility were monitored. RESULTS: GRP78 overall decreased HBV production due to its HBV replication-inhibitory effect time-dependently overwhelming virion secretion-promoting effect in HepG2.2.15 cells. Unlike the parental cells (HepG2), HepG2.2.15 cells demonstrated decreased expressions of the major genes in the interferon-\u03B21-dependent pathway. Moreover, the expressions of these genes were not affected by GRP78 regulations. However, GRP78 was found to inhibit HBeAg secretion and to increase the retro-transportation of capsid assembly-interfering HBeAg precursor from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol where new viral nucleocapsids formed. Furthermore, GRP78 overexpression promoted wound healing process (the motility) of HepG2.2.15 cells. In contrast, GRP78 knockdown enhanced HBV replication and HBeAg secretion, but they were abolished by entecavir and furin inhibitor, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GRP78 mainly demonstrates anti-HBV effects, reducing HBV production and HBeAg secretion. With due regard to the hepatocellular cancer invasion risk of the overexpression and the rectifiability of the unpleasant effects of the knockdown, GRP78 down-regulation may be more suitable to serve as an additive strategy to cover the hepatocellular cancer prevention shortage of current antiviral therapy in the future.","publish_time":"2017-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Nai Q.; Zheng, Zi H.; Xu, Hai X.; Huang, Ming X.; Peng, Xiao M.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fa344b02899cb75cb81db82d2cee5f624343c54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5390389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0747-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28407787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["HBV replication-inhibitory effect of GRP78","GRP78 overexpression","GRP78 regulations","GRP78 knockdown enhanced HBV replication","overall effect of GRP78","decreased HBV production","HBV replication-inhibitory effect time","HBeAg secretion","HepG2","anti-HBV effects","hepatocellular cancer cell invasion-inhibitory effect","hepatocellular cancer invasion risk","risk of hepatocellular carcinoma","parental cells","overwhelming virion secretion","hepatocellular cancer prevention shortage of current antiviral therapy","capsid assembly-interfering HBeAg precursor","hepatoma cell motility","decreased expressions","efficacy of current antiviral therapy","Hepatitis B virus","hepatitis B e antigen","unpleasant effects","major genes","small interfering RNA","synthesis","endoplasmic reticulum","leading cause of liver cirrhosis","wound healing process","cytosol","interferon-\u03B21","Asia","retro-transportation","contrast","additive strategy","new viral nucleocapsids","vector","rectifiability","transfections","BACKGROUND","regard","changes","RESULTS","dependent pathway","order","Glucose-regulated protein","future","Africa","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","reasons","Existing antivirals","entecavir","furin inhibitor"],"language":"en"},

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission. METHODS: We estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July\u2013August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines. FINDINGS: We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5\u00B72 and 7\u00B71. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%. INTERPRETATION: Dose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.","publish_time":"2016-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Joseph T.; Peak, Corey M.; Leung, Gabriel M.; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7df17379b5a79dd5917ea5f26051eef8bfe5011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5161610.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31838-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27837923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAR"],"locations":["Angola","Kinshasa"],"keyphrases":["dose vaccination","fractional-dose vaccine efficacy","fractional-dose vaccines","dose fractionation","standard-dose vaccine","case fractional-dose VE","vaccine efficacy VE","vaccine action","robustness of fractional","Kinshasa vaccination campaign","vaccination scenarios","random vaccination","global vaccine supply","IAR","n-fold fractionation","effective reproductive number","proportion VE of vaccinees","epidemic","Angola outbreak","effective strategy","infection attack rate","proportion of population","different age cutoff","simple mathematical models of YF transmission","hypothetical population","case report data","disease natural history","error","safety","ongoing yellow fever","protection","large margin","immunogenicity","remainder","course","largest reduction","years","benefit threshold","varying levels of transmissibility","conditions","BACKGROUND","susceptibility","factor","urgent need","FINDINGS","METHODS","INTERPRETATION"],"language":"en"},

Here, we described the isolation of a PEDV-neutralizing antibody from the B cell of a vaccinated pig. The antibody, named PC10, was demonstrated to target the conformational epitope of PEDV spike protein, specifically bind to the infected cells of PEDV genogroup 1 and 2 strains, and potently neutralize PEDV infection. PC10 neutralized PEDV infection through interfering with the viral life stages after cellular attachment instead of blocking the attachment of PEDV to cells.

Given the high mortality from this disease, particularly in the more vulnerable members of society, it is important to examine how best to deliver a high standard of end of life care during this crisis. This case series collected data from two acute hospitals examining the management of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 who subsequently died (n=36) and compared this to national and local end of life audit data for all other deaths. Our results demonstrated a shorter dying phase (38.25 hours vs 74 hours) and higher rates of syringe driver use (72% vs 33% in local audits), although with similar average mediation doses. Of note was the significant heterogeneity in the phenotype of deterioration in the dying phase, two distinct patterns emerged, with one group demonstrating severe illness with a short interval between symptom onset and death and another group presenting with a more protracted deterioration. This brief report suggests a spectrum of mode of dying. Over all the cohort reflects previously described experiences, with increased frailty (median Clinical Frailty Scale score of 5) and extensive comorbidity burden. This brief report provides clinicians with a contemporaneous overview of our experience, knowledge and pattern recognition when caring for people with Covid-19 and highlights the value of proactive identification of patients and risk of deterioration and palliation.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turner, Jennifer; Eliot Hodgson, Luke; Leckie, Todd; Eade, Lisa; Ford-Dunn, Suzanne","journal":"J Pain Symptom Manage","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0186a75a6d03d6e57b24914efd5b023052275398.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200379.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387139/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420302438?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420302438","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hours vs","group","life care","shorter dying phase","risk of deterioration","phenotype of deterioration","brief report","protracted deterioration","current Covid","local end of life audit data","high standard of end","increased frailty","significant strain","management of patients","significant heterogeneity","local audits","high mortality","palliative care services","value of proactive identification of patients","median Clinical Frailty Scale score","short interval","aspects of healthcare delivery","higher rates of syringe driver use","symptom onset","contemporaneous overview","acute hospitals","knowledge","pattern recognition","described experiences","severe illness","clinicians","pandemic","distinct patterns","similar average mediation doses","case series","vulnerable members of society","extensive comorbidity burden","disease","people","spectrum of mode","deaths","palliation","results","crisis","cohort","note"],"language":"en"},

These water stressors are exacerbated by climate change, as well as the growth and urbanisation of industry and commerce. Consequently, urban water authorities around the globe are exploring alternative water sources to meet ever-increasing demands. These alternative sources are primarily treated sewage, stormwater, and groundwater. Stormwater including roof-harvested rainwater has been considered as an alternative water source for both potable and non-potable uses. One of the most significant issues concerning alternative water reuse is the public health risk associated with chemical and microbial contaminants. Several studies to date have quantified fecal indicators and pathogens in stormwater. Microbial source tracking (MST) approaches have also been used to determine the sources of fecal contamination in stormwater and receiving waters. This review paper summarizes occurrence and concentrations of fecal indicators, pathogens, and MST marker genes in urban stormwater. A section of the review highlights the removal of fecal indicators and pathogens through water sensitive urban design (WSUD) or Best Management Practices (BMPs). We also discuss approaches for assessing and mitigating health risks associated with stormwater, including a summary of existing quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models for potable and non-potable reuse of stormwater. Finally, the most critical research gaps are identified for formulating risk management strategies.","publish_time":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Warish; Hamilton, Kerry; Toze, Simon; Cook, Stephen; Page, Declan","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e47cc8571fdaa3c959a68ef22f892e2f4e0691b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126443.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969719331687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719331687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MST","Best Management Practices"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alternative water sources","urban stormwater","alternative water reuse","water stressors","urban water authorities","non-potable reuse of stormwater","alternative sources","global water supplies","water sensitive urban design","pathogens","concentrations of fecal indicators","removal of fecal indicators","sources of fecal contamination","non-potable uses","public health risk","Microbial source tracking","microbial contaminants","approaches","formulating risk management strategies","summary of existing quantitative microbial risk assessment","Abstract Demands","ever-increasing demands","review paper","MST marker genes","Best Management Practices","mitigating health risks","QMRA","models","WSUD","globe","occurrence","growth","critical research gaps","energy","response","date","significant issues","sewage","climate change","roof-harvested rainwater","urbanisation of industry","commerce","BMPs","food","need","studies","waters","growing population","section","groundwater"],"language":"en"},

Nasal instillation of nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of siRNAs directed against different cytokines to mice suffering from TH1 cell-mediated lung inflammation, or of siRNA directed against NS-1 in an influenza infection model led to a significant reduction of target gene expression which was accompanied by distinct amelioration of lung inflammation in both models. Thus, this study provides strong evidence that the specific and local modulation of the inflammatory response by CaP/PLGA nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery could be a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the lung.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frede, Annika; Neuhaus, Bernhard; Knuschke, Torben; Wadwa, Munisch; Kollenda, Sebastian; Klopfleisch, Robert; Hansen, Wiebke; Buer, Jan; Bruder, Dunja; Epple, Matthias; Westendorf, Astrid M.","journal":"Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/110f20cdcecc8ba02f79f4b16cacefb9cc82709b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106047.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S154996341730148X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154996341730148X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28800875/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nano.2017.08.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CaP/PLGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["siRNA-loaded nanoparticles","local therapeutic treatment of pulmonary inflammation","TH1 cell-mediated lung inflammation","distinct amelioration of lung inflammation","promising approach","inflammatory response","treatment of inflammatory disorders","local modulation","PLGA nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery","promising new therapeutic approach","multi-shell nanoparticles","pro-inflammatory mediators","local interference of cytokine","Nasal instillation of nanoparticles","mixture of siRNAs","pulmonary diseases","mice suffering","CaP","different cytokines","significant reduction of target gene expression","calcium phosphate core","strong evidence","influenza infection model","lactic-co-glycolic acid","final outer layer of polyethylenimine","study","models"],"language":"en"},

Four hybridization chain reaction reactions are demonstrated herein, targeting N1/N2/N3 loci and human RNase P. The design of the hybridization chain reaction, herein, is assisted with an algorithm. The algorithm helps to search target sequences with low local secondary structure and high hybridization efficiency. The loop domain of the fuel hairpin molecule H1 and H2, which are the tunable segments in such reactions, are used as an optimization parameter to improve the hybridization efficiency of the chain reaction. The algorithm-derived HCR reactions were validated with gel electrophoresis. All proposed reactions exhibit a hybridization complex with a molecular mass \u003E1.5k base pairs, which is clear evidence of chain reaction. The hybridization efficiency trend revealed by gel electrophoresis corresponds nicely to the simulated data from the algorithm.

Initially appeared in Wuhan, China around December 2019, it had spread to almost 187 countries due to its high contagious nature. Precautionary measures remain the sole obliging tactic to cease the person to person transmissions till any effective method of treatment or vaccine is developed. Amidst the pandemic, research and development of new molecule is labour-intensive and tedious process. Drug repurposing is the concept of identifying therapeutically potent molecule from the library of pre-existing molecules. Materials and methods In the present study, 61 molecules that are already being used in clinics or under clinical scrutiny as antiviral agents are surveyed via docking study. Docking study was performed using Maestro interface (Schr\u00F6dinger Suite, LLC, NY). Key findings Out of these 61 molecules, 37 molecules were found to interact with \u003E2 protein structures of COVID-19. The docking results indicate that amongst the reported molecules, HIV protease inhibitors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors showed promising features of binding to COVID-19 enzyme. Along with these, Methisazone an inhibitor of protein synthesis, CGP42112A an angiotensin AT2 receptor agonist and ABT450 an inhibitor of the non-structural protein 3-4A might become convenient treatment option as well against COVID-19. Significance The drug repurposing approach provide an insight about the therapeutics that might be helpful in treating corona virus disease.","publish_time":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Bhumi; Modi, Palmi; Sagar, Sneha R.","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7dd9eb14c0ab9d29ab130b94356fb1ac2e47181.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194845.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520304008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520304008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278693/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117652","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NY"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["reported molecules","docking study","protein structures of COVID","library of pre-existing molecules","inhibitor of protein synthesis","non-structural protein","present study","docking results","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors","drug repurposing approach","person transmissions","potent molecule","HIV protease inhibitors","development of new molecule","effective method of treatment","convenient treatment option","angiotensin AT2 receptor agonist","ABT450","CGP42112A","promising features of binding","antiviral agents","sole obliging tactic","Schr\u00F6dinger Suite","LLC","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Maestro interface","current health concern","entire world","clinical scrutiny","Abstract","Precautionary measures","research","tedious process","insight","concept","countries","high contagious nature","corona virus disease","therapeutics","clinics","pandemic","vaccine","Materials","methods","Significance","Methisazone","enzyme","Key findings","Wuhan","China"],"language":"en"},

In chickens, synthetic ssRNA analog, resiquimod, has been shown to elicit antiviral response against infectious bursal disease virus infection. The objective of this study was to determine the innate host responses activated by the pre-hatch in ovo administration of resiquimod against infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection in chickens post-hatch. RESULTS: First, we observed that in ovo treatment of resiquimod at embryo day (ED) 18 increases macrophage recruitment in respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues of chicken day 1 post-hatch in addition to interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2 in lungs. Second, we observed that in ovo treatment of resiquimod reduces ILTV cloacal shedding at 7 days post-infection (dpi) when challenged at day 1 post-hatch coinciding with higher macrophage recruitment. In vitro, we found that resiquimod enhances production of nitric oxide (NO) and IL-1\u03B2 and not type 1 interferon (IFN) activity in avian macrophages. Although, the antiviral response against ILTV is associated with the enhanced innate immune response, it is not dependent on any of the innate immune mediators observed as has been shown in vitro using avian macrophage. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the mechanisms of antiviral response mediated by resiquimod, particularly against ILTV infection in chicken.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdul-Cader, Mohamed Sarjoon; De Silva Senapathi, Upasama; Ahmed-Hassan, Hanaa; Sharif, Shayan; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52a8c303b6e299b80b20975105e7c9852beec5c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6368756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30736730/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-019-1398-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ILTV infection","ovo treatment of resiquimod","chickens post-hatch","ovo administration of resiquimod","post-hatch coinciding","days post-infection","enhanced innate immune response","mechanisms of antiviral response","pre-hatch","recruitment of immune cells","increases macrophage recruitment","higher macrophage recruitment","innate immune mediators","ILTV cloacal shedding","embryo day","infectious bursal disease virus infection","study","gastrointestinal tissues of chicken day","infectious laryngotracheitis virus","innate host responses","avian macrophages","synthetic ssRNA analog","production of nitric oxide","production of pro-inflammatory cytokines","addition","Single stranded ribonucleic acid","insights","interleukin","BACKGROUND","IFN","activity","toll","TLR","interferon","receptor","CONCLUSION","lungs","objective","mammals","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Pharyngeal swabs were collected from 240 children \u22643 years of age (130 males, 110 females; median age, 5.0 months; IQR, 2.0\u201312.5 months) and tested for respiratory viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, by molecular methods. hMPV\u2010RNA and hBoV\u2010DNA positive samples were characterized molecularly and a phylogenetical analysis was performed. PCR analysis identified 131/240 (54.6%) samples positive for at least one virus. The frequency of hMPV and hBoV infections was similar (8.3% and 12.1%, respectively). Both infections were associated with lower respiratory tract infections: hMPV was present as a single infectious agent in 7.2% of children with bronchiolitis, hBoV was associated with 18.5% of pediatric pneumonias and identified frequently as a single etiological agent. Genetically distinct hMPV and hBoV strains were identified in children examined with respiratory tract infections. Phylogenetic analysis showed an increased prevalence of hMPV genotype A (A2b sublineage) compared to genotype B (80% vs. 20%, respectively) and of the hBoV genotype St2 compared to genotype St1 (71.4% vs. 28.6%, respectively).

Consequently, this has created an exigency in the search for new drugs with improved clinical utility or means of potentiating available ones. To this end, accumulating empirical evidence supports molecular target therapy as a plausible egress and, \u03B2-glucuronidase (\u03B2GLU) \u2013 a lysosomal acid hydrolase responsible for the catalytic deconjugation of \u03B2-d-glucuronides has emerged as a viable molecular target for several therapeutic applications.

Moreover, due to its role in colon carcinogenesis and certain drug-induced dose-limiting toxicities, the development of potent inhibitors of \u03B2GLU in human intestinal microbiota has aroused increased attention over the years. Nevertheless, although our literature survey revealed both natural products and synthetic scaffolds as potential inhibitors of the enzyme, only few of these have found clinical utility, albeit with moderate to poor pharmacokinetic profile. Hence, in this review we present a compendium of exploits in the present millennium directed towards the inhibition of \u03B2GLU.

To study the seroepidemiology of HBoV infection, the capsid protein was expressed in insect cells. Expression of the putative major capsid protein VP2 in insect cells led to the formation of virus-like particles exhibiting the typical icosahedral appearance of parvoviruses with a diameter of approximately 20 nm. The expressed particles were used to establish an ELISA method, and serum samples from groups of children of various ages in China were tested for IgG antibodies against HBoV. HBoV antibodies were detected in as high as 36% of healthy children under 9 years. Of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections, 31% were seropositive, and all age groups of these children showed a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody than their healthy counterparts. When divided into age cohorts, results showed that more than 48% of healthy children had seroconverted by age of 4. Thus, HBoV appears to be a common infection in children.

The capacity of hospitals to deal with the challenge from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change is of great importance to population health. This study aimed to explore the capacity of hospitals in China to deal with such challenges. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was utilized to gauge information regarding capacity of hospitals to deal with infectious diseases in the context of climate change among 611 clinical professionals whose roles pertained to infectious disease diagnosis, treatment and management in Anhui Province of China. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed on the data. Results More than 90% of participants believed climate change would have an adverse influence on population health and infectious disease control in China. Most indicated that their hospitals were well prepared for emerging infectious diseases at present, and they considered that logistical support in hospitals (e.g. administrative and maintenance services) should be strengthened for future capacity building. The majority of participants suggested that effective prevention and control measures, more interdisciplinary collaborations, more funding in rural areas for health care, and improved access to facilities enabling online reporting of infectious diseases, were extremely important strategies in building capacity to curb the population health impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change in China. Conclusions Clinical professionals recognized that climate change will likely increase the transmission of infectious diseases. Although rural health care and hospitals\u2019 logistical support need to be improved, most professionals believed their hospitals to be capable of dealing with emerging diseases. They thought that interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaborations, together with necessary resource support (e.g. improved facilities for rural health care) would be important control strategies.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tong, Michael Xiaoliang; Hansen, Alana; Hanson-Easey, Scott; Xiang, Jianjun; Cameron, Scott; Liu, Qiyong; Liu, Xiaobo; Sun, Yehuan; Weinstein, Philip; Han, Gil-Soo; Bi, Peng","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46d3b2026ee17e7cb37420a748bb33092363c341.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116943.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953618301886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29684649/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.04.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618301886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Anhui"],"keyphrases":["emerging infectious diseases","transmission of infectious diseases","emerging diseases","capacity of hospitals","online reporting of infectious diseases","Abstract Objectives Infectious diseases","infectious disease control","rural health care","infectious disease diagnosis","context of climate change","population health impact of emerging","building capacity","future capacity building","improved facilities","important control strategies","Anhui Province of China","rural areas","interdisciplinary collaborations","improved access","control measures","hospitals\u2019 logistical support","important strategies","Conclusions Clinical professionals","necessary resource support","Descriptive analysis","majority of participants","cross-regional collaborations","logistic regression analysis","management","major cause of morbidity","adverse influence","treatment","funding","roles","effective prevention","present","great importance","mortality","information","cross-sectional questionnaire survey","maintenance services","Methods","data","Results","study","challenges"],"language":"en"},

The LDV-C genome is at least 14,222 nucleotides in length and contains eight open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1a, which encodes a protein of 242.8 kDa and is located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, contains at least two putative papain-like cysteine protease domains, and one putative chymotrypsin-like serine protease domain. This ORF terminates with a UAG stop codon that can be bypassed if a -1 frameshift occurs. The frameshift region consists of a heptanucleotide \u0022slippery\u0022 sequence, 5\u2032-UUUAAAC-3\u2032, followed by a putative pseudoknot. ORF 1b encodes a protein of 155.4 kDa containing, in its N-terminal portion, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and an RNA helicase domain separated by a Zn finger domain. Another domain of unknown function that is also conserved in coronaviruses and toroviruses is located at the C-terminus of the ORF 1b product. Three cleavage sites in the ORF 1a polyprotein and three in the ORF 1b polyprotein were predicted for the chymotrypsin-like protease and tentatively delimit the mature nonstructural proteins of LDV. Six small, overlapping 3\u2032 ORFs (ORFs 2 through 7) encode proteins with calculated sizes of 25.8, 21.6, 19.8, 23.9, 18.9, and 12.3 kDa. ORF 7 encodes the virion nucleocapsid protein Vp-1, while ORF 6 encodes the nonglycosylated envelope protein Vp2. ORFs 5, 4, 3, and 2 each encode glycoproteins which may be virion envelope proteins. LDV is closely related to equine arteritis virus, Lelystad virus (LV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. These four viruses belong to a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses and are related to coronaviruses and toroviruses.","publish_time":"1993-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Godeny, E.

Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the identified CBoV strains was conducted using nucleotide sequences of the partial NS1 gene. The results indicated that 15 of 201 fecal samples (7.5%) were positive for CBoV; the partial NS1 genes of the 15 CBoV strains exhibited 83.1%\u2013100% nucleotide identity, and 75.8%\u2013100% amino acid identity; the entire VP2 gene of five selected CBoV strains exhibited 82.9%\u201396.8% nucleotide identity, and 90.4%\u201399.1% amino acid identity. The 15 CBoV strains exhibited high co-infection rates with CPV-2 (40%), CCoV (20%), and CaKV (26.67%). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial NS1 gene revealed that the 15 CBoV strains were divided into different subgroups of CBoV-2 when compared with CBoV-2 strains from South Korea, USA, Germany, and Hong Kong in China. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene indicated that five selected CBoV strains were divided into three different genetic groups of CBoV-2, involving in CBoV-2HK group, CBoV-2C group, and CBoV-2B group. The recombination analysis using the entire VP2 gene revealed three potential recombination events that occurred among five selected strains in our study. These data demonstrated that the CBoV strains circulating in Heilongjiang province, Northeast China showed genetic diversities, potential recombination events, and high co-infection rate.

However, and this aspect is less well appreciated, the extracellular and intracellular redox milieu is integral to many processes underlying T cell activation, proliferation and apoptosis.

The paper uses the \u2018weighted sum model\u2019 technique in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and the \u2018additive utility model\u2019 in analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multi-criteria decision making, to develop the model from first principles. It discusses the development of key performance indicators encapsulated within the analytical model. It concludes by discussing other potential applications of the proposed model and methodology for process automation as part of integrated sustainability appraisal in infrastructure design and construction.

Although essential for infection control, contact isolation has recently been associated with adverse effects in patients. We undertook a systematic review to determine whether contact isolation leads to psychological or physical problems for patients. Studies were included if (1) hospitalised patients were placed under isolation precautions for an underlying medical indication, and (2) any adverse events related to the isolation were evaluated. We found 16 studies that reported data regarding the impact of isolation on patient mental well-being, patient satisfaction, patient safety or time spent by healthcare workers in direct patient care. The majority showed a negative impact on patient mental well-being and behaviour, including higher scores for depression, anxiety and anger among isolated patients. A few studies also found that healthcare workers spent less time with patients in isolation. Patient satisfaction was adversely affected by isolation if patients were kept uninformed of their healthcare. Patient safety was also negatively affected, leading to an eight-fold increase in adverse events related to supportive care failures. We found that contact isolation may negatively impact several dimensions of patient care. Well-validated tools are necessary to investigate these results further. Large studies examining a number of safety indicators to assess the adverse effects of isolation are needed. Patient education may be an important step to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of isolation and is recommended.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abad, C.; Fearday, A.; Safdar, N.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2ae21f1d4f670697cbb64a560de72579d87d47f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114657.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670110002446; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670110002446; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2010.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20619929/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact isolation","impact of isolation","isolation precautions","adverse effects of isolation","patient safety","patient satisfaction","adverse psychological effects of isolation","Patient education","patient mental well-being","direct patient care","dimensions of patient care","isolated patients","hospitalised patients","adverse events","healthcare workers","healthcare institutions","Large studies","time","negative impact","number of safety indicators","supportive care failures","use of transmission precautions","behaviour","depression","higher scores","anxiety","important step","anger","physical problems","underlying medical indication","fold increase","Well-validated tools","multidrug-resistant organisms","Summary","infection control","majority","systematic review","data","results"],"language":"en"},

In this context, it results in a particular interest in the evaluation of the efficacy of existing pharmacological agents that may be used for overcoming or attenuating the severity of this pulmonary complication that has ended the lives of many people worldwide. Vitamin D and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim, taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against COVID-19 infection, possibly even through a synergistic interaction. The renin-angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 infection; and it may be down-regulated by vitamin D and melatonin in many organs.

METHODS: We enrolled children (6\u201335 months) with acute symptoms suggestive of AOM and analyzed their nasopharyngeal samples for bacteria by culture and for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR. Non-AOM group had no abnormal otoscopic signs or only middle ear effusion, while AOM group showed middle ear effusion and acute inflammatory signs in pneumatic otoscopy along with acute symptoms. RESULTS: Of 505 children, the non-AOM group included 187 and the AOM group 318. One or more bacterial AOM pathogen (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis) was detected in 78% and 96% of the non-AOM and AOM group, respectively (P \u003C .001). Colonization with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, each alone, increased risk of AOM (odds ratio (OR) 2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), .91\u20139.38, and 5.13; 1.36\u201319.50, respectively) and co-colonization with M. catarrhalis further increased risk (OR 4.36; 1.46\u201312.97, and 9.00; 2.05\u201339.49, respectively). Respiratory viruses were detected in 90% and 87% of the non-AOM and AOM group, respectively. RSV was significantly associated with risk of AOM without colonization by bacterial AOM pathogens (OR 6.50; 1.21\u201334.85). CONCLUSIONS: Co-colonization by M. catarrhalis seems to increase risk of AOM and RSV may contribute to AOM pathogenesis even without nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruohola, Aino; Pettigrew, Melinda M.; Lindholm, Laura; Jalava, Jari; R\u00E4is\u00E4nen, Kati S.; Vainionp\u00E4\u00E4, Raija; Waris, Matti; T\u00E4htinen, Paula A.; Laine, Miia K.; Lahti, Elina; Ruuskanen, Olli; Huovinen, Pentti","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44b7355ebb5f3c308a4af3897446a52946f3dd18.json; document_parses/pdf_json/26ace8fd116c3d3b2a065fe10766e23293a0f48d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/09a6daa803fb5aba5cc6ae2cef54c24c5a661d6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3571106.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445312003830; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3571106?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2012.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445312003830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["AOM","PCR","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AOM pathogenesis","Non-AOM group","increased risk of AOM","bacterial AOM pathogens","acute symptoms suggestive of AOM","nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization","respiratory viruses","co-colonization","acute inflammatory signs","middle ear effusion","pathogenesis of acute otitis media","respiratory tract infections","nasopharyngeal samples","symptomatic children","Moraxella catarrhalis","RSV","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","abnormal otoscopic signs","pneumatic otoscopy","microbes","relationships","culture","months","odds ratio","CONCLUSIONS","SUMMARY OBJECTIVES","confidence interval","CI","PCR","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Human T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) is one of the host proteins that have been shown to promote filovirus entry into cells. In this study, we cloned TIM-1 genes from three different African green monkey kidney cell lines (Vero E6, COS-1, and BSC-1) and found that TIM-1 of Vero E6 had a 23-amino acid deletion and 6 amino acid substitutions compared with those of COS-1 and BSC-1. Interestingly, Vero E6 TIM-1 had a greater ability to promote the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis viruses pseudotyped with filovirus glycoproteins than COS-1-derived TIM-1. We further found that the increased ability of Vero E6 TIM-1 to promote virus infectivity was most likely due to a single amino acid difference between these TIM-1s. These results suggest that a polymorphism of the TIM-1 molecules is one of the factors that influence cell susceptibility to filovirus infection, providing a new insight into the molecular basis for the filovirus host range.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuroda, Makoto; Fujikura, Daisuke; Noyori, Osamu; Kajihara, Masahiro; Maruyama, Junki; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Yoshida, Reiko; Takada, Ayato","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ac8877eb6917b86ee712a0cb3c169f43a0cf9d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124303.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.144; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X14019731; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X14019731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25449273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["derived TIM","increased ability of Vero E6 TIM","COS","filovirus glycoproteins","filovirus infection","filovirus entry","amino acid substitutions","amino acid deletion","filovirus host range","cell susceptibility","single amino acid difference","BSC","Marburg viruses","Human T-cell immunoglobulin","infectivity of vesicular stomatitis viruses","virus infectivity","greater ability","host proteins","different African green monkey kidney cell lines","humans","severe hemorrhagic fever","nonhuman primates","molecular basis","mucin domain","Ebola","new insight","genes","mortality rates","factors","Abstract Filoviruses","polymorphism","molecules","cells","results","study"],"language":"en"},

The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 T1-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W. Bond (1981), Virology 114, 39\u201351), showing that the six subgenomic RNAs of MHV-JHM form a 3\u2032 coterminal nested set which extends for different lengths in a 5\u2032 direction. The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus. The result may indicate a potential flexibility in the leader/body fusion process that has not been previously recognized.","publish_time":"1984-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makino, Shinji; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Hirano, Norio; Fujiwara, Kosaku","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddd687875254747862c30e116e2fe7beea13e9e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682284903350; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682284903350","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["K.

There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The daily prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the WHO website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ceylan, Zeynep","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a0f55f37503f093813b1cc00bfae123dc415b1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175852.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360907/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323342?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138817","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARIMA"],"locations":["China","Europe","France"],"keyphrases":["ARIMA models","prevalence of COVID","prediction of COVID","prevalence of Italy","daily prevalence data of COVID","epidemiological trend of COVID","best models","prevalence trends of Italy","Spain","France","different ARIMA parameters","Time series models","study","outbreak","epidemiological stage","affected countries of Europe","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average","epidemic","policy formulation","precautions","impact","necessary measures","light","idea","lowest MAPE values","coronavirus disease","Wuhan city","results","analysis","China","crisis","regions","urgent need","Abstract","spread","cases","future","deaths","website"],"language":"en"},

This paper describes a spatio-temporal, stochastic, susceptible- exposed-infected-recovered process model that simulates the potential spread of classical swine fever through a documented, large and free living wild pig population following a simulated incursion. The study area (300 000 km(2)) was in northern Australia. Published data on wild pig ecology from Australia, and international Classical Swine Fever data was used to parameterise the model. Sensitivity analyses revealed that herd density (best estimate 1-3 pigs km(-2)), daily herd movement distances (best estimate approximately 1 km), probability of infection transmission between herds (best estimate 0.75) and disease related herd mortality (best estimate 42%) were highly influential on epidemic size but that extraordinary movements of pigs and the yearly home range size of a pig herd were not. CSF generally established (98% of simulations) following a single point introduction. CSF spread at approximately 9 km(2 )per day with low incidence rates (\u003C 2 herds per day) in an epidemic wave along contiguous habitat for several years, before dying out (when the epidemic arrived at the end of a contiguous sub-population or at a low density wild pig area). The low incidence rate indicates that surveillance for wildlife disease epidemics caused by short lived infections will be most efficient when surveillance is based on detection and investigation of clinical events, although this may not always be practical. Epidemics could be contained and eradicated with culling (aerial shooting) or vaccination when these were adequately implemented. It was apparent that the spatial structure, ecology and behaviour of wild populations must be accounted for during disease management in wildlife. An important finding was that it may only be necessary to cull or vaccinate relatively small proportions of a population to successfully contain and eradicate some wildlife disease epidemics.","publish_time":"2012-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cowled, Brendan D; Garner, M Graeme; Negus, Katherine; Ward, Michael P","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca109a80be4606b07c057b94d4ebfe14a15f001a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3311561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22243996/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-43-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["international Classical Swine Fever","CSF"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["wildlife disease epidemics","best estimate","pig herd","wildlife disease epidemiology","Disease modelling","disease management","wild pig ecology","herd density","low density wild pig area","disease related herd mortality","free living wild pig population","epidemic size","behaviour of wild populations","surveillance","herds","contiguous sub-population","low incidence rates","epidemic wave","day","CSF","international Classical Swine Fever data","potential spread of classical swine fever","daily herd movement distances","Published data","contiguous habitat","northern Australia","process model","study area","extraordinary movements of pigs","yearly home range size","short lived infections","new insights","detection","approach","probability of infection transmission","spatial structure","simulated incursion","spatio-temporal","end","investigation of clinical events","Sensitivity analyses","simulations","single point introduction","culling","aerial shooting","vaccination","years","small proportions","paper","important finding"],"language":"en"},

Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2\u002B cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. Conclusions: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1lvarez Gallego, M; Gort\u00E1zar de las Casas, S; Pascual Miguel\u00E1\u00F1ez, I; Rubio-P\u00E9rez, I; Barrag\u00E1n Serrano, C; \u00C1lvarez Pe\u00F1a, E; D\u00EDaz Dom\u00EDnguez, J","journal":"Cir Esp","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Surgical Departments","General Surgical Department","Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of patients","elective surgery patients","Surgical Departments","incidence of SARS","confirmed SARS-CoV","emergency surgery","surgical department staff","General Surgical Department","incidence of COVID","average number of daily emergency surgical interventions","infection","rapid spread of SARS","mean age","suspicious of COVID","years","surgeons","need","fast pace of COVID","Healthcare activity","radical reorganization of healthcare resources","prospective descriptive observational study","pandemia","respiratory failure","cases","high prevalence area","early measures","total","peritonitis","Conclusions","Introduction","methods","presentation","Results","consultants","residents","change"],"language":"en"},

Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC\u2019s ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC\u2019s performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested. When coupled with low-cost endpoint detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateral-flow assay or a cell-phone-based fluorescence detector, the TTC will increase the availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Kamfai; Wong, Pui-Yan; Yu, Peter; Hardick, Justin; Wong, Kah-Yat; Wilson, Scott A.; Wu, Tiffany; Hui, Zoe; Gaydos, Charlotte; Wong, Season S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/743035cdbb5b95039bcf2297eecef6e2de640946.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26872358/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149150","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TTC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low-resource settings","low resource settings","commercial thermal cyclers","detection of viral RNA targets","RNA virus-based diseases","reverse-transcription PCR","sensitive detection of DNA","RNA amplification","RT-PCR","low-cost endpoint detection technologies","transmitted diseases","low-cost format","thermos thermal cycler","TTC\u2019s ability","innovative TTC costs","rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases","based fluorescence detector","dengue fever","TTC\u2019s performance","Ebola hemorrhagic fever","molecular diagnostic assays","availability of on-site molecular diagnostics","vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans","HIV","nucleic acid lateral-flow assay","cell-phone","AIDS","polymerase chain reaction","continuous electrical power supply","great step","simple approach","global health","terms of speed","improved set","use","capacity","tubes"],"language":"en"},

Antibacterial bioactive materials can be prepared by simple combination of antibacterial substances with materials such as hydrogels, ceramics, metals, and polymers, in different forms, such as fibres, foams, films or gels.

Another approach is to design the material itself to possess the antibacterial properties, especially at the surface of the material. The applications have been found in orthopaedics and cardiovascular grafts, as a means of reducing the incidence of infection. In the wound care industry, using antibacterial bioactive materials to control infection is always the first line for wound treatment. However, there are still considerable limitations, including the difficulty in treatment of the infection at depth, the control of the biofilm formation, and the development of generic and specific antibacterial bioactive materials.

METHODS: The prospective study was performed in two years. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) was performed to detect viral pathogens. All patients who were included in this study had sepsis symptoms as defined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. RESULTS: We compared 90 patients with sepsis into three groups as patients (n = 33) who had only viral positivity in nasopharyngeal swab, patients (17) had proven bacterial infection with or without viral infection, and patients (40) without the pathogen detection. Human rhinovirus (16.7%) and influenza (7.8%) were the most commonly seen viruses. A cough was more common in the viral infection group than other groups ( P = 0.02) and median thrombocyte count was lower in the bacterial infection group than the others ( P = 0.01). Patients having bacterial sepsis had the longest duration of hospitalization than the other groups ( P = 0.04). During winter and spring seaons, patients with sepsis had more viral infection; however, in summer and autumn period, patients were mostly in a state that we could not prove infection agents ( P = 0.02).

Previous research has shown that RHDV induces apoptosis in numerous cell types, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptosis induced by RHDV are not well understood. One possible factor is non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), a 3C-like protease that plays an important role in processing viral polyprotein precursors into mature non-structural proteins. To fully establish a role for NSP6, the present study examined the effects of ectopic expression of the protein in rabbit (RK13) and human (HeLa and HepG2) cells. We found that NSP6 suppressed cell viability and promoted apoptosis in all three cell types in a dose-dependent manner. We also identified increased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities in RK13 cell, and an increased Bax to Bcl2 mRNA ratio. Mechanistically, the ability of NSP6 to induce apoptosis was impaired by mutation of the catalytic His27 residue.

We have shown previously that lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and neutrophilic airway inflammation were increased in experimental RV\u2010induced asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that neutrophil\u2010related CXC chemokines and antimicrobial peptides are increased and related to clinical, virologic, and pathologic outcomes in RV\u2010induced exacerbations of asthma. METHODS: Protein levels of antimicrobial peptides (SLPI, HNP 1\u20133, elafin, and LL\u201037) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1/GRO\u2010\u03B1, CXCL2/GRO\u2010\u03B2, CXCL5/ENA\u201078, CXCL6/GCP\u20102, CXCL7/NAP\u20102, and CXCL8/IL\u20108) were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 10 asthmatics and 15 normal controls taken before, at day four during and 6 weeks post\u2010experimental infection. RESULTS: BAL HNP 1\u20133 and Elafin were higher, CXCL7/NAP\u20102 was lower in asthmatics compared with controls at day 4 (P = 0.035, P = 0.048, and P = 0.025, respectively). BAL HNP 1\u20133 and CXCL8/IL\u20108 were increased during infection (P = 0.003 and P = 0.011, respectively). There was a trend to increased BAL neutrophils at day 4 compared with baseline (P = 0.076). BAL HNP 1\u20133 was positively correlated with BAL neutrophil numbers at day 4. There were no correlations between clinical parameters and HNP1\u20133 or IL\u20108 levels. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that RV infection in asthma leads to increased release of CXCL8/IL\u20108, attracting neutrophils into the airways where they release HNP 1\u20133, which further enhances airway neutrophilia.

In 2003, a reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype appeared and became prevalent in Denmark. In the present study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection dynamics compared to an \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N1 virus by an experimental infection study. METHODS: Sequence analyses were performed of the H1N2 virus. Two groups of pigs were inoculated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and an \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. Nasal virus excretion and virus load in lungs were determined by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassorted H1N2 virus contained a European \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1-gene and a European \u201Cswine-like\u201D N2-gene, thus being genetically distinct from most H1N2 viruses circulating in Europe, but similar to viruses reported in 2009/2010 in Sweden and Italy. Sequence analyses of the internal genes revealed that the reassortment probably arose between circulating Danish \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies, and increased levels of acute phase proteins after inoculations. Pigs inoculated with H1N2 exhibited nasal virus excretion for seven days, peaking day 1 after inoculation two days earlier than H1N1 infected pigs and at a six times higher level. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 after inoculation, had a high virus load in all lung lobes. After the second inoculation, the nasal virus excretion was minimal. There were no clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N2 subtype, which has been established in the Danish pig population at least since 2003, is a reassortant between circulating swine \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N1 and H3N2. The Danish H1N2 has an \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1 and differs from most other reported H1N2 viruses in Europe and North America/Asia, which have H1-genes of human or \u201Cclassical-swine\u201D origin, respectively. The variant seems, however, also to be circulating in countries like Sweden and Italy. The infection dynamics of the reassorted \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N2 is similar to the older \u201Cavian-like\u201D H1N1 subtype.","publish_time":"2013-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trebbien, Ramona; Bragstad, Karoline; Larsen, Lars Erik; Nielsen, Jens; B\u00F8tner, Anette; Heegaard, Peter MH; Fomsgaard, Anders; Viuff, Birgitte; Hjulsager, Charlotte Kristiane","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1400d2059ba0e337608df70a17351ee9c3caa17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3851529.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047399/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Denmark","Europe","Sweden","North America"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 virus","reassorted H1N2 virus","reassortant H1N2 virus","Danish H1N2","virus subtypes H1N1","reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus","reassortant H1N2 subtype","Nasal virus excretion","H1N1 subtype","reported H1N2 viruses","high virus load","H1N1 infected pigs","circulating swine","circulating Danish","classical-swine","opposite subtype","groups of pigs","H1-genes","infection dynamics","experimental infection study","days","Europe","prevalent subtypes","Sequence analyses","H3N2 SIVs","Sweden","Italy","Danish pig population","increased levels of acute phase proteins","cross-reactive antibodies","peaking day","internal genes","experimental conditions","present study","N2-gene","Measurements of HI antibodies","elevated body temperature","North America","lungs","Asia","phylogenetic analysis","clinical sign","inoculations","lung lobes","reassortment","real-time RT-PCR","times higher level","weeks","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","countries","METHODS","origin","Denmark","CONCLUSIONS","difference","variant"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the interaction between mycoviruses and plant pathogenic fungi is necessary for preventing damage caused by F. graminearum. Therefore, we investigated important cellular regulatory processes in a host containing FgV1-DK21 as compared to an uninfected parent using a transcriptional approach. RESULTS: Using a 3\u2032-tiling microarray covering all known F. graminearum genes, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of F. graminearum at two different time points. At the early point of growth of an infected strain as compared to an uninfected strain, genes associated with protein synthesis, including ribosome assembly, nucleolus, and ribosomal RNA processing, were significantly up-regulated. In addition, genes required for transcription and signal transduction, including fungal-specific transcription factors and cAMP signaling, respectively, were actively up-regulated. In contrast, genes involved in various metabolic pathways, particularly in producing carboxylic acids, aromatic amino acids, nitrogen compounds, and polyamines, showed dramatic down-regulation at the early time point. Moreover, genes associated with transport systems localizing to transmembranes were down-regulated at both time points. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of global change in the prominent cellular pathways in the Fusarium host containing FgV1-DK21. The significant increase in transcripts for transcription and translation machinery in fungal host cells seems to be related to virus replication. In addition, significant down-regulation of genes required for metabolism and transporting systems in a fungal host containing the virus appears to be related to the host defense mechanism and fungal virulence. Taken together, our data aid in the understanding of how FgV1-DK21 regulates the transcriptional reprogramming of F. graminearum.","publish_time":"2012-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Won Kyong; Yu, Jisuk; Lee, Kyung-Mi; Son, Moonil; Min, Kyunghun; Lee, Yin-Won; Kim, Kook-Hyung","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/232dc9f3baa927facbe91722ae717e0738a73981.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3478160.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22559730/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-173","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graminearum genes","FgV1-DK21","Fusarium host","strain-DK21","Fusarium graminearum virus","regulation of genes","fungal host cells","uninfected strain","fungal virulence","host defense mechanism","early time point","fungal-specific transcription factors","virus replication","different time points","understanding","addition","Fusarium head blight","prominent cellular pathways","early point of growth","carboxylic acids","uninfected parent","transcriptional reprogramming","significant increase","transcriptional approach","transport systems","aromatic amino acids","various metabolic pathways","important cellular regulatory processes","translation machinery","nucleolus","nitrogen compounds","protein synthesis","plant pathogenic fungi","ribosome assembly","signal transduction","primary phytopathogenic fungus","mycoviruses","FHB","disease","polyamines","transcripts","report of global change","genome-wide expression analyses","ribosomal RNA processing","interaction","damage","cAMP","metabolism","BACKGROUND","tiling microarray","contrast","data aid","cereals","transmembranes","hypovirulence","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees\u2019 group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees\u2019 motivation and the doctors\u2019 recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees\u2019 tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULTS: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees\u2019 motivation and the doctors\u2019 recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P\u003C.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P\u003C.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P\u003C.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P\u003C.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P\u003C.001), fever (OR 1.660, P\u003C.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P\u003C.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public\u2019s ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gong, Kai; Xu, Zhong; Cai, Zhefeng; Chen, Yuxiu; Wang, Zhanxiang","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159055.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen","Reattending"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["hypochondriacal counselees","suspicious counselees","Adult counselees","Reattending counselees","healthy counselees","exposed counselees","COVID","different types of epidemic counselees","epidemic prevention","epidemic-related symptoms","offline visit motivation","counselees\u2019 motivation","role of internet hospitals","counselees\u2019 tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion","Online epidemic-related consultations","multicenter internet hospitals","epidemic-related online services","offline visits","offline clinic","China","behaviors","social panic","counselees\u2019 group","essential medical supports","doctors\u2019 recommendation","control measures","social distancing","outbreak","epidemiological exposure history","years","epidemiological screening","unrelated symptoms","total","important role","public\u2019s ability of self-protection","distribution similar","chance of nosocomial cross-infection","spread","novel coronavirus disease","logistic regression models","METHODS","Risk factors","median age","Cohen kappa score","study","analysis","odds ratio","CONCLUSIONS","IQR","severe illnesses","reported patients","OBJECTIVE","aim","RESULTS","shortness of breath","diarrhea","fever","corresponding effects","type groups","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

To determine the basis for this difference in neurovirulence we have studied the acute central nervous system (CNS) infection of these two viruses by in situ hybridization. Both viruses infected the same, specific neuroanatomical areas, predominantly neurons, and spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, along neuronal pathways and between adjacent cells. The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV-4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS.","publish_time":"1992-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fazakerley, John K.; Parker, Suezanne E.; Bloom, Floyd; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb9b20408b3817918563861d8e06a90734b7ef0e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290306A; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290306A","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of virus","rate of virus spread","variant of MHV","parental virus","variant viruses","brain virus titers","slower rate","days of infection","strain of mouse hepatitis virus","nu mice","monoclonal antibody resistant variant V5A13","destruction of neurons","CNS","main difference","LD50","PFU","c Byj mice","intact immune response","large numbers of neurons","athymic nu","neuronal pathways","neuronal nuclei","specific neuroanatomical areas","intracerebral inoculation of adult Balb","acute central nervous system","absence","animals","Abstract","neurovirulence","intervention","cerebrospinal fluid","adjacent cells","extent","situ hybridization","basis"],"language":"en"},

The disease outbreak was mainly observed among 2- to 4-year-old horses living in stables of a draft-horse racetrack in Japan. On comparing the isolated virus (isolate Tokachi09) with the equine coronavirus NC99 strain, no significant differences were observed in several biological properties such as hemagglutinating activity, antigenicity (in indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests), and one-step growth (in cell culture). The sequences of the nucleocapsid and spike genes of isolate Tokachi09 showed identical size (1341 and 4092 nucleotides, 446 and 1363 amino acids, respectively) and high similarity (98.0% and 99.0% at the nucleotides, 97.3% and 99.0% at the amino acids, respectively) to those of strain NC99. However, the isolate had a 185-nucleotide deletion from four bases after the 3\u2032-terminal end of the spike gene, resulting in the absence of the open reading frame predicted to encode a 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein in strain NC99. These results suggest that the 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein is not essential for viral replication, at least in cell culture, and that the Japanese strain probably originated from a different lineage to the North American strain.

This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs; 4 live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I and III) and 3-day-old (in exp. II) KO and wild-type (WT) piglets were inoculated with TCID50 1\u00D7103 PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow\u2019s colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals were euthanized for necropsy, and their intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence. Author summary The infection of villus epithelial cells by PEDV has been suggested to occur via putative sialic acid and aminopeptidase N (APN) receptors. Thus, CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene-mutated pigs that lack N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) receptors should exhibit resistance to PEDV infection even when APN, which is also responsible for peptide digestion and amino acid absorption and should not be tackled and remains intact. This hypothesis was tested in the present study by generating animals of this type; however, after PEDV challenge, they still showed clinical manifestations of infection. Although the hypothesis could not be verified by the results of the study, some of the immunological and histopathological evidence obtained suggested that this genetic alteration may lessen the severity of infection and delay its occurrence. The results also suggested that binding to NGNA is not a sufficient and necessary condition for PEDV infection of enterocytes. The null expression of CMAH by gene editing induced insignificant resistance to PEDV infection in neonatal piglets.","publish_time":"2018-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tu, Ching-Fu; Chuang, Chin-kai; Hsiao, Kai-Hsuan; Chen, Chien-Hong; Chen, Chie-Min; Peng, Su-Hei; Su, Yu-Hsiu; Chiou, Ming-Tang; Yen, Chon-Ho; Hung, Shau-Wen; Yang, Tien.-Shuh.; Chen, Chuan-Mu","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14a4a1946a19581353941ce4a09ffe0393e83902.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6ad14ceec74dc9b3d3dc6db7fc319b9dc22dc546.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/488510","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["PEDV","CMAH KO","NGNA","APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KO piglets","PEDV infection of enterocytes","porcine CMAH KO","CMAH gene","PEDV challenge","neonatal piglets","health of piglets","severity of infection","biallelic KO","clinical manifestations of infection","glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase","detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid","villus epithelial cells of WT piglets","hours post-PEDV inoculation","CMP-N","infection of villus epithelial cells","aminopeptidase N","null expression of CMAH","animals","results","hypothesis","gene-mutated pigs","amino acid absorption","putative sialic acid","Cas9 gene editing techniques","clinical symptoms","nullified NGNA expression","immunofluorescence staining","apparent outward clinical manifestations","APN","receptors","hpi","exps","occurrence","Cas9 mRNA","inoculation similar","wild-type","live founders","present study","sow\u2019s colostrum","induced insignificant resistance","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","CRISPR","necessary condition","peptide digestion","genetic alteration","pathological signs","enterocyte vacuolization","histopathological evidence","histopathologic inspection","Author summary","scores","moderate exfoliation","fertilized eggs","cytoplasm","single-guide RNAs","knockouts","Ringer","groups","experiments","binding","TCID50","glucose solution","times","day-old","infant formula","homozygous offspring","necropsy","Histopathology","intestines"],"language":"en"},

The current state of diagnosis has led to misdiagnosis early on in infection. Here we describe the use of a novel sample preparation technology, NanoTrap particles, to enhance the detection of RVFV. Previous studies demonstrated that NanoTrap particles lead to both 100 percent capture of protein analytes as well as an improvement of more than 100-fold in sensitivity compared to existing methods. Here we extend these findings by demonstrating the capture and enrichment of viruses. RESULTS: Screening of NanoTrap particles indicated that one particle, NT53, was the most efficient at RVFV capture as demonstrated by both qRT-PCR and plaque assays. Importantly, NT53 capture of RVFV resulted in greater than 100-fold enrichment from low viral titers when other diagnostics assays may produce false negatives. NT53 was also capable of capturing and enhancing RVFV detection from serum samples. RVFV that was inactivated through either detergent or heat treatment was still found bound to NT53, indicating the ability to use NanoTrap particles for viral capture prior to transport to a BSL-2 environment. Furthermore, both NP-40-lysed virus and purified RVFV RNA were bound by NT53. Importantly, NT53 protected viral RNA from RNase A degradation, which was not observed with other commercially available beads. Incubation of RVFV samples with NT53 also resulted in increased viral stability as demonstrated through preservation of infectivity at elevated temperatures. Finally, NanoTrap particles were capable of capturing VEEV and HIV, demonstrating the broad applicability of NanoTrap particles for viral diagnostics. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing, enriching, and protecting RVFV virions. Furthermore, the use of NanoTrap particles can be extended to a variety of viruses, including VEEV and HIV.","publish_time":"2013-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shafagati, Nazly; Narayanan, Aarthi; Baer, Alan; Fite, Katherine; Pinkham, Chelsea; Bailey, Charles; Kashanchi, Fatah; Lepene, Benjamin; Kehn-Hall, Kylene","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18039873296e6548af843db260806a51c5d45858.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3701711.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23861988/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVFV","VEEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVFV capture","NT53 capture of RVFV","use of NanoTrap particles","Screening of NanoTrap particles","detection of RVFV","RVFV detection","viral capture","RVFV virions","broad applicability of NanoTrap particles","purified RVFV RNA","Incubation of RVFV samples","viral diagnostics","viral RNA","low viral titers","increased viral stability","lysed virus","diagnostics assays","fold enrichment","zoonotic virus","VEEV","percent capture of protein analytes","enrichment of viruses","HIV","Rift Valley Fever Virus","plaque assays","serum samples","variety of viruses","biodefense pathogen","emerging pathogen","novel sample preparation technology","transport","preservation of infectivity","public health","threat","BACKGROUND","qRT-PCR","BSL","RNase","study","enriching","misdiagnosis","national security","elevated temperatures","sensitivity","existing methods","improvement","false negatives","detergent","degradation","Previous studies","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","current state of diagnosis","heat treatment","environment","NP","findings","available beads","infection"],"language":"en"},

The first is the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate almost every cellular process and are required for some viral infections, including hepatitis C virus (HCV). The second front is the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as the first robust tool for mammalian cellular genetics. This has led to the identification of hundreds of cellular genes that are important for HCV infection. There is now a major push to adapt RNAi technology to the clinic.

These encounters can lead to multiple outcomes from symbiotic homeostasis to mutual annihilation, undergo multiple cycles of latency and lysogeny, and lead to coevolution of the interacting genomes. Such systems pose numerous challenges but also some advantages to modeling, especially in terms of functional, mathematical genome representations. The main challenges for the modeling process start with the conceptual definition of a genome for instance in the case of host-integrated viral genomes. Furthermore, hardly understood influences of the activity of either genome on the other(s) via direct and indirect mechanisms amplify the needs for a coherent description of genome activity. Finally, genetic and local environmental heterogeneities in both the host\u2019s cellular and the pathogen populations need to be considered in multiscale modeling efforts. We will review here two prominent examples of host\u2013pathogen interactions at the genome level, discuss the current modeling efforts and their shortcomings, and explore novel ideas of representing active genomes which promise being particularly adapted to dealing with the modeling challenges posed by host\u2013pathogen interactions.","publish_time":"2012-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benecke, Arndt G.","journal":"Systems Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a341fd0daf2609052aedbd102b7a04a6e601a6a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976347/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2012_260","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modeling challenges","pathogen interactions","genome level","active genomes","modeling process","current modeling efforts","multiscale modeling efforts","case of host","pathogen populations","interacting genomes","mathematical genome representations","coherent description of genome activity","prominent examples of host","integrated viral genomes","numerous challenges","main challenges","lead","multiple outcomes","mutual annihilation","mutual influence","multiple cycles of latency","needs","host\u2019s cellular","symbiotic homeostasis","terms of functional","lysogeny","shortcomings","instance","conceptual definition","fascinating example","local environmental heterogeneities","indirect mechanisms","novel ideas","coevolution","advantages","promise","understood influences","encounters","systems"],"language":"en"},

Cryptosporidium was found in 36 of them while rotavirus was found in 29 and Escherichia coli in 15 of them, either singly or in combination. Salmonella, coronavirus or parvovirus were not detected in any of the calves. Twenty-six of the 36 calves contracted their Cryptosporidium infection and 18 of the 29 calves their rotavirus infection within the first week of life. Eighteen of the 52 infected calves developed diarrhea of microbial origin within 20 days of age; the most frequent finding was mixed infection with Cryptosporidium and rotavirus. In addition there were six diarrheic calves where no infection could be demonstrated. Only 10 of the 68 calves had neither infections nor diarrhea. There was a highly significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the uninfected non-diarrheic and diarrheic calves and a significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the subclinically infected and diarrheic calves. The importance of sucking of colostrum at the first feeding was observed. The smallest amount protecting the calves from infections was 0.75 1 given within 1 h of delivery.","publish_time":"1986-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pohjola, S.; Oksanen, H.; Neuvonen, E.; Veijalainen, P.; Henriksson, K.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88baaecf0d6277975dd10eaf729df8a8cbd28772.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167587786900334; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0167587786900334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrheic calves","infected calves","neonatal calves","Cryptosporidium infection","rotavirus infection","feeding","mixed infection","manifestation of diarrhea","colostral management","significant difference","mean times","infections","diarrhea of microbial origin","southern Finnish dairy herds","recurrent outbreaks of enteric disturbances","frequent finding","distribution of certain enteropathogenic organisms","days of age","occurrence","relation","colostrum","importance of sucking","week of life","Salmonella","coronavirus","parvovirus","fecal samples","addition","Escherichia coli","pathogenic agents","h of delivery","farmers","combination"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses, including MERS-CoV and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. They bind and remove ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses. A variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs), including the MERS-CoV papain-like protease, are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle. Together, this makes vDUBs highly attractive antiviral drug targets. However, structural similarity between the catalytic cores of vDUBs and human DUBs complicates the development of selective small molecule vDUB inhibitors. We have thus developed an alternative strategy to target the vDUB activity through a rational protein design approach. Here, we report the use of phage-displayed ubiquitin variant (UbV) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. UbVs bound the vDUBs with high affinity and specificity to inhibit deubiquitination, deISGylation and in the case of MERS-CoV also viral replicative polyprotein processing. Co-crystallization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between UbVs and MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs, accounting for the observed binding specificity and high affinity. Finally, expression of UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents. Our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein-based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing UbVs via mRNA or protein delivery technologies or through transgenic techniques.","publish_time":"2017-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Wei; Bailey-Elkin, Ben A.; Knaap, Robert C.

The mean age at symptom onset and of diagnosis was 10.3 \u00B1 4.6 years and 12.3 \u00B1 4 years, respectively. One child (12.5%) had primary cryofibrinogenemia. The common symptoms were purpura, arthralgia, and muscle weakness (100%). On laboratory examination, cryofibrinogen was positive in all patients. All patients had increased anti-thrombin III while 87.5% and 62.5% had abnormal protein S and protein C, respectively. All eight also complained of neurologic symptoms. One had vertebral artery narrowing, two showed increased T2-weighted signal intensity on the thalamus or white matter, and one had acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis on brain magnetic resonance imaging.

The Great East-Japan Earthquake, which occurred on 11 March 2011, was an unprecedented complex disaster that caused a nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). In addition to disaster stress and daily work, medical and health-care professionals, particularly nurses, provided counseling services to residents concerned about radiation health risks or mental health issues. This review focuses on the psychological aspects of the complex nuclear disaster, which was a combined artificial nuclear accident and natural disaster, and we investigated the psychological effects on hospital nurses associated with their experiences during the disaster. We looked at several investigations into the mental health of nurses after a nuclear disaster and in other situations. It was shown that mental health of nurses is impacted, not only after nuclear disasters but also in other circumstances. Furthermore, we noted the effects of extended periods of a heavy workload and daily life. Regarding anxiety about radiation exposure, nurses who had more knowledge of radiation tended to have better mental health, suggesting that education about the health risks of radiation exposure is important for health-care professionals. In summary, it is essential that nurses are provided with education about radiation exposure and its associated health risks, and also that there is a comprehensive approach to mental health care for nurses during the chronic phase of a disaster.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nukui, Hiroshi; Midorikawa, Sanae; Murakami, Michio; Maeda, Masaharu; Ohtsuru, Akira","journal":"J Radiat Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccdfa546c3c6de3c6a91ad713d56d320eac3e6e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5941163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5941163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Great East-Japan Earthquake"],"locations":["Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant"],"keyphrases":["mental health of nurses","health professionals","mental health care","radiation health risks","better mental health","mental health issues","health-care professionals","health risks of radiation exposure","associated health risks","complex nuclear disaster","Work-related mental health impairment","adverse health outcomes","disaster stress","natural disaster","severe disaster","hospital nurses","unprecedented complex disaster","nuclear disasters","knowledge of radiation","combined artificial nuclear accident","Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant","education","psychological effects","daily work","psychological aspects","daily life","effects of extended periods","residents","heavy workload","NPP","counseling services","chronic phase","comprehensive approach","real problem","context","addition","responders","Great East-Japan Earthquake","experiences","anxiety","investigations","review","circumstances","summary","situations"],"language":"en"},

However, few studies have quantified radiologic severity of LRIs. We sought to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative scoring tool, the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI), predicted mortality after parainfluenza virus (PIV)-associated LRI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of consecutively-enrolled adult patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and with PIV detected in nasal wash who subsequently developed radiologically-confirmed LRI. We measured RSI (range 0\u201372) in each chest radiograph during the first 30 days after LRI diagnosis. We used extended Cox proportional hazards models to identify factors associated with mortality after onset of LRI with all-cause mortality as our failure event. RESULTS: After adjustment for patient characteristics, each 1-point increase in RSI was associated with an increased hazard of death (HR 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05\u20131.21, p = 0.0008). Baseline RSI was not predictive of death, but both peak RSI and the change from baseline to peak RSI (delta-RSI) predicted mortality (odds ratio for mortality, peak: 1.11 [95%CI 1.04\u20131.18], delta-RSI: 1.14 [95%CI 1.06\u20131.22]). A delta-RSI of \u226519.5 was 89% sensitive and 91% specific in predicting 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the RSI offers precise, informative and reliable assessments of LRI severity. Progression of RSI predicts 30-day mortality after LRI, but baseline RSI does not. Our results were derived from a cohort of patients with PIV-associated LRI, but can be applied in validated in other populations of patients with LRI.","publish_time":"2018-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheshadri, Ajay; Shah, Dimpy P.; Godoy, Myrna; Erasmus, Jeremy J.; Song, Juhee; Li, Liang; Evans, Scott E.; Chemaly, Roy F.; Dickey, Burton F.; Ost, David E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96fc4a051f2ecc366f49ca34902324d059577798.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5957350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5957350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Radiologic"],"organizations":["PIV","LRI","RSI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak RSI","Baseline RSI","delta-RSI","Progression of RSI","PIV-associated LRI","onset of LRI","LRI diagnosis","predicted mortality","day mortality","reliable assessments of LRI severity","all-cause mortality","Radiologic Severity Index","radiologic severity of LRIs","cohort of patients","populations of patients","RESULTS","enrolled adult patients","predictive of death","increased hazard of death","hematologic malignancy","adverse outcomes","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","lower respiratory tract infection","HR","factors","parainfluenza virus","semi-quantitative scoring tool","extended Cox proportional hazards models","odds ratio","change","retrospective review","days","confidence interval","failure event","patient characteristics","adjustment","studies","BACKGROUND","nasal wash","chest radiograph","METHODS","range","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, in this study, complete genomes of members of Group C serogroup were sequenced or re-sequenced and used for genetic characterization, as well as to understand their phylogenetic and evolutionary aspects. Thus, our study reported the genomes of three new members in Group C virus (Apeu strain BeAn848, Itaqui strain BeAn12797 and Nepuyo strain BeAn10709), as well as re-sequencing of original strains of five members: Caraparu (strain BeAn3994), Madrid (strain BT4075), Murucutu (strain BeAn974), Oriboca (strain BeAn17), and Marituba (strain BeAn15). These viruses presented a typical genomic organization related to members of the Orthobunyavirus genus. Interestingly, all viruses of this serogroup showed an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the putative nonstructural NSs protein that precedes the nucleoprotein ORF, an unprecedented fact in Group C virus. Also, we confirmed the presence of natural reassortment events. This study expands the genomic information of Group C viruses, as well as revalidates the genomic organization of viruses that were previously reported.","publish_time":"2018-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nunes, M\u00E1rcio Roberto Teixeira; de Souza, William Marciel; Acrani, Gustavo Olszanski; Cardoso, Jedson Ferreira; da Silva, Sandro Patroca; Badra, Soraya Jabur; Figueiredo, Luiz Tadeu Moraes; Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando da Costa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd22fe835feb95cc3cc02e08dd38f962d4f69185.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5967719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5967719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Group C serogroup","genomic information of Group C viruses","strain BeAn974","strain BT4075","strain BeAn3994","strain BeAn17","strain BeAn15","genome characterization of Group C orthobunyavirus","genomic organization of viruses","Apeu strain BeAn848","Itaqui strain BeAn12797","Nepuyo strain BeAn10709","new members","study","complete genomes of members","Orthobunyavirus genus","typical genomic organization","nucleoprotein ORF","genetic characterization","re-sequencing of original strains","Caraparu","Murucutu","Madrid","unprecedented fact","Oriboca","putative nonstructural NSs protein","family Peribunyaviridae","open reading frame","Marituba","gap","previous studies","presence of natural reassortment events","arboviruses","febrile illness","evolutionary aspects","humans"],"language":"en"},

The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications.

Recently, intravital microscopy using multi-photon excitation of fluorophores has been applied to observe virus dissemination and pathogenesis in real-time under physiological conditions in living organisms. Critical steps during viral infection and pathogenesis could be studied by direct visualization of fluorescent virus particles, virus-infected cells, and the immune response to viral infection. In this review, I summarize the latest research on in vivo studies of viral infections using multi-photon intravital microscopy (MP-IVM). Initially, the underlying principle of multi-photon microscopy is introduced and experimental challenges during microsurgical animal preparation and fluorescent labeling strategies for intravital imaging are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined whether oral plant vaccine-encoding full-length Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice. The cDNAs coding Per a 2\u2013996 and Per a 2\u2013372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage. Adult female BALB/c mice were fed with the cabbage extracts for 21 days and subsequently underwent two-step sensitization with recombinant Per a 2. RESULTS: Per a 2-specific IgE measured by in-house ELISA in the sera of Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than in the control groups after allergen challenge but not the Per a 2-996-treated group.

CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that oral administration of edible plant vaccine encoding Per a 2 hypo-allergen may be used as a prophylactic strategy against the development of cockroach allergy.","publish_time":"2018-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Mey-Fann; Chiang, Chu-Hui; Li, Ying-Lan; Wang, Nancy M.; Song, Pei-Pong; Lin, Shyh-Jye; Chen, Yi-Hsing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2906d781d6cac5a07bf2826f620a788e3f8432ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6066233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major American cockroach allergen","allergen components","allergen challenge","hypo-allergen","control mice","American cockroaches","control groups","oral plant vaccine","important indoor allergen source","c mice","sensitized mice","treated groups","oral administration of edible plant vaccine","poor control of asthma","Chinese cabbage","cabbage extracts","prophylactic strategy","two-step sensitization","hypoallergenic clone","prophylactic role","major risk factor","allergic airway diseases","development of cockroach allergy","decreased airway hyper-responsiveness","reduced mRNA expression of IL","Periplaneta americana","infiltration of inflammatory cells","patients","exacerbations","lungs","severe clinical phenotypes","varying levels of pathogenicity","in-house ELISA","data","Adult female BALB","study","days","BACKGROUND","specific IgE","TuMV vector","comparison","MATERIALS","METHODS","sera","recombinant","CONCLUSION","cDNAs coding","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Evaluations of cross-reactive T-cell immunity to seasonal influenza viruses and human-infecting AIVs have been reported previously. However, the roles of influenza A virus-derived epitopes in the cross-reactive T-cell responses and heterosubtypic protections are not well understood; understanding those roles is important for preventing and controlling new emerging AIVs. Here, among the members of a healthy population presumed to have previously been infected by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), we found that pH1N1-specific T cells showed cross- but biased reactivity to human-infecting AIVs, i.e., H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, and H9N2, which correlates with distinct protections. Through a T-cell epitope-based phylogenetic analysis, the cellular immunogenic clustering expanded the relevant conclusions to a broader range of virus strains. We defined the potential key conserved epitopes required for cross-protection and revealed the molecular basis for the immunogenic variations. Our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to AIVs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development.","publish_time":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Min; Liu, Kefang; Luo, Jiejian; Tan, Shuguang; Quan, Chuansong; Zhang, Shuijun; Chai, Yan; Qi, Jianxun; Li, Yan; Bi, Yuhai; Xiao, Haixia; Wong, Gary; Zhou, Jianfang; Jiang, Taijiao; Liu, Wenjun; Yu, Hongjie; Yan, Jinghua; Liu, Yingxia; Shu, Yuelong; Wu, Guizhen; Wu, Aiping; Gao, George F.; Liu, William J.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5066cf95471ee885eb17e94e431fc5658cf1b1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6083907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of influenza","human-infecting AIVs","seasonal influenza viruses","T-cell epitope","new emerging AIVs","cross-reactive T-cell responses","emerging avian influenza viruses","backdrop of seasonal influenza virus epidemics","Evaluations of cross-reactive T-cell immunity","cross-protection","virus-derived epitopes","pH1N1-specific T cells","overall profile of cross","biased reactivity","broader range of virus strains","immunogenic variations","H7N9 infections","heterosubtypic protections","distinct protections","cellular immunogenic clustering","potential key conserved epitopes","relevant conclusions","phylogenetic analysis","useful recommendations","recent sharp increase","molecular basis","public health risk","broad-spectrum vaccine development","humans","H9N2","H6N1","H5N1","study","birds","members","healthy population","pandemic H1N1"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We used multicenter retrospective data, obtained from medical records, focusing on the diagnostic performance for definite PTB. We categorized patients into four groups, by radiographic activity: definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive. RESULTS: Of the 650 patients included, 316 had culture-confirmed PTB; 190 (29.2%), 323 (49.7%), 70 (10.8%), and 67 (10.3%) were classified into the definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive groups, respectively. The corresponding observed culture rates for CT radiographic activity were 61.6%, 60.7%, 4.3% and 0%, respectively. When not only culture rates but TB-PCR and histological results were taken into consideration as definite PTB, it showed 66.6%, 67.2%, 14.3%, and 0% of each CT radiographic activity, respectively. Regarding the diagnostic performance for definite PTB, radiographic activity displayed high sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 94.6\u201398.5) and negative predictive values (92.7%, 95% CI, 86.6\u201396.2), considered definitely and probably active PTB. Apart from PTB, other etiologies, according to radiographic activity, were predominantly respiratory infections such as bacterial pneumonia and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic activity showed good diagnostic performance, and can be used easily in clinical practice. However, clinicians should consider other possibilities, because radiologic images do not confirm microbiological PTB.","publish_time":"2018-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Yousang; Lee, Ho Young; Park, Yong Bum; Hong, Su Jin; Shin, Jeong Hwan; Choi, Seok Jin; Kim, Changhwan; Park, So Young; Jeong, Jin Young","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7478489aca4d8ade51ecf485914211cd3313d3b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6084932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CT radiographic activity","active PTB","indeterminate activity","definite PTB","microbiological PTB","good diagnostic performance","inactive groups","patients","corresponding observed culture rates","microbiological yield","histological results","bacterial pneumonia","chest computed tomography","respiratory infections","non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection","suspected pulmonary tuberculosis","medical records","TB-PCR","cases","multicenter retrospective data","high sensitivity","radiologic images","consideration","correlation","CONCLUSIONS","possibilities","METHODS","etiologies","negative predictive values","confidence interval","clinical practice","clinicians","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the association between early life viral respiratory infection and development of suboptimal lung health and function later in life following preterm birth. Although preterm infants with diminished lung function, particularly small airways, might be particularly susceptible to asthma and wheezing disorders following viral infection, there is evidence that respiratory viruses can activate number of inflammatory and airway re-modelling pathways.

METHODS: Employing a statistical model that is considered to capture the data-generating process of the outbreak and virus surveillance, maximum likelihood estimation of the asymptomatic ratio was implemented. RESULTS: Assuming that all norovirus outbreaks (n = 55) were the result of random sampling from an identical distribution and ignoring genogroup and genotype specificities, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7\u201336.7). Although not significant, separate estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of the GII.4 genotype appeared to be greater than other genotypes and was estimated at 40.7% (95% CI, 32.8\u201349.0). CONCLUSION: The present study offered the first explicit empirical estimates of the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection in natural infection settings.

To evaluate the efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37\u00B0C.

Following pre-treatment with either nebulised lamellar lipids or saline, anaesthetised sheep were prescribed fractionated radiotherapy (30 Gray (Gy) total dose in five 6 Gy fractions at 3\u20134 days intervals) to a defined unilateral lung volume. Gross pathology in radio-exposed lung 37 days after the first radiation treatment was consistent between treatment groups and consisted of deep red congestion evident on the pleural surface and firmness on palpation. Consistent histopathological features in radio-exposed lung were subpleural, periarteriolar and peribronchial intra-alveolar oedema, alveolar fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia.

Given the disease severity, associated economic costs, and recent appearance of novel IAV strains, there is a renewed interest in developing novel and efficacious \u201Cuniversal\u201D IAV vaccination strategies. Recent studies have highlighted that immunizations capable of generating local (i.e., nasal mucosa and lung) tissue-resident memory T and B cells in addition to systemic immunity offer the greatest protection against future IAV encounters. Current IAV vaccines are designed to largely stimulate IAV-specific antibodies, but do not generate the lung-resident memory T and B cells induced during IAV infections. Herein, we report on an intranasally administered biocompatible polyanhydride nanoparticle-based IAV vaccine (IAV-nanovax) capable of providing protection against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV infections in both inbred and outbred populations. Our findings also demonstrate that vaccination with IAV-nanovax promotes the induction of germinal center B cells within the lungs, both systemic and lung local IAV-specific antibodies, and IAV-specific lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. Altogether our findings show that an intranasally administered nanovaccine can induce immunity within the lungs, similar to what occurs during IAV infections, and thus could prove useful as a strategy for providing \u201Cuniversal\u201D protection against IAV.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zacharias, Zeb R.; Ross, Kathleen A.; Hornick, Emma E.; Goodman, Jonathan T.; Narasimhan, Balaji; Waldschmidt, Thomas J.; Legge, Kevin L.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3268f252e2559df8ea83c97725a4412a003670ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6127617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV-nanovax","heterologous IAV infections","IAV vaccination strategies","future IAV encounters","Current IAV vaccines","lung local IAV-specific antibodies","IAV-specific lung-resident memory CD4","recent appearance of novel IAV strains","lung-resident memory T","intranasally administered biocompatible polyanhydride nanoparticle-based IAV vaccine","CD8 T cells","tissue-resident memory T","induction of germinal center B cells","systemic immunity","greatest protection","lungs","findings","intranasally administered nanovaccine","immunizations capable","Recent studies","addition","economic costs","nasal mucosa","major cause of respiratory illness","outbred populations","disease severity","strategy","virus","Influenza"],"language":"en"},

Siglec-8 is expressed selectively on human allergic inflammatory cells\u2014primarily eosinophils and mast cells\u2014where engagement causes eosinophil apoptosis and inhibits mast cell mediator release. Evidence supports a model in which human eosinophils and mast cells bind to Siglec-8 sialoglycan ligands on inflammatory target tissues to resolve allergic inflammation and limit tissue damage. To identify Siglec-8-binding sialoglycans from human airways, proteins extracted from postmortem human trachea were resolved by size-exclusion chromatography and composite agarose\u2013acrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted and probed by Siglec-8-Fc blot overlay. Three size classes of Siglec-8 ligands were identified: 250 kDa, 600 kDa and 1 MDa, each of which was purified by affinity chromatography using a recombinant pentameric form of Siglec-8. Proteomic mass spectrometry identified all size classes as the proteoglycan aggrecan, a finding validated by immunoblotting. Glycan array studies demonstrated Siglec-8 binding to synthetic glycans with a terminal Neu5Ac\u03B12-3(6-sulfo)-Gal determinant, a quantitatively minor terminus on keratan sulfate (KS) chains of aggrecan. Treating human tracheal extracts with sialidase or keratanase eliminated Siglec-8 binding, indicating sialylated KS chains as Siglec-8-binding determinants. Treating human tracheal histological sections with keratanase also completely eliminated the binding of Siglec-8-Fc. Finally, Siglec-8 ligand purified from human trachea extracts induced increased apoptosis of freshly isolated human eosinophils in vitro. We conclude that sialylated KS proteoglycans are endogenous human airway ligands that bind Siglec-8 and may regulate allergic inflammation.","publish_time":"2018-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez-Gil, Anabel; Porell, Ryan N; Fernandes, Steve M; Wei, Yadong; Yu, Huifeng; Carroll, Daniela J; McBride, Ryan; Paulson, James C; Tiemeyer, Michael; Aoki, Kazuhiro; Bochner, Bruce S; Schnaar, Ronald L","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61d88fe484fd2e0473799f9eb11f56d2612070e6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/563cdb9008f721634cd5556090aeb0eb2329532d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6142871.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/glycob/article-pdf/28/10/786/25792249/cwy057.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of Siglec","size classes of Siglec","human airways","Human siglecs","human allergic inflammatory cells","human trachea extracts","isolated human eosinophils","human tracheal extracts","postmortem human trachea","endogenous human airway ligands","recombinant pentameric form of Siglec","mast cells","human tracheal histological sections","binding sialoglycans","binding determinants","sialic acid-binding proteins","allergic inflammation","sialylated KS chains","subsets of immune cells","size-exclusion chromatography","keratanase","sialylated KS proteoglycans","sialoglycan ligands","chains of aggrecan","kDa","eosinophil apoptosis","increased apoptosis","mast cell mediator release","affinity chromatography","proteoglycan aggrecan","immune responses","inflammatory target tissues","Fc blot overlay","composite agarose","minor terminus","engagement","keratan sulfate","acrylamide gel electrophoresis","family","synthetic glycans","sialidase","limit tissue damage","Gal determinant","terminal Neu5Ac\u03B12","Proteomic mass spectrometry","model","Glycan array studies","sulfo","finding","immunoblotting","MDa","Evidence"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a literature survey in PubMed and Google Scholar using HUS, TTP, TMA, and influenza as keywords, and extracted and analyzed reported epidemiological and clinical data. We identified 25 cases of influenza-associated TMA. Five additional cases were linked to influenza vaccination and analyzed separately. Influenza A was found in 83%, 10 out of 25 during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Two patients had bona fide TTP with ADAMTS13 activity \u003C10%. Median age was 15 years (range 0.5\u201368 years), two thirds were male. Oligoanuria was documented in 81% and neurological involvement in 40% of patients. Serum C3 was reduced in 5 out of 14 patients (36%); Coombs test was negative in 7 out of 7 and elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were documented in 6 out of 8 patients. Pathogenic complement gene mutations were found in 7 out of 8 patients tested (C3, MCP, or MCP combined with CFB or clusterin). Twenty out of 24 patients recovered completely, but 3 died (12%). Ten of the surviving patients underwent plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy, 5 plasma infusions. Influenza-mediated HUS or TTP is rare. A sizable proportion of tested patients demonstrated mutations associated with alternative pathway of complement dysregulation that was uncovered by this infection. Further research is warranted targeting the roles of viral neuraminidase, enhanced virus-induced complement activation and/or ADAMTS13 antibodies, and rational treatment approaches.

Monitoring of transmissions of individuals from different age groups could offer information that would be valuable for planning adequate disease control strategies. We compared the age-specific effective reproductive numbers (R) of measles during 2009\u20132016 in Guangdong, China. METHODS: We estimated the age-specific R values for 7 age groups: 0\u20138 months, 9\u201318 months, 19 months to 6 years, 7\u201315 years, 16\u201325 years, 26\u201345 years, and \u226546 years adapting the contact matrix of China. The daily numbers of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong were used. RESULTS: The peak R values of the entire population were above unity from 2012 to 2016, indicating the persistence of measles in the population. In general, children aged 0\u20136 years and adults aged 26\u201345 years had larger values of R when comparing with other age groups after 2012. While the peaks of R values for children aged 0\u20136 years dropped steadily after 2013, the peaks of R values for adults aged 26\u201345 years kept at a high range every year. CONCLUSIONS: Although the provincial supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 2009 and 2010 were able to reduce the transmissions from 2009 to 2011, larger values of R for children aged 0\u20136 years were observed after 2012, indicating that the benefits of the SIAs were short-lived. In addition, the transmissions from adults aged between 26 and 45 years increased over time. Disease control strategies should target children and adult groups that carry high potential for measles transmission.","publish_time":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Ka Chun; Hu, Pei; Lau, Steven; Jia, Katherine Min; Liang, Wenjia; Wang, Maggie Haitian; Zee, Benny Chung Ying; Sun, Riyang; Zheng, Huizhen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36c09af15d4a614f954aae5a5f8a4199f1ff8b2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6175510.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6175510/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["years","age-specific R values","larger values of R","peaks of R values","peak R values","children","different age groups","adults","months","adult groups","resurgence of measles","measles transmission","persistence of measles","adequate disease control strategies","age-specific effective reproductive numbers","SIAs","Monitoring of transmissions","contact matrix of China","high potential","immunization efforts","high range","entire population","Prevention of Guangdong","daily numbers of laboratory","provincial supplementary immunization activities","confirmed cases","Center","individuals","information","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","benefits","BACKGROUND","unity","addition","METHODS","time"],"language":"en"},

Based on this, monoclonal antibodies are having much rapid development, such as those against CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1).But the cost of preparation of monoclonal antibodies is too high and the therapeutic effect is still under restrictions. Recently, a series of soluble immune checkpoints have been found such as sCTLA-4 (soluble CTLA-4) and sPD-1 (soluble PD-1). They are functional parts of membrane immune checkpoints produced in different ways and can be secreted by immune cells. Moreover, these soluble checkpoints can diffuse in the serum. Much evidence has demonstrated that these soluble checkpoints are involved in positive or negative immune regulation and that changes in their plasma levels affect the development, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Since they are endogenous molecules, they will not induce immunological rejection in human beings, which might make up for the deficiencies of monoclonal antibodies and enhance the utility value of these molecules. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investigating novel soluble checkpoints and their functions, and it is promising to develop relevant therapies in the future.

During blood-feeding, sand fly females salivate into the skin of the host. Sand fly saliva contains a large variety of proteins, some of which elicit specific antibody responses in the bitten hosts. To evaluate the exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease endemic areas, we tested the antibody reactions of volunteers\u0027 sera against recombinant P. orientalis salivary antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins, were produced using either bacterial (five proteins) or mammalian (four proteins) expression systems and tested as antigens applicable for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. Using these recombinant proteins, human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, countries endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, were screened by ELISA and immunoblotting to identify the potential markers of exposure to P. orientalis bites. Two recombinant proteins; mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. The recombinant salivary proteins mYEL1 and mAG5 proved to be valid antigens for screening human sera from both Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P. orientalis bites. The utilization of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P. orientalis antibody responses.","publish_time":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sumova, Petra; Sima, Michal; Spitzova, Tatiana; Osman, Maha E.; Guimaraes-Costa, Anderson B.; Oliveira, Fabiano; Elnaiem, Dia-Eldin A.; Hailu, Asrat; Warburg, Alon; Valenzuela, Jesus G.; Volf, Petr","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87cce3d733ad6f5f0d283d58b8a2b1a0dc47f99e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6279015.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6279015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern Africa","Sudan","Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["Recombinant proteins","orientalis exposure","orientalis secreted salivary proteins","orientalis bites","orientalis salivary antigens","recombinant salivary proteins mYEL1","orientalis antibodies","orientalis IgG","Phlebotomus orientalis","orientalis antibody responses","large variety of proteins","sand fly bites","report of screening human sera","human populations","Sand fly saliva","sand fly females","antibody reactions of volunteers\u0027 sera","antigens applicable","valid antigens","promising antigens","salivary gland homogenate","Ethiopia","detection of anti-","Sudan","specific antibody responses","mAG5","potential markers of exposure","high correlation coefficients","increase of correlation coefficients","countries endemic","causative agent of life threatening visceral leishmaniasis","disease endemic areas","sequence data","vector of Leishmania donovani","good specificity","negative predictive values of","expression systems","mammalian","Eastern Africa","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","bitten hosts","skin","comparison","METHODOLOGY","capability","ELISA","BACKGROUND","blood","utilization of equal amounts","SIGNIFICANCE","CONCLUSIONS","Combination"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to construct an RNA-positive control based on armored (AR) RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model. METHODS: The MS2 maturase, a coat protein gene (at positions 1765 to 1787) and HIV-1 pol gene were cloned into pET-32a plasmid. The prepared plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL2 (DE3), and the expression of the construct was induced by 1 mM of isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37 \u00B0C for 16 h to obtain the fabricated AR RNA. The AR RNA was precipitated and purified using polyethylene glycol and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. RESULTS: The stability of AR RNA was evaluated by treatment with DNase I and RNase A and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and gel agarose electrophoresis. Tenfold serial dilution of AR RNA from 10(1) to 10(5) was prepared. Real-time PCR assays had a range of detection between 10(1) and 10(5). In addition, R(2) value was 0.998, and the slope of the standard curve was -3.33. CONCLUSION: Prepared AR RNA, as a positive control, could be used as a basis for launching an in-house HIV-1 virus assay and other infectious agents. It can be readily available to laboratories and HIV research centers. The AR RNA is non-infectious and highly resistant to ribonuclease enzyme and can reduce the risk of infection in the clinical laboratory.","publish_time":"2018-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gholami, Mohammad; Ravanshad, Mehrdad; Baesi, Kazem; Samiee, Siamak M.; Rozbahani, Negin Hosseini; Mohraz, Minoo","journal":"Iran Biomed J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e4f96618ed7ba4ba54c5c479ed595f1eb12fe9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6305816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AR RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Prepared AR RNA","stability of AR RNA","fabricated AR RNA","RNA technology","RNA-positive control","Tenfold serial dilution of AR RNA","in-house HIV","prepared plasmid","HIV research centers","construct","virus assay","immune system","pol gene","infectious agents","coat protein gene","immune deficiency syndrome","infectious viral agent","human immunodeficiency virus type","transmission electron microscopy","Escherichia coli strain BL2","DE3","gel agarose electrophoresis","MS2 maturase","thio-D","IPTG","risk of infection","Sephacryl S","RNase","ribonuclease enzyme","BACKGROUND","polyethylene glycol","laboratories","positions","treatment","Real-time PCR assays","range of detection","value","slope","clinical laboratory","galactopyranoside","chromatography","AIDS","pET","DNase","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","standard curve","addition","METHODS","expression","basis","study","model","aim"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) are biocompatible, do not induce inflammation and when used as vaccine carriers for model peptides induce CD8(\u002B) T cell responses. Herein we test the immunogenicity of 24 different peptides, from three leading vaccine target proteins in gynecological cancers: the E7 protein of human papilloma virus (HPV); Wilms Tumor antigen 1 (WT1) and survivin (SV), in PSNP conjugate vaccines. Of relevance to vaccine development was the finding that a minimal CD8(\u002B) T cell peptide epitope from HPV was not able to induce HLA-A2.1 specific CD8(\u002B) T cell responses in transgenic humanized mice using conventional adjuvants such as CpG, but was nevertheless able to generate strong immunity when delivered as part of a specific longer peptide conjugated to PSNPs vaccines. Conversely, in most cases, when the minimal CD8(\u002B) T cell epitopes were able to induce immune responses (with WT1 or SV super agonists) in CpG, they also induced responses when conjugated to PSNPs. In this case, extending the sequence around the CD8(\u002B) T cell epitope, using the natural protein context, or engineering linker sequences proposed to enhance antigen processing, had minimal effects in enhancing or changing the cross-reactivity pattern induced by the super agonists. Nanoparticle approaches, such as PSNPs, therefore may offer an alternative vaccination strategy when conventional adjuvants are unable to elicit the desired CD8(\u002B) T cell specificity. The findings herein also offer sequence specific insights into peptide vaccine design for nanoparticle-based vaccine carriers.","publish_time":"2018-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Sue D.; Wilson, Kirsty L.; Goubier, Anne; Heyerick, Arne; Plebanski, Magdalena","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b28a8c489742fd2227e6e4049d777febfd4051cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315164.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315164/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG","SV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell responses","T cell immunity","T cell epitopes","specific CD8","T cell specificity","minimal CD8","T cell peptide epitope","desired CD8","peptide vaccine design","vaccine development","PSNPs vaccines","nanoparticle-based vaccine carriers","immune responses","specific longer peptide","leading vaccine target proteins","HPV","conventional adjuvants","Gynecological cancers","WT1","sequence specific insights","SV super agonists","CpG","minimal effects","inflammation","antigen processing","different peptides","model peptides","Nanoparticle approaches","strong immunity","natural protein context","Wilms Tumor antigen","leading cause of mortality","PSNP conjugate vaccines","E7 protein of human papilloma virus","transgenic humanized mice","engineering linker sequences","polystyrene nanoparticles","alternative vaccination strategy","enhanced survival","HLA-A2","survivin","cross-reactivity pattern","Previous studies","women","relevance","findings","poor prognosis","immunogenicity","cases"],"language":"en"},

Mice that had been intranasally infected with S. flexneri were rescued from death by treatment with recombinant PTX3. In vitro PTX3 exerts the antibacterial activity against Shigella, impairing epithelial cell invasion and contributing to the bactericidal activity of serum. PTX3 is produced upon LPS-TLR4 stimulation in accordance with the lipid A structure of Shigella. In the plasma of infected patients, the level of PTX3 amount only correlates strongly with symptom severity.

Within these systems, monoclonal aptamer microbeads can be individually generated and assayed to assess aptamer candidate fitness thereby helping eliminate stochastic effects which are common to classical SELEX techniques. Such techniques have given rise to aptamers with 1000 times greater binding affinities when compared to traditional SELEX. Another emerging technique is Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) whereby selection does not rely on binding capture allowing evolution of a greater diversity of aptamer properties such as fluorescence or enzymatic activity.

However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response. METHODS: We developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness. The EPI is global, covering 188 countries. It consists of five subindices measuring each country\u2019s economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity. To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: The most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The EPI measures a country\u2019s capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events. Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time. The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries. The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oppenheim, Ben; Gallivan, Mark; Madhav, Nita K; Brown, Naor; Serhiyenko, Volodymyr; Wolfe, Nathan D; Ayscue, Patrick","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0445a006b72980b50bccc09a785a688457bbede.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6352812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPI","JEE"],"locations":["Europe","North America","West Africa","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["public health preparedness","national-level preparedness","Epidemic Preparedness Index","global estimates of pandemic preparedness","existing preparedness assessments","holistic view of preparedness","public health systems","public health communications","Better prepared countries","pandemic outbreaks","country\u2019s capacity","response capacity","institutional capacity","global resilience","H1N1 influenza pandemic","JEE","infectious disease outbreaks","infectious disease events","proxy measures","Existing tools","country\u2019s economic resources","infrastructure","West Africa","reporting","Robust metrics","specific legislative frameworks","vaccination rates","Southeast Asia","Joint External Evaluation","timeliness of outbreak detection","Europe","North America","strategy","correlation","comparative risk assessment","INTRODUCTION","subindices","population","resource allocation","essential capacities","larger proportion","construct validity","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

While high\u2010throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low\u2010input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition.

This study is aimed to determine apoptosis pathways and role of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules in Vero cells infected with SBV. The study results showed that SBV induced apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by activating both caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively. Expression analyses of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak and Puma) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) genes revealed that SBV-induced apoptosis causes upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, dominantly via Puma gene, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes were downregulated.

Defective interfering particles (DIPs) can be generated in IAV infected cells due to errors of the viral polymerase and may suppress spread of wild type (wt) virus. The antiviral activity of DIPs is exerted by a DI genomic RNA segment that usually contains a large deletion and suppresses amplification of wt segments, potentially by competing for cellular and viral resources. DI-244 is a naturally occurring prototypic segment 1-derived DI RNA in which most of the PB2 open reading frame has been deleted and which is currently developed for antiviral therapy. At present, coinfection with wt virus is required for production of DI-244 particles which raises concerns regarding biosafety and may complicate interpretation of research results. Here, we show that cocultures of 293T and MDCK cell lines stably expressing codon optimized PB2 allow production of DI-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of helper virus. Moreover, we demonstrate that infectivity of these particles can be quantified using MDCK-PB2 cells. Finally, we report that the DI-244 particles produced in this novel system exert potent antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV but not against the unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus. This is the first report of DIP production in the absence of infectious IAV and may spur efforts to develop DIPs for antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bdeir, Najat; Arora, Prerna; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; Hoffmann, Markus; Reichl, Udo; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Winkler, Michael","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35c31daa44cb7fd28aeea422bb15d1a3858a2378.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6396908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI","MDCK","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of DI","wt virus","antiviral therapy","antiviral activity of DIPs","derived DI RNA","DI genomic RNA segment","novel antiviral strategies","potent antiviral activity","absence of helper virus","H3N2 IAV","absence of infectious IAV","IAV infected cells","MDCK-PB2 cells","Defective interfering particles","unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus","report of DIP production","codon optimized PB2","amplification of wt segments","novel system","prototypic segment","PB2 open reading frame","viral polymerase","viral resources","MDCK cell lines","serious health threat","H1N1","large deletion","errors","efforts","biosafety","concerns","plasmids","wild type","interpretation of research results","cocultures","present","coinfection","Influenza","infectivity"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is of utmost importance for healthcare professionals to be fully aware of Zika virus preparedness, and response measures should an outbreak occur in Malaysia in order to quickly and efficiently contain the outbreak, ensure the safety of individual or healthcare personnel safety, as well as to prevent further spreading of the disease. This research aims to show how prepared Malaysian healthcare professionals are against Zika virus and how well can they respond during an outbreak. In total, 504 healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) from private health clinics were the target population of the four states of Malaysia where Zika cases suspected. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimating the population proportion. An additional 10% of the calculated sample size was added to compensate the non-response rate. The Center For Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation provided a checklist to assess how prepared healthcare professionals are for an Zika outbreak. This checklist was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals\u2019 preparedness and response to the Zika outbreak. Community pharmacists are still lacking in their preparedness and perceived response to the Zika outbreak compared to the general practitioners in the private sector. Hence community pharmacists should attend training given by the Ministry of Health Malaysia as a continuing education, which may help them to respond during a Zika outbreak.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajiah, Kingston; Maharajan, Mari Kannan; Yin, Pua Yin; Yee, Yap Wei; Lin, Wong Wan; Kean, Chew Hui","journal":"Microorganisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37a69d36617af76ae26d7801efb776af8f7488a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6462960.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["Zika outbreak","Zika cases","spread of Zika virus","aware of Zika virus preparedness","prepared healthcare professionals","healthcare workers","prepared Malaysian healthcare professionals","Ministry of Health Malaysia","healthcare personnel safety","community pharmacists","private health clinics","health care professionals\u2019 preparedness","response measures","perceived response","Disease Control","World Health Organisation","Prevention","general practitioners","states of Malaysia","non-response rate","checklist","order","Center","calculated sample size","public health emergency of international concern","safety of individual","target population","private sector","population proportion","utmost importance","guidelines","nurses","steps","questionnaire","training","continuing education","formula","category","isolate patients","research","total","infection"],"language":"en"},

Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03B2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients\u2019 demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1\u03B2 and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03B2 cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1\u03B2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \u2264 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection\u2019s duration of \u2265 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml (p \u003C 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection \u2264 one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value = 0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \u2265 5 years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1\u03B2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression.","publish_time":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abushouk, Amir; Nasr, Amre; Masuadi, Emad; Allam, Gamal; Siddig, Emmanuel E.; Fahal, Ahmed H.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d0b98bb0c601d8a636e49bad7d2449b7dce32ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6483278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mycetoma","Madurella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high levels of IL","mycetoma patients","patients of mycetoma","risk factors of higher levels of IL","risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL","cytokines levels","duration of mycetoma infection","mycetoma infection\u2019s duration","eumycetoma mycetoma infection","disease duration","years","Mycetoma Research Centre","pg","reference group","negative significant association","\u03B2 cytokine","significant negative correlation","negative impact","disease progression","neglected tropical disease","median age","lesion size","discovered cytokines","range","unit increment","family","average","Interleukins","case-control study","University of Khartoum","Madurella mycetomatis","p value","Soba University Hospital","endemic","subtropical regions","important role","enzyme","sera","massive deformity","healthy controls","disability","immunosorbent assay","Sudan","patients\u2019 demographic characteristics","immune system","ELISA","present","groups","analysis","expression","individuals","aim","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. RESULTS: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicated that hMPV is a potential etiologic factor for the commonly occurring acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. hMPV infection was also found to be associated with complicated respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia, chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsuheel, Ali Mohammed; Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed; Al-Hakami, Ahmed Musa; Shati, Ayed Abdullah; Chandramoorthy, Harish C.; Al-Qahtani, Saleh Mohammed","journal":"Saudi J Med Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9738261ac322d052e519fb1f1297eedc917a939.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6503696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Aseer Central Hospital"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["pediatric hospitalized patients","acute respiratory infections","acute respiratory tract infections","lower respiratory tract infections","Aseer region of Saudi Arabia","presence of hMPV antigens","nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients","hospitalized children","complicated respiratory conditions","severity of hMPV infection","Basic demographics of patients","chronic conditions","Aseer Central Hospital","chronic heart disease","bronchopneumonia","serological hospital-based study","bronchial asthma","admission","RESULTS","Abha city","obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens","proportion","Paramyxovirus","clinical data","young adults","METHODS","potential etiologic factor","Human metapneumovirus","Direct fluorescent antibody assay","years","surrounding localities","common diagnosis","BACKGROUND","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVES","months","aspiration pneumonia","autumn","winter","CONCLUSIONS","date"],"language":"en"},

This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i\u002B1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i\u002B1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i\u002B5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1\u2032-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2\u2032-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2\u2032-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i\u002B1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.","publish_time":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tchesnokov, Egor P.; Feng, Joy Y.; Porter, Danielle P.; G\u00F6tte, Matthias","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2750bbcb6ecf63b2519523a2a63145167c5f8d38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6520719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Remdesivir"],"organizations":["EBOV","ATP","RNA","EBOV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["remdesivir-TP","EBOV RdRp","position i","form of remdesivir","RSV RdRp","EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition","EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA viruses","selectivity of ATP","incorporated nucleotide analogue","fold inhibition","human mitochondrial RNA polymerase","Chain termination","ara-ATP acts","ensuing nucleotide incorporation event","cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug","adenosine triphosphate","incorporated inhibitor","different patterns of inhibition","treatment of Ebola virus disease","non-obligate chain terminator","respiratory syncytial virus","non-human primates","relevant triphosphate","antiviral effects","selectivity value","biochemical studies","biochemical data","cyano modification","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","major contribution","mechanism of action","cell culture","residues","inhibitory effect","h-mtRNAP","clinical development","EVD","contrast","complex","Enzyme kinetics","similar efficiencies","presumptive target","long distance","investigation","C-methyl","modifications","cases","Compounds","GS","study"],"language":"en"},

The data of SARI patients who were admitted to SARI surveillance sites at Al Johory hospital in Sana\u2019a and Al Wahdah hospital in Aden city during the period 2011-2016 were analyzed. The proportions of positive influenza viruses (type A, B) and noninfluenza viruses (respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, human parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and fatality rate among SARI patients were calculated. A total of 1811 of SARI patients were admitted during 2011-2016. Of those, 78% were \u003C15 years old. A total of 89 (5%) patients had influenza viruses and 655 (36%) had noninfluenza viruses. The overall ICU admission rate was 40% and the case-fatality rate was 8%.

In conclusion; SARI patients in Yemen had a high ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Influenza type B, chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site are associated with higher fatality rate. Expanding surveillance sites and panel of laboratory tests to involve other pathogens will help to provide accurate diagnosis for SARI etiology and give more comprehensive picture.

Kinases play pivotal roles in many cellular biological processes, whereas dysregulation of kinases may lead to various diseases, particularly cancer. However, the role of kinases in HCC malignancy remains unclear. In this study, we employed a kinome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library, comprising 710 kinase-related genes, to screen whether any kinases were essential for cell proliferation in various HCC cell lines. Through a kinome siRNA library screening, we found that MAP3K7 was a crucial gene for HCC cell proliferation. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of MAP3K7 diminished the growth, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, including primary HCC cells. Stable knockdown of MAP3K7 attenuated tumor formation in a spheroid cell culture model and tumor xenograft mouse model. In addition, silencing MAP3K7 reduced the phosphorylation and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in HCC cells. MAP3K7 expression was positively correlated with mTOR expression in tumors of patients with HCC. Higher co-expression of MAP3K7 and mTOR was significantly associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Taken together, our results revealed that the MAP3K7-mTOR axis might promote tumorigenesis and malignancy, which provides a potential marker or therapeutic target for HCC patients.","publish_time":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Jin-Shiung; Tsai, Wei-Lun; Liu, Pei-Feng; Goan, Yih-Gang; Lin, Chih-Wen; Tseng, Ho-Hsing; Lee, Cheng-Hsin; Shu, Chih-Wen","journal":"Front Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a9a6baf1c4d04b23721c833ad956438f9d62e73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6558008.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6558008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCC patients","HCC malignancy","MAP3K7 expression","HCC cell proliferation","invasion of HCC cells","primary HCC cells","various HCC cell lines","mTOR expression","MAP3K7-mTOR axis","silencing MAP3K7","poor prognosis of HCC","Higher co-expression of MAP3K7","genetic ablation of MAP3K7","dysregulation of kinases","role of kinases","Stable knockdown of MAP3K7 attenuated tumor formation","spheroid cell culture model","expression of mammalian target of rapamycin","tumors of patients","kinome siRNA library screening","tumor xenograft mouse model","therapeutic target","various diseases","kinome small interfering RNA","cellular biological processes","phosphorylation","potential marker","pivotal roles","growth","migration","crucial gene","kinase-related genes","tumorigenesis","addition","hepatocellular carcinoma","lack of suitable targets","cancer","study","Targeted therapy","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy during Jun\u00EDn virus (JUNV) multiplication using human A549 cells. We found that JUNV infection induces an increment of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, an accumulation of punctate pattern in RFP-LC3-transfected cells and the colocalisation of viral nucleoprotein and LC3 protein, suggesting autophagosome formation. JUNV infection also induced the degradation of the autophagy receptor p62, suggesting that complete autophagic flux was triggered. In addition, we showed that inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine significantly reduces viral multiplication. Moreover, viral yield was increased when autophagy was induced using rapamycin. Furthermore, JUNV infection induced the colocalisation of p62, ATG16, RAB5, RAB7A and LAMP1 with the autophagosomal LC3 protein. That suggests that phagosomes undergo the maturation process during viral infection. Finally, we demonstrated that siRNA experiments targeting essential autophagy genes (ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin 1) reduce viral protein synthesis and viral yield. Overall, our results indicate that JUNV activates host autophagy machinery enhancing its multiplication.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez Vidakovics, Maria Laura A.; Ure, Agust\u00EDn E.; Arr\u00EDas, Paula N.; Romanowski, V\u00EDctor; G\u00F3mez, Ricardo M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b66c037ebfee8059dd47d2614cf5d55618d8260f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6583977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6583977/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JUNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","viral multiplication","JUNV infection","viral yield","inhibition of autophagy","role of autophagy","viral protein synthesis","autophagy receptor p62","colocalisation of viral nucleoprotein","RFP-LC3","essential autophagy genes","autophagosomal LC3 protein","host autophagy machinery","colocalisation of p62","transfected cells","cellular response","cellular homeostasis","maturation process","regulated degradative process","human A549 cells","ATG5","RAB7A","LAMP1","Beclin","ATG7","accumulation of punctate pattern","Jun\u00EDn virus","ATG16","RAB5","degradation","siRNA experiments","complete autophagic flux","bafilomycin A1","methyladenine","fundamental component","autophagosome formation","phagosomes","results","increment","addition","study","rapamycin"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigate the contribution of BspC, an antigen I/II family adhesin, to the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis. Disruption of the bspC gene reduced GBS adherence to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC), while heterologous expression of BspC in non-adherent Lactococcus lactis conferred bacterial attachment. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with \u0394bspC mutants exhibited lower mortality as well as decreased brain bacterial counts and inflammatory infiltrate compared to mice infected with WT GBS strains. Further, BspC was both necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine expression. We determined that BspC interacts with the host cytoskeleton component vimentin and confirmed this interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid assay, microscale thermophoresis, immunofluorescent staining, and imaging flow cytometry. Vimentin null mice were protected from WT GBS infection and also exhibited less inflammatory cytokine production in brain tissue.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study (Assessing Predictors of Infant RSV Effects and Severity, AsPIRES) was to identify factors associated with severe disease in full-term healthy infants younger than 10 months with primary RSV infection. METHODS: RSV infected infants were enrolled from 3 cohorts during consecutive winters from August 2012 to April 2016 in Rochester, New York. A birth cohort was prospectively enrolled and followed through their first winter for development of RSV infection. An outpatient supplemental cohort was enrolled in the emergency department or pediatric offices, and a hospital cohort was enrolled on admission with RSV infection. RSV was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and samples collected for assays: buccal swab (cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction, PCR), nasal swab (RSV qualitative PCR, complete viral gene sequence, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid [RNA] amplicon microbiota analysis), nasal wash (chemokine and cytokine assays), nasal brush (nasal respiratory epithelial cell gene expression using RNA sequencing [RNAseq]), and 2 to 3 ml of heparinized blood (flow cytometry, RNAseq analysis of purified cluster of differentiation [CD]4\u002B, CD8\u002B, B cells and natural killer cells, and RSV-specific antibody). Cord blood (RSV-specific antibody) was also collected for the birth cohort. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be used for analysis of data using a continuous Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) as the outcome variable. Novel statistical methods will be developed for integration of the large complex datasets. RESULTS: A total of 453 infants were enrolled into the 3 cohorts; 226 in the birth cohort, 60 in the supplemental cohort, and 78 in the hospital cohort. A total of 126 birth cohort infants remained in the study and were evaluated for 150 respiratory illnesses. Of the 60 RSV positive infants in the supplemental cohort, 42 completed the study, whereas all 78 of the RSV positive hospital cohort infants completed the study. A GRSS was calculated for each RSV-infected infant and is being used to analyze each of the complex datasets by correlation with disease severity in univariate and multivariate methods. CONCLUSIONS: The AsPIRES study will provide insights into the complex pathogenesis of RSV infection in healthy full-term infants with primary RSV infection.

Here, we report that interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. IL-4 receptor expression was detected in a variety of glial cells after ischemic brain injury, including oligodendrocyte lineage cells. IL-4 deficiency in knockout mice resulted in greater deterioration of white matter over 14 d after stroke. Consistent with these findings, intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke improved white matter integrity and attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in wild-type mice, as revealed by histological immunostaining, electron microscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology. The selective effect of IL-4 on remyelination was verified in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination. By leveraging primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia-depleted mice, and conditional OPC-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03B3) knockout mice, we discovered a direct salutary effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation that was mediated by the PPAR\u03B3 axis. Our findings reveal a new regenerative role of IL-4 in the central nervous system (CNS), which lies beyond its known immunoregulatory functions on microglia/macrophages or peripheral lymphocytes. Therefore, intranasal IL-4 delivery may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve white matter integrity in stroke and other brain injuries.","publish_time":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qingxiu; Zhu, Wen; Xu, Fei; Dai, Xuejiao; Shi, Ligen; Cai, Wei; Mu, Hongfeng; Hitchens, T.

The virus is tentatively named Hypsugopoxvirus (HYPV) after the bat species from which it was isolated. The nearly complete genome size is 166,600 nt and it encodes 161 genes. Genome analyses suggest that HYPV belongs to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, with the highest nucleotide identity (85%) to Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) detected from a microbat Eptesicus fuscus in WA, USA, in 2011.

Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is one of the major viral pathogens of human myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Because of its small genome, CVB depends on cellular machineries for productive replication. However, how the structural and non-structural components of CVB would manipulate cell cycle is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB type 3 (CVB3) induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. G1 arrest was the result of the decrease level of cyclin E and the accumulation of p27(Kip1). Study on the gene expression profile of the cells expressing VP1 showed that the expression of both heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1) and Hsp70-2 was significantly up-regulated. Knockdown of Hsp70 resulted in the increased level of cyclin E and the reduction of p27(Kip1). We further demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the heat shock factor 1, which directly promotes the expression of Hsp70, was also increased in the cell expressing VP1. Moreover, we show that CVB3 infection also induced G1 arrest, likely due to dysregulating Hsp70, cyclin E, and p27, while knockdown of Hsp70 dramatically inhibited viral replication. Cell cycle arrest at G1 phase facilitated CVB3 infection, since viral replication in the cells synchronized at G1 phase dramatically increased. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the VP1 of CVB3 induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase through up-regulating Hsp70. Our findings suggest that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB is capable of manipulating cellular activities during viral infection.","publish_time":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yao; Zhao, Shuoxuan; Chen, Yang; Wang, Tianying; Dong, Chaorun; Wo, Xiaoman; Zhang, Jian; Dong, Yanyan; Xu, Weizhen; Feng, Xiaofeng; Qu, Cong; Wang, Yan; Zhong, Zhaohua; Zhao, Wenran","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88c599b1de8a17cd519f9f72aaaea28392f697f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6653663.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6653663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G1 arrest","cell cycle arrest","G1 phase","expression of Hsp70","VP1 of CVB3","viral replication","Knockdown of Hsp70","viral infection","dysregulating Hsp70","CVB3 infection","capsid protein VP1 of CVB type","study","increased level of cyclin E","productive replication","non-structural components of CVB","heat shock protein","decrease level of cyclin E","cellular machineries","cellular activities","accumulation of p27","reduction of p27","cells","Kip1","major viral pathogens of human myocarditis","favorable cellular environment","gene expression profile","heat shock factor","viruses","result","cardiomyopathy","common strategies","small genome","phosphorylation","findings","Coxsackievirus B"],"language":"en"},

Dysregulation of the antibody response can lead to an autoimmune disease, malignancy, or enhanced infection. Since the experimental delineation of a distinct B cell lineage in 1965, various methods have been developed to understand antigen-specific B cell responses in the context of autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, infection, and vaccination. In this review, we summarize the established techniques and discuss new and emerging technologies for probing the B cell response in vitro and in vivo by taking advantage of the specificity of B cell receptor (BCR)-associated and secreted antibodies. These include ELISPOT, flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy to identify and/or isolate primary antigen-specific B cells. We also present our approach to identify rare antigen-specific B cells using magnetic enrichment followed by flow cytometry. Once these cells are isolated, in vitro proliferation assays and adoptive transfer experiments in mice can be used to further characterize antigen-specific B cell activation, function, and fate. Transgenic mouse models of B cells targeting model antigens and of B cell signaling have also significantly advanced our understanding of antigen-specific B cell responses in vivo.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Taylor, Justin J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee632fa425607e8ff91fc3730bc0782d43ce9c0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6667631.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6667631/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transgenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigen-specific B cell responses","antigen-specific B cell activation","primary antigen-specific B cells","rare antigen-specific B cells","distinct B cell lineage","specificity of B cell receptor","Transgenic mouse models of B cells","primary infection","understanding of antigen","flow cytometry","mass cytometry","primary immunodeficiencies","enhanced infection","antibody response","overall immune response","model antigens","foreign antigens","secreted antibodies","context of autoimmune diseases","proliferation assays","critical component","magnetic enrichment","emerging technologies","BCR","adoptive transfer experiments","pathogen clearance","function","established techniques","experimental delineation","mice","malignancy","ELISPOT","various methods","advantage","fluorescence microscopy","fate","vaccination","approach","subsequent infections","review","Dysregulation"],"language":"en"},

In rare cases they can lead to sepsis, which may pose a vital threat to the patient. The purpose of this study was to analyse characteristics concerning etiology and progress of severe odontogenic infections with a fulminant development. METHODS: All patients with odontogenic infections requiring hospital admission were included in a retrospective analysis conducted from 02/2012 to 09/2017. Of 483 patients 16 patients (13 male, 3 female) showed severe exacerbation with septic progress. The average age was 52.8 years. All patients underwent at least one surgical procedure that involved an extraoral incision and drainage as well as high volume irrigation intraoperatively. At least one revision was required for four of the patients. Three patients showed an exceedingly severe disease progression with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the results of an antibiogram and resistogram. Irrigation with saline was done several times a day. RESULTS: Sixteen patients showed odontogenic infections that spread over multiple maxillo-facial and cervical regions accompanied by septic laboratory signs. All these patients needed intensive care and a tracheostomy. The hospitalization period was 27.8 days on average. In 16 cases risk factors for the development of odontogenic abscesses like diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism and poor oral hygiene were present. Intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria, especially anaerobes and streptococci, mainly Streptocococcus viridans. CONCLUSION: Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated based on clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision and drainage including elimination of odontogenic foci as well as intensified intra- and postoperative irrigation. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance. A combination of tazobactam and piperacillin has proven to be a good first choice and can be recommended for abscesses that spread over multiple levels with initial signs of severe infections.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weise, H.; Naros, A.; Weise, C.; Reinert, S.; Hoefert, S.","journal":"BMC Oral Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18714de3aeea8c0a5eb275a3d808769179f92e90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679486.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Odontogenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","progress of severe odontogenic infections","odontogenic origin","development of odontogenic abscesses","initial signs of severe infections","elimination of odontogenic foci","severe exacerbation","exceedingly severe disease progression","drainage","immediate surgical incision","fulminant progression","fulminant development","septic progress","antibiogram","Immediate antibiotic treatment","results","postoperative irrigation","septic laboratory signs","high volume irrigation","multiple levels","extraoral incision","surgical procedure","imaging data","average age","rare cases","poor oral hygiene","multiple maxillo-facial","cases risk factors","anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria","rheumatism","obesity","multiorgan dysfunction syndrome","nicotine abuse","chronic alcohol","typical polymicrobial aerobic","cervical regions","diabetes mellitus","anaerobes","MODS","etiology","hospital admission","streptococci","Intraoperative swabs","characteristics","CONCLUSION","male","circulatory arrest","piperacillin","study","Streptocococcus viridans","sepsis","hospitalization period","days","saline","times","head","neck region","intensive care","tracheostomy","METHODS","vital threat","retrospective analysis","combination of tazobactam","years","utmost importance","choice","resistogram","purpose","incisions","BACKGROUND","revision"],"language":"en"},

Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species\u2019 fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide- and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants\u2019 feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission. The findings point out the occurrence and fecal shedding of previously unknown AstV in sheep and goats and pave the way towards a better understanding of the diversity and transmission of AstV in small ruminants.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kauer, Ronja V.; Koch, Michel C.; Hierweger, Melanie M.; Werder, Simea; Boujon, C\u00E9line L.; Seuberlich, Torsten","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d304a9fd7873449676f289294df478dcbc7b53d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679648/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unknown AstV","various AstV","bovine AstV","identification of AstV","different neurotropic AstV","excretion of neurotropic AstV","potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV","potential interspecies transmission of AstV","feces samples","ruminant species\u2019 fecal samples","Positive tested samples","humans","human stool samples","plausible interspecies transmission","small ruminants\u2019 feces","fecal shedding","different ruminant species","encephalitis","discovery of multiple","goats","recombination analysis","Switzerland","sheep","aims","mammals","RNA extraction","prediction of multiple recombination events","positive-sense RNA viruses","generated sequences","full-length genome sequences","high genetic similarity","novel genotype-species","diverse new genetic variants","gastrointestinal tract","virus properties","amino acid databases","nucleotide","diversity","certain conditions","phylogenetic analyses","infection spreads","brain","better understanding","way","patients","classification","investigation","hypothesis","examination","associations","relevance","RT-PCR","similar pathogenesis","cattle","generation sequencing","gastroenteritis","immunosuppression","study","diarrhea","findings","work","Astroviruses"],"language":"en"},

However, factors driving heterogeneous B cell subset accumulation and antibody (Ab) production in the CNS compartment, including the contribution of ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELF), during chronic CNS inflammation remain unclear and is a major gap in our understanding of neuroinflammation. We sought to address this gap using the Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) model of progressive MS. In this model, injection of the virus into susceptible mouse strains results in a persistent infection associated with demyelination and progressive disability. During chronic infection, the predominant B cell phenotypes accumulating in the CNS were isotype-switched B cells, including Bmem and ASC with na\u00EFve/early activated and transitional B cells present at low frequencies. B cell accumulation in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD coincided with intrathecal Ab synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mature and isotype-switched B cells predominately localized to the meninges and perivascular space, with IgG isotype-switched B cells frequently accumulating in the parenchymal space. Both mature and isotype-switched B cells and T cells occupied meningeal and perivascular spaces, with minimal evidence for spatial organization typical of ELF mimicking secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). Moreover, immunohistological analysis of immune cell aggregates revealed a lack of SLO-like ELF features, such as cell proliferation, cell death, and germinal center B cell markers. Nonetheless, flow cytometric assessment of B cells within the CNS showed enhanced expression of activation markers, including moderate upregulation of GL7 and expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80. B cell-related chemokines and trophic factors, including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL19, and CXCL13, were elevated in the CNS. These results indicate that localization of heterogeneous B cell populations, including activated and isotype-switched B cell phenotypes, to the CNS and intrathecal Ab (ItAb) synthesis can occur independently of SLO-like follicles during chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiSano, Krista D.; Royce, Darlene B.; Gilli, Francesca; Pachner, Andrew R.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c513fb0abb1aa50c3323e4f6d311248701f0280b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6687912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiple Sclerosis","CNS","ASC","ELF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cell accumulation","transitional B cells","memory B cells","predominant B cell phenotypes","B cell-related chemokines","cytometric assessment of B cells","heterogeneous B cell subset accumulation","accumulation of various B cell subsets","cell death","cell proliferation","germinal center B cell markers","localization of heterogeneous B cell populations","chronic CNS inflammation","T cells","CNS compartment","antibody secreting cells","chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease","immunohistological analysis of immune cell aggregates","chronic TMEV-IDD","chronic infections","IgG isotype","intrathecal Ab synthesis","ELF features","inflammatory demyelinating diseases","persistent infection","Bmem","lack of SLO","model of progressive","spatial organization typical of ELF","enhanced expression of activation markers","perivascular spaces","susceptible mouse strains results","contribution of ectopic lymphoid follicles","trophic factors","major gap","progressive disability","parenchymal space","secondary lymphoid organs","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","Persistent central nervous system","minimal evidence","Multiple Sclerosis","moderate upregulation of GL7","injection","MS","cerebrospinal fluid","production","meninges","demyelination","low frequencies","ItAb","costimulatory molecule CD80","CXCL10","CCL19","understanding of neuroinflammation","CSF","CXCL13","CXCL9"],"language":"en"},

The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 \u00B5M morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times), LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times) expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases. Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation.

Emerging concepts in nucleolar biology include the nucleolar stress response (NSR), whereby a series of cell insults have a special impact on the nucleolus. These insults include, among others, ultra-violet radiation (UV), nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and thermal stress. While these stresses might influence nucleolar biology directly or indirectly, other perturbances whose origin resides in the nucleolar biology also trigger nucleolar and systemic stress responses. Among the latter, we find mutations in nucleolar and ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing inhibitors and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription inhibition. The p53 protein also mediates NSR, leading ultimately to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence or differentiation. Hence, NSR is gaining importance in cancer biology. The nucleolar size and ribosome biogenesis, and how they connect with the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway, are also becoming important in the biology of aging and cancer.

We found that high dose 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) supplementation could ease intestinal injury and inhibit intestinal immune response induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), suggesting that feeding a high dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) could be used as an approach against PEDV infection. ABSTRACT: We conducted this experiment to determine if feeding 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) to weaned pigs would alleviate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and immune response. Forty-two weaned pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary 25(OH)D(3) treatments (5.5, 5.5, 43.0, 80.5, 118.0, 155.5 \u03BCg 25(OH)D(3)/kg diet) for 26 days. On day 22 of the trial, all the treatments were orally administrated with PEDV except for one of the 5.5 \u03BCg 25(OH)D(3)/kg treatments, which was challenged with the same volume of sterile saline and served as control. Another 5.5 \u03BCg 25(OH)D(3)/kg group for PEDV challenge was named CON-PEDV. Average daily gain (p \u003C 0.05) was reduced by PEDV infection. PEDV administration also induced severe diarrhea (p \u003C 0.05), reduction of villous height and the ratio of villous height to crypt depth, and increase of crypt depth and serum diamine oxidase activity (p \u003C 0.05). Serum IgM and complement component 4 levels were increased by PEDV challenge. However, 155.5 \u03BCg 25(OH)D(3)/kg supplementation alleviated intestinal damage (p \u003C 0.05) compared with CON-PEDV. Furthermore, 155.5 \u03BCg 25(OH)D(3)/kg supplementation downregulated the mRNA abundance of inflammatory cytokines and interferon signal pathway-related genes (p \u003C 0.05) compared with CON-PEDV. These results suggested that dietary supplementation of 155.5 \u03BCg 25(OH)D(3)/kg could alleviate intestinal damage and protect against PEDV-induced inflammatory status.","publish_time":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Jiwen; Tian, Gang; Chen, Daiwen; Zheng, Ping; Yu, Jie; Mao, Xiangbing; He, Jun; Luo, Yuheng; Luo, Junqiu; Huang, Zhiqing; Wu, Aimin; Yu, Bing","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1c0ce2d5b6132eb41c6c7339b211655c8460e1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6770734.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OH","PEDV infection","PEDV challenge","hydroxyvitamin D","PEDV administration","\u03BCg","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","intestinal damage","dietary supplementation","treatments","intestinal immune response","severe diarrhea","intestinal injury","crypt depth","high dose","weaned pigs","ratio of villous height","reduction of villous height","Serum IgM","inflammatory status","mRNA abundance of inflammatory cytokines","serum diamine oxidase activity","interferon signal pathway-related genes","effective measures","current swine husbandry","major problems","levels","prevention","component","SIMPLE SUMMARY","Average daily gain","group","volume of sterile saline","control","trial","results","approach","ABSTRACT","experiment","days"],"language":"en"},

Recently, we developed a novel single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) nano-structure adjuvant, which can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses. In this study, we evaluated the safety and toxicological profiles of this ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in vitro and in vivo. Mice were intramuscularly immunized with the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant three times, once every 2 weeks. The results indicate no significant differences in hematological and serum biochemistry parameters between the ssRNA-treated groups and the control group. From a histopathological perspective, no evidence of tissue damage was found in any group. The levels of IgE and anti-nuclear antibodies, which are markers of autoimmune disease, were not different between the ssRNA-treated groups and the control group.

No vaccines are available for human use and those licensed for veterinary use have potential drawbacks, including residual virulence that may contraindicate their use in pregnancy.

ChAdOx1 RVF is fully protective against RVF in non-pregnant livestock and is also under development for human use. Here, we now demonstrate that when administered to pregnant sheep and goats, ChAdOx1 RVF is safe, elicits high titre RVFV neutralizing antibody, and provides protection against viraemia and foetal loss, although this protection is not as robust for the goats. In addition, we provide a description of RVFV challenge in pregnant goats and contrast this to the pathology observed in pregnant sheep.

Bovine RSV (BRSV) is a primary cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young cattle. The calf model of BRSV infection is useful to understand the immune response to human RSV infection. We have previously developed an amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccine (i.e., nanovaccine) encapsulating the fusion and attachment proteins from BRSV (BRSV-NP).

Our results show that VAD calves are unable to respond to the mucosal BRSV-NP vaccine, are afforded no protection from BRSV challenge and have significant abnormalities in the inflammatory response in the infected lung. We further show that acute BRSV infection negatively impacts serum and liver retinol, rendering even well-nourished individuals susceptible to VAD.

The viral infections have been reported in more than 1700 humans, ranging from asymptomatic or mild cases to severe pneumonia with a mortality rate of 40%. It is well documented now that dromedary camels contract the infection and shed the virus without notable symptoms, and such animals had been infected by at least the early 1980s. The mechanism of camel to human transmission is still not clear, but several primary cases have been associated with camel contact. There is no approved antiviral drug or vaccine against MERS\u2010CoV despite the active research in this area. Vaccine candidates have been developed using various platforms and regimens and have been tested in several animal models. Here, this article reviews the published studies on MERS\u2010CoV vaccines with more focus on vaccines tested in large animals, including camels. It is foreseeable that the 1\u2010health approach could be the best way of tackling the MERS\u2010CoV endemic in the Arabian Peninsula, by using the mass vaccination of camels in the affected areas to block camel to human transmission. Camel vaccines can be developed in a faster time with fewer regulations and lower costs and could clear this virus from the Arabian Peninsula if accompanied by efficient public health measures.","publish_time":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alharbi, Naif Khalaf","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3382972f793a12e7f7a6e1e5d48d4795b3d21f85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27786402/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1917","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Arabian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["MERS","CoV vaccines","Camel vaccines","CoV endemic","mechanism of camel","camel contact","Arabian Peninsula","human transmission","dromedary camels","mass vaccination of camels","mild cases","health approach","primary cases","Vaccine candidates","large animals","efficient public health measures","severe pneumonia","affected areas","focus","lower costs","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","fewer regulations","faster time","published studies","best way","approved antiviral drug","active research","various platforms","mortality rate","notable symptoms","article","novel betacoronavirus","Saudi Arabia","regimens","humans","viral infections","animal models"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of educational intervention on the knowledge of hospital pharmacists about ADRs. METHODS: This was a 3-month randomized controlled trial conducted in Saudi Arabia between January 2018 and March 2018. Participants in both groups were required to complete an online questionnaire at baseline and at 12-week follow-up. Participants in the intervention group received a structured information sheet about ADRs 2 weeks after the first assessment. The main outcome measure was difference in mean knowledge score about ADRs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in mean knowledge score about ADRs. RESULTS: A total of 46 participants were included in the study. At the 12-week follow-up, there was a significant improvement in the mean knowledge score (\u00B1 standard deviation) of intervention participants from 7.67 (\u00B1 2.1) at baseline to 11.22 (\u00B1 0.4) (95% CI \u22124.5 to \u22122.5; p \u003C 0.0001). The mean knowledge score of control participants remained unchanged at 6.71 (\u00B1 2.3) during both baseline and follow-up assessments. CONCLUSION: ADR-specific education was associated with a significant improvement in the knowledge and understanding of pharmacists about ADRs and their methods of reporting.

However, because viral proteins evolve very fast, commonly used sequence similarity detection methods such as BLAST may overlook homologs. We analyzed a data set of proteins from RNA viruses characterized as \u201Cgenus specific\u201D by BLAST. More powerful methods developed recently, such as HHblits or HHpred (available through web-based, user-friendly interfaces), could detect distant homologs of a quarter of these proteins, suggesting that these methods should be used to annotate viral genomes. In-depth manual analyses of a subset of the remaining sequences, guided by contextual information such as taxonomy, gene order, or domain cooccurrence, identified distant homologs of another third. Thus, a combination of powerful automated methods and manual analyses can uncover distant homologs of many proteins thought to be orphans. We expect these methodological results to be also applicable to cellular organisms, since they generally evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses. As an application, we reanalyzed the genome of a bee pathogen, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). We could identify homologs of most of its proteins thought to be orphans; in each case, identifying homologs provided functional clues. We discovered that CBPV encodes a domain homologous to the Alphavirus methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase; a putative membrane protein, SP24, with homologs in unrelated insect viruses and insect-transmitted plant viruses having different morphologies (cileviruses, higreviruses, blunerviruses, negeviruses); and a putative virion glycoprotein, ORF2, also found in negeviruses. SP24 and ORF2 are probably major structural components of the virions.","publish_time":"2014-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuchibhatla, Durga B.; Sherman, Westley A.; Chung, Betty Y.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the RV types detected with respiratory illness episodes in infants in Nepal. STUDY METHODS: Infants born to women enrolled in a randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization in rural, southern Nepal were followed with household\u2010based weekly surveillance until 180 days of age. Infants with respiratory symptoms had nasal swabs tested for twelve respiratory viruses. A subset with RV alone was selected for sequencing of the VP4/2 gene to identify RV types. RESULTS: Among 547 RV\u2010only positive illnesses detected from December 2012 to April 2014, 285 samples (52%) were sequenced. RV\u2010A, B, and C species were detected in 193 (68%), 18 (6%), and 74 (26%) specimens, respectively. A total of 94 unique types were identified from the sequenced samples, including 52 RV\u2010A, 11 RV\u2010B, and 31 RV\u2010C. Multiple species and types circulated simultaneously throughout the study period. No seasonality was observed. The median ages at illness onset were 88, 104, and 88 days for RV\u2010A, B, and C, respectively. The median polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values did not differ between RV species. No differences between RV species were observed for reported respiratory symptoms, including pneumonia, or for medical care\u2010seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Among very young, symptomatic infants in rural Nepal, all three species and many types of RV were identified; RV\u2010A was detected most frequently. There was no association between RV species and disease severity.","publish_time":"2019-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuypers, Jane; Perchetti, Garrett A.; Chu, Helen Y.; Newman, Kira L.; Katz, Joanne; Khatry, Subarna K.; LeClerq, Steven C.; Jerome, Keith R.; Tielsch, James M.; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/388280d5ebdb61d0a58fc34497aa361161f7c651.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6800797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389049/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV species","RV types","types of RV","C species","respiratory symptoms","Multiple species","respiratory viruses","symptomatic infants","unique types","respiratory illness episodes","rural Nepal","southern Nepal","sequenced samples","common causes of acute respiratory infections","young children","illness onset","median ages","days of age","STUDY METHODS","study period","median polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values","randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization","nasal swabs","women","RVs","weekly surveillance","household","pneumonia","gene","association","disease severity","sequencing","VP4","PROBLEM","Rhinoviruses","medical care","CONCLUSIONS","total","positive illnesses","OBJECTIVE","differences","subset","RESULTS","specimens","seasonality"],"language":"en"},

Hence, identification of SES zones in thirty-eight sub-basins (SB) for basin prioritization is necessary. The present research addressed the issue by using four multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models: VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighing (SAW), compound factor (CF). To determine the best fitted method from MCDM for erosion susceptibility (ES), a comparison has been made with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), where fifteen morphometric parameters were considered for MCDM, and meteorological data, soil, slope and land use land cover (LULC) were considered for SWAT model. Two validation indices of percentage change and intensity change were used for evaluation and comparison of MCDM results. With SWAT model performance, SWAT calibration and uncertainty analysis programs (CUP) was used for sensitive analysis of SWAT parameters on flow discharge and sediment load simulation. The results showed that 23, 16, 18 SB have high ES; therefore they were given 1 to 3 ranks, whereas 31, 37, 21SB have low ES, hence given 38 to 36 rank as predicted by MCDM methods and SWAT. MCDM validation results depict that VIKOR and CF methods are more acceptable than TOPSIS and SAW. Calibration (flow discharge R2 0.86, NSE 0.75; sediment load R2 0.87, NSE 0.69) and validation (flow discharge R2 0.79, NSE 0.55; sediment load R2 0.79, NSE 0.76) of SWAT model indicated that simulated results are well fitted with observed data. Therefore, VIKOR reflects the significant role of morphometric parameters on ES, whereas SWAT reflects the significant role of LULC, slope, and soil on ES. However, it could be concluded that VIKOR is more effective MCDM method in comparison to SWAT prediction.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattacharya, Raj Kumar; Chatterjee, Nilanjana Das; Das, Kousik","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04bfbd5edb5bf33e64dd26cc759c2ae72b414d2d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425254/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720329910?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139474; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720329910","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kompromisno Resenje"],"organizations":["SES","CF","Water Assessment Tool","LULC","SWAT","MCDM","NSE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SWAT calibration","SWAT prediction","MCDM validation results","comparison of MCDM results","MCDM methods","SWAT model performance","NSE","VIKOR","sensitive analysis of SWAT parameters","flow discharge R2","effective MCDM method","sediment load R2","SB","high ES","low ES","simulated results","soil fertility deterioration","sediment load simulation","significant role of morphometric parameters","multiple problems of soil erosion susceptibility","slope","TOPSIS","significant role of LULC","CF methods","SAW","validation indices of percentage change","best fitted method","land use land cover","intensity change","basin prioritization","meteorological data","observed data","uncertainty analysis programs","Abstract Kangsabati basin","identification of SES zones","models","tropical plateau region","ideal solution","VlseKriterijumska optimizacija","similarity","technique","order preference","simple additive weighing","Kompromisno Resenje","CUP","sub-basins","multi-criteria decision-making","issue","evaluation","compound factor","sedimentation","Water Assessment Tool","reservoirs","present research","ranks"],"language":"en"},

Three pairs of primers were designed based on conserved regions in the genomic sequences of the three viruses and were used to specifically amplify targeted fragments of 237 bp from the VP2 gene of FPV, 465 bp from the NP1 gene of FBoV and 645 bp from the RdRp gene of FeAstV. The results showed that this mPCR assay was effective, because it could detect at least 2.25-4.04 \u00D7 10(4) copies of genomic DNA of the three viruses per \u03BCl, was highly specific, and had a good broad-spectrum ability to detect different genotypes of the targeted viruses. A total of 197 faecal samples that had been screened previously for FeAstV and FBoV were collected from domestic cats in northeast China and were tested for the three viruses using the newly developed mPCR assay. The total positive rate for these three viruses was 59.89% (118/197). From these samples, DNA from FPV, FBoV and FeAstV was detected in 73, 51 and 46 faecal samples, respectively. The mPCR testing results agreed with the routine PCR results with a coincidence rate of 100%. The results of this study show that this mPCR assay can simultaneously detect and differentiate FPV, FBoV and FeAstV and can be used as an easy, specific and efficient detection tool for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigation of these three viruses.

The recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new H17N10 subtype in Central American fruit bats suggests that other New World species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses. Using consensus degenerate RT-PCR, we identified a novel influenza A virus, designated as H18N11, in a flat-faced fruit bat (Artibeus planirostris) from Peru. Serologic studies with the recombinant H18 protein indicated that several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined, indicative of a long-standing host-virus association. Structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a unique mode of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells.

We recently introduced a single equation model (the incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA model) that can be used for short-term epidemiological forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell-shaped curve. He noticed that this time-evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula (\u201CFarr\u0027s law\u201D) that could be used for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the IDEA model follows Farr\u0027s law, and show that for intuitive assumptions, Farr\u0027s Law can be derived from the IDEA model. Moreover, we show that both mathematical approaches, Farr\u0027s Law and the IDEA model, resemble solutions of a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental differential-equation model in an asymptotic limit, where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures, and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals. This suggests that the concept of the reproduction number [Formula: see text] was implicitly captured in Farr\u0027s (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests that control of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission.","publish_time":"2018-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santillana, Mauricio; Tuite, Ashleigh; Nasserie, Tahmina; Fine, Paul; Champredon, David; Chindelevitch, Leonid; Dushoff, Jonathan; Fisman, David","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5bb210c5ddf204ac14ed8e23bffca9c202123de5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6326218.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042718300101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839910/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2018.03.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042718300101","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["William Farr"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IDEA model","Farr\u0027s law","single equation model","single mathematical formula","compartmental differential-equation model","control of epidemics","mathematical approaches","Mathematical models","epidemic forecasting","changes of disease transmission","simple mathematical expressions","dynamics of disease transmission","susceptible-infectious","epidemic events","century","analysis of infectious disease outbreaks","natural history of epidemics","projection of epidemic trajectories","control measures","depletion of susceptible individuals","time-evolution behavior","short-term epidemiological forecasting","incidence decay","description","use","SIR","William Farr","exponential adjustment","work","asymptotic limit","recent innovations","reproduction number","observation","pre-microbial era","text","solutions","intuitive assumptions","concept","intervention","symmetrical pattern","bell-shaped curve"],"language":"en"},

Down-regulation of microRNA-9 inhibited the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines, promoted the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and induced the remission of organ damage, showing a protective effect in inflammation.

Myeloid specific sirt1 knockout mice were included and we found that lack of SIRT1 in mice macrophages led to aggravated inflammation, cell apoptosis and organ injury, and eliminated the protective property of microRNA-9 inhibitor.

The lower limit of detection of PCV using the miniarray was 10(1.9) tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID(50))/ml and 10(2.08)TCID(50)/ml for PCV1 and PCV2, respectively, and 100 viral copies/\u03BCl for both PCV1 and PCV2.

Of the 141 samples evaluated, 55 were identified as positive for PCV by the miniarray. Relative to in situ hybridization, the sensitivity and specificity of the miniarray was 100% and 98.9%, respectively. In contrast to other microarray systems, the miniarray does not require a DNA chip reader, since the results can be determined by visual inspection of colorized spots on a nylon membrane.

The tertiary structure of RNA molecules and RNA\u2013RNA/protein interaction sites are of increasing importance as potential targets for new medicines that treat a broad array of human diseases. Current RNA drugs are split into two groups: antisense RNA molecules and aptamers. In this report, we present a novel workflow to predict RNA tertiary structures and RNA\u2013RNA/protein interactions using the KNIME environment, which enabled us to assemble a combination of RNA-related analytical tools and databases. In this study, three analytical workflows for comprehensive structural analysis of RNA are introduced: (1) prediction of the tertiary structure of RNA; (2) prediction of the structure of RNA\u2013RNA complexes and analysis of their interactions; and (3) prediction of the structure of RNA\u2013protein complexes and analysis of their interactions. In an RNA\u2013protein case study, we modeled the tertiary structure of pegaptanib, an aptamer drug, and performed docking calculations of the pegaptanib-vascular endothelial growth factor complex using a fragment of the interaction site of the aptamer. We also present molecular dynamics simulations of the RNA\u2013protein complex to evaluate the affinity of the complex by mutating bases at the interaction interface. The results provide valuable information for designing novel features of aptamer-protein complexes.

Summary Dehydration in infant under the age of one year, even more under six months old, due to viral diarrhoea in most cases, is particularly risky. Management of dehydration consists in rehydrating and maintaining nutritional needs. The key to choosing the right treatment is to assess dehydration gravity according to weight loss, expressed in percentages of body weight before dehydration, which can be tough or impossible to obtain. So, clinical signs like impairment of general aspect, lengthening of cutaneous recoloration time, persistent cutaneous crease, hollow eyes, mucous membranes dryness or tear lack, with tachycardia, arterial pressure and diuresis, can help in diagnosing dehydration gravity. Treatment is based on correcting extracellular area deficit. In severe cases, it is possible to treat with 20ml/kg of isotonic cristalloide solute intravenously (dehydration greater than 10%). In all other cases, the technique mostly used is oral rehydration, aimed for correcting hydrical deficit in four hours, which has proved to be efficient, secure and fast. It consists in using rehydration solutes fitting specific criteria. Using them precociously allows most efficient prevention of acute forms.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hubert, P.","journal":"Journal de P\u00E9diatrie et de Pu\u00E9riculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c2906334af01e37163582a981b3e882ed1601fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146766.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0987798308000558; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0987798308000558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dehydration consists in rehydrating","In severe cases","s\u00E9v\u00E9rit\u00E9 de la d\u00E9shydratation","to viral diarrhoea in most cases","expressed in percentages","can help in diagnosing dehydration gravity","\u00E9pisode de d\u00E9shydratation","d\u00E9shydratation sup\u00E9rieure","Summary Dehydration in infant under the age","treatment is to assess dehydration gravity according to weight loss","The key to choosing the","proved to be efficient","it is possible to treat with","Treatment is based","correcting hydrical deficit in four hours","dehydration greater than","haut risque de d\u00E9shydratation","body weight before dehydration","which can be tough or impossible to obtain","is particularly risky","It consists in using rehydration solutes fitting specific criteria","the technique mostly used is oral rehydration","other cases","correction rapide","correction de celle","cutaneous recoloration time","general aspect","cutaneous crease","correcting extracellular area deficit","with tachycardia","aspect g\u00E9n\u00E9ral","technique de choix","voie intraveineuse","recoloration cutan\u00E9e","voie orale","perte de poids","d\u00E9ficit hydrique","\u00E9valuation de la s\u00E9v\u00E9rit\u00E9","Using them precociously allows most efficient prevention","even more under","pourcentage du poids corporel","d\u00E9ficit du secteur extracellulaire","solut\u00E9s de r\u00E9hydratation adapt\u00E9s","aimed","mucous membranes dryness","year","months old","diuresis","tear lack","hollow eyes","arterial","lengthening","clinical signs like impairment","yeux creux","constatation","isotonic cristalloide solute intravenously","maintaining nutritional needs","allongement du temps","acute forms","pli cutan\u00E9 persistant","pr\u00E9vention","alt\u00E9ration","solut\u00E9 cristallo\u00EFde isotonique administr\u00E9","secure","absence de larmes","s\u00E9cheresse des muqueuses","premi\u00E8re cause","tachycardie","principaux \u00E9l\u00E9ments","phase initiale","heures","fast","Management","formes graves","\u00E9l\u00E9ment cl\u00E9","maintien des besoins hydriques","signes cliniques tels","pression art\u00E9rielle","diur\u00E8se","s\u00FBre","m\u00E9thode de r\u00E9f\u00E9rence","mois","charge","crit\u00E8res sp\u00E9cifiques","utilisation pr\u00E9coce","nourrisson","th\u00E9rapeutique","diarrh\u00E9e","traitement","prise","origine virale","expansion vol\u00E9mique","R\u00E9sum\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

This is particularly important for studies on the development of the adaptive immune response of neonates. Studies on laboratory rodents or primates have been ambiguous because neither the effect of environmental nor maternal factors on the newborn can be controlled in mammals that: (i) transmit potential maternal immunoregulatory factors in utero and (ii) are altricial and cannot be reared after birth without their mothers. Employing the newborn piglet model can address each of these concerns. However, it comes at the price of having first to characterize the immune system of swine and its development. This review focuses on the porcine B cell system, especially on the methods used for its characterization in fetal studies and neonatal piglets. Understanding these procedures is important in the interpretation of the data obtained. Studies on neonatal piglets have (a) provided valuable information on the development of the adaptive immune system, (b) lead to important advances in evolutionary biology, (c) aided our understanding of passive immunity and (d) provided opportunities to use swine to address specific issues in veterinary and biomedical research and immunotherapy.

In this review, we integrate new knowledge about exosomes from outside the field of nephrology with recent progress by renal researchers in order to provide a basis for speculation about how the study of exosomes may impact the fields of nephrology and renal physiology in the next few years.","publish_time":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Balkom, Bas W.M.; Pisitkun, Trairak; Verhaar, Marianne C.; Knepper, Mark A.","journal":"Kidney International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5958e21623316aeba99db79273c3149791ff6447.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5683a5ba8566c4b39ec778d3f97f9609e0c33246.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3412193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21881557/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815549788; https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.2011.292; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253815549788; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3412193?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of exosomes","mRNAs","miRNAs","renal researchers","field of nephrology","fields of nephrology","renal physiology","rich source of potential biomarker molecules","exosome-mediated transfer of proteins","extracellular space","order","recent progress","nm membrane vesicles","body fluids","cells of origin","numerous cell types","basis","diagnostic uses","physiological state","speculation","new knowledge","urine","plasma","structures","review","years","therapeutic purposes","promise"],"language":"en"},

This can cause structural changes that result in downstream functional effects, for example, in integrin activation. Recent studies have shown that a wide range of membrane proteins have labile disulfide bonds including CD132, the common gamma chain of the receptors for several cytokines including interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 (IL-2 and IL-4). The Cys(183)\u2013Cys(232) disulfide bond in mouse CD132 is susceptible to reduction by enzymes such as thioredoxin (TRX), gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiolreductase and protein disulfide isomerase, which are commonly secreted during immune activation. The Cys(183)\u2013Cys(232) disulfide bond is also reduced in an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute model of inflammation. Conditions that lead to the reduction of the Cys(183)\u2013Cys(232) disulfide bond in CD132 inhibit proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell clone and concomitant inhibition of the STAT-5 signalling pathway. The same reducing conditions had no effect on the proliferation of an IL-2-independent T cell clone, nor did they reduce disulfide bonds in IL-2 itself. We postulate that reduction of the Cys(183)\u2013Cys(232) disulfide in CD132 inhibits IL-2 binding to the receptor complex. Published data show that the Cys(183)\u2013Cys(232) disulfide bond is exposed at the surface of CD132 and in close contact with IL-2 and IL-4 in their respective receptor complexes. In addition, mutants in these Cys residues in human CD132 lead to immunodeficiency and loss of IL-2 binding. These results have wider implications for the regulation of cytokine receptors in general, as their activity can be modulated by a \u2018redox regulator\u2019 mechanism caused by the changes in the redox environment that occur during inflammation and activation of the immune system.","publish_time":"2012-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metcalfe, Clive; Cresswell, Peter; Barclay, A.

OAS1 polymorphisms have been associated with increased susceptibility to various diseases. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in OAS1 with tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: A total of 1215 TB cases and 1114 healthy controls were enrolled from two independent studies. Genotyping was conducted using the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction (iMLDR) method. Associations between OAS1 polymorphisms (rs2240190, rs1131454, 10,774,671 and 11,066,453) and TB risk were established based on distributions of allelic frequencies using different genetic models. RESULTS: Significant association was observed between rs10774671, rs1131454 and TB. In the initial study, the G allele of rs10774671 was a significantly protective factor against TB (P = 0.006) and the genotype of GG differed significantly between TB patients and controls under the codominant model (P = 0.008) after Bonferroni correction. In the validation study, we also observed that the rs10774671 G allele (P = 0.001) and GG genotype (P = 0.001) were associated with TB. In addition, we found that the rs1131454 G allele (P = 0.004) and GG genotype (P = 0.001) were protective against TB in the Chinese Han population. CONCLUSIONS: We report novel associations of polymorphisms in OAS1 with TB in the Chinese Tibetan and Han populations. Similar studies in different populations and functional studies are warranted to confirm our results.","publish_time":"2018-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Shouquan; Wang, Yu; Chen, Guo; Zhang, Miaomiao; Wang, Minggui; He, Jian-Qing","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c5491d07d2c4e996988e591b870ed272d2f944e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6267069.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30497421/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-018-0746-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bonferroni"],"organizations":["GG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB patients","TB cases","TB risk","OAS1 polymorphisms","association of polymorphisms","G allele of rs10774671","rs10774671 G allele","rs1131454 G allele","genotype of GG","GG genotype","novel associations of polymorphisms","different populations","functional studies","Similar studies","Han populations","independent studies","RESULTS","Chinese Han population","healthy controls","protective factor","Significant association","initial study","validation study","different genetic models","distributions of allelic frequencies","improved multiplex ligase detection reaction","iMLDR","important role","increased susceptibility","codominant model","inflammatory immune reactions","rs2240190","tuberculosis","various diseases","total","Genotyping","CONCLUSIONS","Oligoadenylate synthetase","Bonferroni correction","METHODS","addition","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The classification of wheeze in preschool children is more difficult compared to school aged children. It is based on the onset and duration of symptoms and divided children in three categories: transient early wheezing, non-atopic wheezing and atopic wheezing/asthma.

The aim of management of wheezing is to finalize the control of symptoms, reduce exacerbations and improve the quality of life.

Five experimental diets were formulated to provide 40% crude protein and 11% dietary lipid (dry matter basis) with the yeast-based protein source replacing Special Select\u00AE menhaden fish meal at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary protein. Ten juvenile cobia (initial weight 11.5 g/fish) were randomly stocked in triplicate 300 l circular fiberglass tanks (n =30 treatment\u22121) and hand-fed the diets based upon total tank biomass two times daily at 0900 and 1400 h. Fish were group weighed weekly to monitor performance and adjust feeding rations. Water temperature and salinity were maintained at 27 \u00B0C and 15\u2030, respectively. At the end of the feeding trial, weight gain, ranging from 86% to 512%, and feed conversion ratio values, ranging from 1.9 to 5.8, were significantly affected by the inclusion of the yeast-based protein source, with decreasing values as inclusion levels of the yeast-based protein source rose above 25% of dietary protein. Cobia fed the diet containing 25% of dietary protein from the yeast-based protein source had equal weight gain and feed conversion ratio values as fish fed the control diet composed of 100% fish meal (503 vs. 512 and 1.9 vs. 1.9, respectively). Biological indices including hepatosomatic index, visceral somatic index and muscle ratio were all similarly affected by inclusion of the yeast-based protein source, with significant impacts when inclusion levels rose above 25% of dietary protein. As with the weight gain and feed efficiency ratio values, fish fed the diet containing 25% of protein from the yeast-based source had similar values as those observed in the control animals. This study represents the first attempt to utilize an organically certified protein source as a replacement for fish meal in diets for juvenile cobia. Although levels of inclusion of the yeast-based protein source above 50% of dietary protein resulted in detrimental effects on production characteristics, the data clearly suggest that, at a minimum, 25% of dietary protein can be provided by this yeast-based protein in diets for cobia.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lunger, Angela N.; Craig, S.

The purpose of this paper is to provide examples of \u201Chow to\u201D processes based on our current front-line experiences and research to practicing psychiatrists and mental health clinicians, inform practitioners about national guidelines affecting psychiatric care during the pandemic, and inform health care policy makers and health care systems about the challenges and continued needs of financial and administrative support for psychiatric physicians and mental health systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bojdani, Ermal; Rajagopalan, Aishwarya; Chen, Anderson; Gearin, Priya; Olcott, William; Shankar, Vikram; Cloutier, Alesia; Solomon, Haley; Naqvir, Nida Z.; Batty, Nicolas; Festin, Fe Erlita D.; Tahera, Dil; Chang, Grace; DeLisi, Lynn E.","journal":"Psychiatry Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d359a89dd7aba308ce6ea05ef5da95e2839eddbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200362.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120312269?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120312269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psychiatric care","health care systems","psychiatric physicians","mental health systems","pandemic","health care policy makers","mental health clinicians","World Health Organization","COVID","impact","US healthcare system","way healthcare services","clinical research","consultation services","present effects","emergency room","practitioners","outpatient","inpatient units","psychiatrists","national guidelines","setting of new","administrative support","older patients","flexibility","team of professionals","adjustment","evolving protocols","different expertise","various settings","current front-line experiences","processes","medical co-morbidities","training of residents","norm","coronavirus","challenges","SARS-CoV2 virus","Infection","ethical considerations","paper","examples","disease","community","compilation"],"language":"en"},

Clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) with Covid-19 remain poorly described. Methods We performed a retrospective case series of patients with OHT with Covid-19 admitted to one of two hospitals in Southeastern Michigan between March 21 and April 22, 2020. Clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record. Final date of follow-up was May 7, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and mortality data were collected and analyzed. Results We identified 13 patients with OHT admitted with Covid-19. The mean (\u00B1SD) age of patients was 61\u00B112 years, 100% were black males, and symptoms began 6\u00B14 days before admission. The most common symptoms included subjective fever (92%), shortness of breath (85%), and cough (77%). Six (46%) required admission to the intensive care unit. Two patients (15%) died during hospitalization. Conclusions Black men may be at increased risk for Covid-19 among patients with OHT. Presenting signs and symptoms in this cohort are similar to those in the general population. Elevated inflammatory markers on presentation appear to be associated with more severe illness.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ketcham, Scott W.; Adie, Sarah K.; Malliett, Ashley; Abdul-Aziz, Ahmad A.; Bitar, Abbas; Grafton, Gillian; Konerman, Matthew C.","journal":"Journal of cardiac failure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/521f3a8a1acbad6fcdc14c094d6a803cfda1af9c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417380/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420304152?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420304152; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.05.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OHT"],"locations":["China","Southeastern Michigan"],"keyphrases":["Covid","OHT","age of patients","Clinical data","retrospective case series of patients","Clinical characteristics","common symptoms","admission","black males","mortality data","Conclusions Black men","outcomes","orthotopic heart transplant","review","treatment","increased risk","laboratory","coronavirus disease","Abstract Background","subjective fever","Elevated inflammatory markers","presentation","electronic medical record","Methods","intensive care unit","cohort","Demographic","SD","years","China","hospitals","Southeastern Michigan","Final date of follow-up","general population","mean","signs","days","number of cases","shortness of breath","severe illness","Wuhan","cough","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

To identify and characterise the cause of diarrhoea observed during previous years, 164 animals on 14 dairy farms in northwestern Germany were included in this study. The calves were physically and parasitologically examined prior to turnout and until 21 days post turnout (d.p.t.). Mean animal weights decreased from 194.9kg at the start to 189.3kg bodyweight at the end of the study. In all herds, oocyst counts were very low prior to turnout and increased after the calves had been kept on pasture for at least 7 days. On Day 9 post turnout, 90% and at the end of the study (21d.p.t.) 70% of all animals showed Eimeria-positive faecal samples. During the course of the study, 79 (48.2%) animals passed faecal samples with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram. The predominant species identified was Eimeria alabamensis, which accounted for more than 83% of the oocysts counted. These parasitological findings matched the clinical observations. Diarrhoea was found in 130 (79.3%) of the study animals. At 5d.p.t. and thus prior to the rise of faecal oocyst counts, a significant increase in diarrhoea was recorded. Calves showing diarrhoea excreted statistically significantly more often over 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram faeces (0.28; p =0.0002) than calves without diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was also found during significantly more study days in animals with high oocyst counts (0.39; p =0.0001). These data indicate that in endemic areas first-year grazing calves must be considered at risk to develop clinical coccidiosis due to E. alabamensis infection during the first 2\u20133 weeks post turnout.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"von Samson-Himmelstjerna, G.; Epe, C.; Wirtherle, N.; von der Heyden, V.; Welz, C.; Radeloff, I.; Beening, J.; Carr, D.; Hellmann, K.; Schnieder, T.; Krieger, K.","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14ff495fed9d73de1698753a7f05072bfaf9e446.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115786.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401705005662; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401705005662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["study animals","study days","severe diarrhoea","cause of diarrhoea","days post turnout","Eimeria alabamensis","year grazing calves","alabamensis oocysts","rise of faecal oocyst counts","high oocyst counts","Eimeria-positive faecal samples","Eimeria parasites","clinical coccidiosis","clinical observations","alabamensis infection","year grazing stock","gram faeces","economic consequences","endemic areas","significant increase","dairy farms","northwestern Germany","previous years","risk","parasitological findings","Abstract Infections","predominant species","herds","bodyweight","Mean animal weights","data","pasture","start","weeks","course"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, E64d blocks the carboxy-terminal cleavage of p65, E64d also inhibits replication of MHV-A59 in murine DBT cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced virus titers and viral syncytia formation. This inhibition of replication is associated with a rapid shutoff of new viral RNA synthesis, in a manner similar to that seen in the presence of cycloheximide. The E64d-associated inhibition of RNA synthesis likely results from E64d-specific inhibition of processing of the gene 1 polyprotein, resulting in inactive proteinase or replicase proteins.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-month history of moderate-to-high fever was reported in an otherwise healthy 54-year-old man. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest showed a remarkable progressive enlargement of bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes within 2 weeks. Bronchofibroscopy manifested obvious luminal stenosis with swelling, thick pale mucosa, and disappearing of structures of trachea cricoid cartilage, followed by a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) with intense symmetric FDG uptake in larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes being demonstrated. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP) was finally reached. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received methylprednisolone 40 mg daily with a gradual tapering in a 4-month follow-up. OUTCOMES: The patient experienced no relapse of fever and lymph nodes enlargement in the 4-month follow-up. LESSONS: Even though long-term fever with multiple lymphadenectasis usually lead to a diagnosis of lymphoma, the bronchoscopic features and evidence from 18F-FDG PET/CT in this case were much more approximate to RP, indicating an importance of a sensible differential diagnosis of RP in patients who present with nonspecific features such as FUO and lymph nodes enlargement.

Health care authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities worldwide. A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P\u003C.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%). Most participants (n=276, 61.0%) used social media to obtain information on COVID-19. A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs worldwide, and further studies are warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth; Aldhaleei, Wafa Ali; Rahmani, Jamal; Mahabadi, Mohammadjavad Ashrafi; Bandari, Deepak Kumar","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193987.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320381/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["perceptions of HCWs","poor perception of COVID","positive perceptions of COVID","poor knowledge","significant proportion of HCWs","global threat of COVID","inadequate knowledge","poor understanding","social media","week","participants","Health care authorities","health care workers","coronavirus disease","web-based study","item survey instrument","awareness","rapid spread","delayed treatment","variables","profession","transmission","significance","level of association","age","response rate","information","total","preparedness activities","medical students","symptom onset","countries","CONCLUSIONS","Factors","METHODS","infection","minutes","doctors","outbreak","male","chi-square test","Educational interventions","cases","years","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","studies"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, there is a need for development of a rapid method of vaccine development that can respond to emerging pathogens in a short time frame. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in late 2012 demonstrate the importance of coronaviruses as emerging pathogens. The spike glycoproteins of coronaviruses reside on the surface of the virion and are responsible for virus entry. The spike glycoprotein is the major immunodominant antigen of coronaviruses and has proven to be an excellent target for vaccine designs that seek to block coronavirus entry and promote antibody targeting of infected cells. Vaccination strategies for coronaviruses have involved live attenuated virus, recombinant viruses, non-replicative virus-like particles expressing coronavirus proteins or DNA plasmids expressing coronavirus genes. None of these strategies has progressed to an approved human coronavirus vaccine in the ten years since SARS-CoV emerged. Here we describe a novel method for generating MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV full-length spike nanoparticles, which in combination with adjuvants are able to produce high titer antibodies in mice.","publish_time":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coleman, Christopher M; Liu, Ye V; Mu, Haiyan; Taylor, Justin K; Massare, Michael; Flyer, David C; Smith, Gale E; Frieman, Matthew B","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5f104ad571284de9a97619066155866b729870c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/43e23cb209c2ee3419efcca67f10e66c790a5e4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4058772.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14005180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.04.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14005180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","coronavirus entry","coronavirus proteins","coronavirus genes","emerging pathogens","traditional vaccine development","Development of vaccination strategies","approved human coronavirus vaccine","rapid method of vaccine development","spike glycoproteins of coronaviruses","SARS-CoV full-length spike nanoparticles","vaccine designs","importance of coronaviruses","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","attenuated virus","major immunodominant antigen of coronaviruses","non-replicative virus","Middle East respiratory syndrome","recombinant viruses","novel method","DNA plasmids","long process","adjuvants","combination","high titer antibodies","years","surface","sudden nature","virion","antibody","short time frame","mice","excellent target","need","infected cells"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are suggested to be potential promising platforms to protect against these respiratory viruses. This review updates important progress in the development of VLP vaccines against respiratory viruses. Areas Covered: This review summarizes progress in developing VLP and nanoparticle-based vaccines against influenza virus, RSV, and HMPV. The PubMed was mainly used to search for important research articles published since 2010 although earlier key articles were also referenced. The research area covered includes VLP and nanoparticle platform vaccines against seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza viruses as well as RSV and HMPV respiratory viruses. The production methods, immunogenic properties, and vaccine efficacy of respiratory VLP vaccines in preclinical animal models and clinical studies were reviewed in this article. Expert opinion: Previous and current preclinical and clinical studies suggest that recombinant VLP and nanoparticle vaccines are expected to be developed as promising alternative platforms against respiratory viruses in future.

It has serious implications for health expenditure, which accounts for nearly 20% of overall government expenditure. Here we assess the contribution of ageing and related factors to hospitalisation days in Hong Kong. We used hospital discharge data from all publicly funded hospitals in Hong Kong between 2001 and 2012. Methods: A decomposition method was used to examine the factors that account for the change of total hospitalisation days during the two periods, 2001-2004 and 2004-2012. The five factors include two demographic factors \u2013 population size and age-gender composition \u2013 and three service components \u2013 hospital discharge rate, number of discharge episodes per patient, and average length of stay (LOS) \u2013 which are all measured at age-gender group level. In order to assess the health cost burden in the future, we also project the total hospitalisation days up to 2041, for a range of scenarios. Results: During the decreasing period of hospitalisation days (2001-2004), the reduction of LOS contributed to about 60% of the reduction. For the period of increase (2004-2012), ageing is associated with an increase in total hospitalisation days of 1.03 million, followed by an increase in hospital discharge rates (0.67 million), an increase in the number of discharge episodes per patient (0.62 million), and population growth (0.43 million). The reduction of LOS has greatly offset these increases (-2.19 million days), and has become one of the most significant factors in containing the increasing number of hospitalisation days. Projected increases in total hospitalisation days under different scenarios have highlighted that the contribution of ageing will become even more prominent after 2022. Conclusion: Hong Kong is facing increasing healthcare burden caused by the rapid increase in demand for inpatient services due to ageing. Better management of inpatient services with the aim of increasing efficiency and reducing LOS, avoidable hospitalisation and readmission, without compromising patient satisfaction and quality of service, are crucial for containing the rapid and enormous increases in total hospitalisation days for Hong Kong. The results would be relevant to many rapidly ageing societies in this region.","publish_time":"2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwok, Chi Leung; Lee, Carmen KM; Lo, William TL; Yip, Paul SF","journal":"Int J Health Policy Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8e457ae28d8267ce76183b65b7ff026c346bec5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5337253.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15171/ijhpm.2016.108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28812795/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LOS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["increasing number of hospitalisation days","change of total hospitalisation days","decreasing period of hospitalisation days","avoidable hospitalisation","Hong Kong","contribution of ageing","rapid increase","period of increase","ageing societies","reduction of LOS","number of discharge episodes","hospital discharge data","related factors","hospital discharge rates","demographic factors","significant factors","increasing healthcare burden","enormous increases","patient satisfaction","Projected increases","health expenditure","Results","aim of increasing efficiency","age-gender composition","health cost burden","service components","quality of service","Better management of inpatient services","population size","age-gender group level","serious challenge","different scenarios","serious implications","population growth","range of scenarios","overall government expenditure","funded hospitals","average length of stay","readmission","demand","future","account","order","Conclusion","periods","decomposition method","Methods","region","Background"],"language":"en"},

The regulation of UPR upon HSV-1 infection is complex, and the downstream effectors can be detrimental to viral replication. Therefore, HSV-1 copes with the UPR to create a beneficial environment for its replication. UPR has three branches, including protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6). IRE1\u03B1 is the most conserved branch of UPR which has both RNase and kinase activities. Previous studies have shown that IRE1\u03B1 RNase activity was inactivated during HSV-1 infection. However, the effect of the two activities of IRE1\u03B1 on HSV-1 replication remains unknown. Results in this study showed that IRE1\u03B1 expression was up-regulated during HSV-1 infection. We found that in HEC-1-A cells, increasing RNase activity, or inhibiting kinase activity of IRE1\u03B1 led to viral suppression, indicating that the kinase activity of IRE1\u03B1 was beneficial, while the RNase activity was detrimental to viral replication. Further evidence showed that the kinase activity of IRE1\u03B1 leads to the activation of the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) pathway, which enhances viral replication. Taken together, our evidence suggests that IRE1\u03B1 is involved in HSV-1 replication, and its RNase and kinase activities play differential roles during viral infection.","publish_time":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Airong; Wang, Huanru; Li, Yanlei; Wang, Xiaohui; Chen, Deyan; Wu, Zhiwei","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeb63d391feee1b548adf8d5a208d70c3ee5c802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5618002.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9090235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28832521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV","IRE1\u03B1 RNase activity","inhibiting kinase activity of IRE1\u03B1","activities of IRE1\u03B1","viral replication","ER kinase","kinase activities","viral infection","IRE1\u03B1 expression","protein kinase RNA","viral suppression","regulation of UPR","conserved branch of UPR","unfolded protein response","evidence","protein-folding burden","host cells","beneficial environment","stress","differential roles","herpes simplex virus type","inositol","pathway","downstream effectors","N-terminal kinases","PKR","activated transcription factor","endoplasmic reticulum","PERK","activation","branches","Previous studies","ATF6","JNK","enzyme","study","Results","copes","HEC"],"language":"en"},

Thus, this antibody should be a potential candidate for treatment of elderly patients suffering from SARS.","publish_time":"2006-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Lili; Ni, Bing; Luo, Deyan; Zhao, Guangyu; Jia, Zhengcai; Zhang, Liangyan; Lin, Zhihua; Wang, Li; Zhang, Songle; Xing, Li; Li, Jintao; Liang, Yunfei; Shi, Xinfu; Zhao, TingTing; Zhou, Liyun; Wu, Yuzhang; Wang, Xiliang","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4405f053c281d58d610e73a17777162a08c1ef67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106264.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576906003109; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576906003109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","equine anti-SARS-CoV F","high susceptibility of elderly","treatment of elderly patients","various strategies","evaluation of strategies","various methods","Aged BALB","aged animals","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","c mice","potential candidate","valuable platform","validity","therapeutic setting","folds","model","viral load","antibody","lungs","study"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective MERS vaccine. Overall, vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV are mainly based upon the viral spike (S) protein, due to its vital role in the viral infectivity, although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, and non-structural protein 16 (NSP16) have also been reported. In general, the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types: viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, nanoparticle-based vaccine, inactivated-whole virus vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine, which are discussed in detail. Besides, the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of MERS-CoV infection are extensively reviewed.

A leading contributor to these concerning outcomes is a lack of available intensive care unit (intensive care unit) beds and mechanical ventilation support. Poorer health is associated with a higher risk for severe respiratory complications from the coronavirus. We hypothesize that impaired respiratory muscle performance is an underappreciated factor contributing to poor outcomes unfolding during the coronavirus pandemic. While impaired respiratory muscle performance is considered to be rare, it is more frequently encountered in patients with poorer health, in particular obesity. However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea. The purpose of this perspective paper is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic. We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervene if identified with the goal of unburdening healthcare systems during future pandemic crises. \u2022 Poor baseline health increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus infection and poorer outcomes. \u2022 Patients with poorer baseline health, notably obesity, are more likely to demonstrate impaired respiratory muscle performance, and poorer outcomes following intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. \u2022 This relationship indicates respiratory muscle performance may contribute to outcomes related to acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus infection in patients with poor baseline health.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Severin, Richard; Arena, Ross; Lavie, Carl J; Bond, Samantha; Phillips, Shane A.","journal":"Am J Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0761db0aad827f07a1dfed2cf3ecba940ee083f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182755.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320303478?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934320303478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impaired respiratory muscle performance","measures of respiratory muscle performance","potential role of respiratory muscle performance","poorer outcomes","Poorer health","coronavirus pandemic","poorer baseline health","poor outcomes","coronavirus infection","severe respiratory complications","risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome","Poor baseline health","concerning outcomes","patients","intensive care unit admission","lack of available intensive care unit","future pandemic crises","mechanical ventilation support","higher risk","goal of unburdening healthcare systems","perspective paper","particular obesity","beds","underappreciated factor","infectious virus","theoretical patient management model","symptoms","leading contributor","relationship","clinical practice","developed nations","purpose","dyspnea"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated a multiplexed microarray for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against CNS pathogens. The performance of selected microarray antigens for the detection of IgG antibodies against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, was evaluated using serum sample panels tested with reference assays used in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The microarray sensitivity for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, adenovirus and M. pneumonia ranged from 77% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 74% to 97%. Very variable sensitivities and specificities were found for borrelial antigens of three different VlsE protein IR(6) peptide variants (IR6p1, IR6p2, IR6p4) and three recombinant decorin binding proteins A (DbpA; DbpAIa, DbpA91, DbpAG40). For single antigens, good specificity was shown for antigens of IR6p4 and DbpAIa (96%), while DbpA91, IR6p1 and IR6p2 were moderately specific (88\u201392%). The analytical sensitivity of the microarray was dependent on the borrelial IgG concentration of the specimen. The overall performance and technical features of the platform showed that the platform supports both recombinant proteins, whole viruses and peptides as antigens. This study showed diagnostic potential for all six CNS pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, using glutaraldehyde based microarray, and further highlighted the importance of careful antigen selection and the requirement for the use of multiple borrelial antigens in order to increase specificity without a major lack of sensitivity.","publish_time":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00E4\u00E4skel\u00E4inen, Anne J.; Viitala, Sari M.; Kurkela, Satu; Hepojoki, Satu; Sillanp\u00E4\u00E4, Heidi; Kallio-Kokko, Hannimari; Bergstr\u00F6m, Tomas; Suni, Jukka; N\u00E4rv\u00E4nen, Ale; Vapalahti, Olli; Vaheri, Antti","journal":"J Microbiol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a47e947e1902cdfd8d03f1908b30b27f91fe92d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172757.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701214000517; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701214000517; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2014.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594410/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigens of IR6p4","microarray sensitivity","HSV","single antigens","performance of selected microarray antigens","use of multiple borrelial antigens","multiplexed microarray","CNS pathogens","Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato","simultaneous detection of antibodies","detection of IgG antibodies","borrelial IgG concentration","adenovirus","recombinant proteins","diagnostic potential","VZV","IR6p2","good specificity","IR6p1","platform","DbpAIa","analytical sensitivity","DbpA91","study","major lack of sensitivity","multiple potential causative agents","recombinant decorin binding proteins","overall performance","simultaneous pathogen screening","herpes simplex virus","varicella-zoster virus","routine diagnostic laboratory","infections","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","reference assays","peptide variants","requirement","different VlsE protein IR","order","serum sample panels","glutaraldehyde","Central nervous system","importance of careful antigen selection","technical features","specificities","viruses","peptides","useful tool","DbpAG40","specimen","variable sensitivities"],"language":"en"},

The present study aimed to evaluate presence and changes in luminal lung concentrations of the APPs haptoglobin (Hp), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactoferrin (Lf) in calves with an acute respiratory disease experimentally induced by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci. RESULTS: Intra-bronchial inoculation of the pathogen resulted in a consistent respiratory illness. In venous blood of the infected calves (n = 13), concentrations of plasma proteins and serum LBP were assessed (i) before exposure and (ii) 8 times within 14 days after inoculation (dpi). Increasing clinical illness correlated significantly with increasing LBP\u2014and decreasing albumin concentrations in blood, both verifying a systemic acute phase response. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from all 13 calves experimentally infected with C. psittaci at 4, 9 and 14 dpi, and from 6 uninfected healthy calves. Concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA), Hp, LBP, CRP and Lf in BALF were determined by ELISA. In infected animals, absolute concentrations of LBP and Hp in BALF correlated significantly with the respiratory score. The quotient [LBP]/[BSA] in BALF peaked significantly in acutely infected animals (4 dpi), showed a time-dependent decrease during the recovery phase (9-14 dpi), and was significantly higher compared to healthy controls. Concentrations of Hp and Lf in BALF as well as [Hp]/[BSA]\u2014and [Lf]/[BSA]-quotients decreased during the study in infected animals, but were never higher than in healthy controls. CRP concentrations and [CRP]/[BSA]-quotient did not express significant differences between infected and healthy animals or during the course of infection. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, absolute concentrations of LBP in blood and BALF as well as the quotient [LBP]/[BSA] in BALF perfectly paralleled the clinical course of respiratory illness after infection. Beside LBP, the suitability of Hp and Lf as local biomarkers of respiratory infections in cattle and their role in the local response to pathogens is worth further investigation, while CRP does not seem to play a role in local defense mechanisms of the bovine lung.","publish_time":"2015-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prohl, Annette; Schroedl, Wieland; Rhode, Heidrun; Reinhold, Petra","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb113c8235675412d874b092faf5b997ac410434.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4515006.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0485-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BALF","Hp","CRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Concentrations of Hp","BALF","CRP concentrations","absolute concentrations of LBP","BSA","serum LBP","increasing LBP","albumin concentrations","infected animals","infected calves","healthy animals","luminal lung concentrations","concentrations of plasma proteins","Concentrations of bovine serum albumin","suitability of Hp","local response","acute respiratory disease","role","clinical course of respiratory illness","consistent respiratory illness","respiratory score","uninfected healthy calves","healthy controls","local biomarkers of respiratory infections","acute phase proteins","local reaction","systemic acute phase response","clinical illness","local defense mechanisms","bovine lung","recovery phase","venous blood","course of infection","CONCLUSION","psittaci","systemic inflammatory mediators","APPs haptoglobin","inflammatory stimuli","present study","lipopolysaccharide binding protein","C-reactive protein","Intra-bronchial inoculation","presence","cattle","express significant differences","Cumulating reports","pathogens","changes","different tissues","Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid","investigation","Chlamydia","lactoferrin","time-dependent decrease","times","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","quotients","days","ELISA","exposure"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, immunoscreenings of expression libraries via polyclonal sera on nitrocellulose membranes or screenings of whole proteome lysates in 2-D gel electrophoresis are performed. However, these methods feature some rather inconvenient disadvantages. Screening of expression libraries to expose novel antigens from bacteria often lead to an abundance of false positive signals owing to the high cross reactivity of polyclonal antibodies towards the proteins of the expression host. A method is presented that overcomes many disadvantages of the old procedures. RESULTS: Four proteins that have previously been described as immunogenic have successfully been assessed immunogenic abilities with our method. One protein with no known immunogenic behaviour before suggested potential immunogenicity. We incorporated a fusion tag prior to our genes of interest and attached the expressed fusion proteins covalently on microarrays. This enhances the specific binding of the proteins compared to nitrocellulose. Thus, it helps to reduce the number of false positives significantly. It enables us to screen for immunogenic proteins in a shorter time, with more samples and statistical reliability. We validated our method by employing several known genes from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented offers a new approach for screening of bacterial expression libraries to illuminate novel proteins with immunogenic features. It could provide a powerful and attractive alternative to existing methods and help to detect and identify vaccine candidates, biomarkers and potential virulence-associated factors with immunogenic behaviour furthering the knowledge of virulence and pathogenicity of studied bacteria.","publish_time":"2012-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F; von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d25e47796b1250f545c2b7e5b2dc191eaa3735f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3368735.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-3155-10-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22436172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection of immunogenic proteins","novel proteins","immunogenic features","immunogenic abilities","known immunogenic behaviour","expressed fusion proteins","Screening of expression libraries","immunoscreenings of expression libraries","screening of bacterial expression libraries","expression host","new potential vaccine candidates","potential immunogenicity","known genes","potential virulence-associated factors","pathogenicity of studied bacteria","knowledge of virulence","polyclonal sera","nitrocellulose membranes","new approach","novel antigens","understanding of pathogenicity","existing methods","inconvenient disadvantages","fusion tag","spectrum of biomarkers applicable","number of false positives","abundance of false positive signals","high cross reactivity of polyclonal antibodies","proteome lysates","important task","life sciences","shorter time","samples","attractive alternative","diagnostic tools","Campylobacter jejuni NCTC","D gel electrophoresis","microarrays","BACKGROUND","statistical reliability","specific binding","old procedures","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay. Flusurvey, the UK\u2019s largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation. However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza. OBJECTIVE: We designed a pilot study to see if it was feasible to ask individuals from the Flusurvey platform to perform a self-swabbing task and to assess whether they were able to collect samples with a suitable viral content to detect an influenza virus in the laboratory. METHODS: Virological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform. If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: A total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples. In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%). CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study. This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible. Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity.","publish_time":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wenham, Clare; Gray, Eleanor R; Keane, Candice E; Donati, Matthew; Paolotti, Daniela; Pebody, Richard; Fragaszy, Ellen; McKendry, Rachel A; Edmunds, W John","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5856931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29496658/; https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Flusurvey"],"organizations":["ILI","UK","Public Health England"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance of influenza","Flusurvey surveillance","ILI symptoms","Routine influenza surveillance","influenza virus","influenza infection","traditional surveillance","method of surveillance","influenza season","confirmed influenza","viral cause of ILI","Flusurvey platform","Internet-based surveillance","self-swabbing task","pilot study participants","virological laboratory testing","Virological swabbing kits","true burden of influenza","samples","larger online surveillance activities","laboratory confirmation of viral infection","real-time estimates of ILI circulation","Public Health England laboratory","online cohort study","health behavior","voluntary participants","health professional","community transmission","suitable viral content","swab kits","routine data","UK\u2019s largest crowd-sourced platform","respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing","population","swabs","illness","minimal time delay","pandemic","significant numbers","proof of concept","total","start","METHODS","individuals","BACKGROUND","initial stages","interseasonal activity","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","criticism","methodology","OBJECTIVE","definition"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to investigate whether a clinical practice examination (CPX) preparation program improves students\u0027 CPX score in terms of case specificity. METHODS: One hundred and thirteen senior students in a medical school participated in this study. During the fourth-year clerkship, 28 students (24.8%) from three rotation groups took a 3-day CPX preparation course consisting of module development, role play, and comprehensive physical exam skills training. Eleven rotation groups (n=85) were compared as control. Both the intervention and control group took two comprehensive CPXs before and after the clerkship was completed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, sex, and school type between the two groups. On pre-test CPX, there was no significant difference in total and sectional scores between the two groups. On post-test CPX, total scores of the intervention group were higher than those of the control groups (69.5\u00B14.3 vs. 67.5\u00B14.4, P\u003C0.05).

We demonstrated that intranasal delivery of VSV-VP1 can induce a potent antigen-specific mucosal immune response as well as a systemic immune response, particularly the induction of polyfunctional T cells. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-VP1 were better protected against CVB3-induced viral myocarditis than those receiving a chitosan-formulated DNA vaccine. Increased dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was observed in the mice vaccinated with VSV-VP1, which could be a potential mechanism for the protective immune response.

In this study, we analyzed type I IFN subtypes for their effect on prophylactic adenovirus-based anti-retroviral vaccination of mice against Friend retrovirus (FV) or HIV. RESULTS: Mice were vaccinated with adenoviral vectors encoding FV Env and Gag proteins alone or in combination with vectors encoding IFN\u03B11, IFN\u03B12, IFN\u03B14, IFN\u03B15, IFN\u03B16, IFN\u03B19 or IFN\u03B2. Only the co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFN\u03B12, IFN\u03B14, IFN\u03B16 and IFN\u03B19 resulted in strongly improved immune protection of vaccinated mice from subsequent FV challenge infection with high control over FV-induced splenomegaly and reduced viral loads. The level of protection correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4(\u002B )T cell responses and enhanced antibody titers. Similar results were obtained when mice were vaccinated against HIV with adenoviral vectors encoding HIV Env and Gag-Pol in combination with various type I IFN encoding vectors. Here mainly CD4(\u002B )T cell responses were enhanced by IFN\u03B1 subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that certain IFN\u03B1 subtypes have the potential to improve the protective effect of adenovirus-based vaccines against retroviruses. This correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4(\u002B )T cell and antibody responses. Thus, co-expression of select type I IFNs may be a valuable tool for the development of anti-retroviral vaccines.","publish_time":"2011-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayer, Wibke; Lietz, Ruth; Ontikatze, Teona; Johrden, Lena; Tenbusch, Matthias; Nabi, Ghulam; Schimmer, Simone; Groitl, Peter; Wolf, Hans; Berry, Cassandra M; \u00DCberla, Klaus; Dittmer, Ulf; Wildner, Oliver","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c0c7b9bdc81461fbf533ae6b89fd78326651306.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3193818.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-8-75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21943056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Friend"],"organizations":["HIV Env"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FV Env","T cell responses","co-administration of adenoviral vectors","HIV Env","antibody responses","immune protection of vaccinated mice","IFN subtypes","various type","anti-retroviral vaccination of mice","augmented virus-specific CD4","IFN\u03B12","FV-induced splenomegaly","combination","IFN\u03B14","IFNs","IFN\u03B19","IFN\u03B16","certain IFN\u03B1 subtypes","based vaccines","Similar results","subsequent FV challenge infection","development of anti-retroviral vaccines","protective effect of adenovirus","enhanced antibody titers","Gag-Pol","Gag proteins","prophylactic adenovirus","level of protection","co-expression","high control","Friend retrovirus","IFN\u03B15","direct antiviral effects","interferons","potential","IFN\u03B11","valuable tool","distinct immunomodulatory properties","viral loads","IFN\u03B2","BACKGROUND","retroviruses","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

The main robust claim from most such models is the negative relation between complexity and the accumulation rate of mutations. Viruses accumulate escape mutations in their epitopes to avoid detection and destruction of their host cell by CD8\u002B T cells. The extreme regime of immune escape, namely, strong selection and high mutation rate, provide an opportunity to extend and validate the existing models of relation between complexity and evolution rate as proposed by Fisher and Kimura. Using epitope prediction algorithms to compute the epitopes presented on the most frequent human HLA alleles in over 100 fully sequenced human viruses, and over 900 non-human viruses, we here study the correlation between viruses/proteins complexity (as measured by the number of proteins in the virus and the length of each protein, respectively) and the rate of accumulation of escape mutation. The latter is evaluated by measuring the normalized epitope density of viral proteins. If the virus/protein complexity prevents the accumulation of escape mutations, the epitope density is expected to be positively correlated with both the number of proteins in the virus and the length of proteins. We show that such correlations are indeed observed for most human viruses. For non-human viruses the correlations were much less significant, indicating that the correlation is indeed induced by human HLA molecules.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agranovich, Alexandra; Maman, Yaakov; Louzoun, Yoram","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4be5e5e95884bbd33c489335d131e98674af006c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106205.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23954420/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813002967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.07.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813002967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteins complexity","non-human viruses","sequenced human viruses","length of proteins","number of proteins","rate of accumulation","protein complexity","accumulation rate of mutations","accumulation of escape mutations","complexity of organisms","human HLA molecules","normalized epitope density of viral proteins","frequent human HLA alleles","high mutation rate","existing models of relation","epitopes","negative relation","correlations","extreme regime of immune escape","epitope prediction algorithms","evolution rates","context of multiple generic models","host cell","strong selection","CD8","destruction","detection","T cells","opportunity","main robust claim","Fisher","Kimura"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses have evolved mechanisms for generating their own cap structures with methylation at the N7 position of the capped guanine and the ribose 2\u2032-Oposition of the first nucleotide, which help viral RNAs escape recognition by the host innate immune system. The RNA genomes of coronavirus were identified to have 5\u2032-caps in the early 1980s. However, for decades the RNA capping mechanisms of coronaviruses remained unknown. Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5\u2032-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Human Rhinovirus (HRV) infection in the acute attack of wheezy chest which began after a respiratory illness. Methodology The study was conducted on 200 children aged 2 months to 5 years presenting to the emergency department with an acute wheezy episode either for the first time or recurrent wheeze defined as \u003E2 reports of wheezing in the first 3 years of life. All subjects were subjected to a complete history and clinical examination. Chest X-ray was done to all subjects. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from all subjects and the presence of HRV was determined by PCR examination. Results By PCR method, 163 patients (81.5%) were positive for viral infection. Due to viral co-infection, 49.5% (99 cases) were \u002Bve for Respiratory Syncytial virus followed by HRV 43.5% (87 cases).

CNS infection initiates a strong local immune response that fails to control the virus but is responsible for by-stander lesions involved in neurocognitive disorders. Although highly active anti-retroviral therapy now offers an almost complete control of CNS viral proliferation, low-grade CNS inflammation persists. This review focuses on HIV-induced intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis. Intrathecal Ig synthesis early occurs in more than three-quarters of patients in response to viral infection of the CNS and persists throughout the course of the disease. Viral antigens are targeted but this specific response accounts for \u003C 5% of the whole intrathecal synthesis. Although the nature and mechanisms leading to non-specific synthesis are unknown, this prominent proportion is comparable to that observed in various CNS viral infections. Cerebrospinal fluid-floating antibody-secreting cells account for a minority of the whole synthesis, which mainly takes place in perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the CNS parenchyma. B-cell traffic and lineage across the blood\u2013brain-barrier have not yet been described. We review common technical pitfalls and update the pending questions in the field. Moreover, since HIV infection is associated with an intrathecal chronic oligoclonal (and mostly non-specific) Ig synthesis and associates with low-grade axonal lesions, this could be an interesting model of the chronic intrathecal synthesis occurring during multiple sclerosis.","publish_time":"2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonnan, Mickael; Barroso, Bruno; Demasles, St\u00E9phanie; Krim, Elsa; Marasescu, Raluca; Miquel, Marie","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0881c190dedf8b87e07407549365e40229d6b1dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125908.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572815001277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26198917/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2015.05.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572815001277","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS infection","Intrathecal Ig synthesis","chronic intrathecal synthesis","non-specific synthesis","CNS parenchyma","HIV infection","low-grade CNS inflammation","various CNS viral infections","complete control of CNS viral proliferation","intrathecal immunoglobulin","intrathecal chronic oligoclonal","primary infection","Viral antigens","review","low-grade axonal lesions","specific response accounts","strong local immune response","stander lesions","associates","Cerebrospinal fluid-floating antibody-secreting cells account","blood","lineage","perivascular inflammatory infiltrates","central nervous system","pending questions","prominent proportion","interesting model","place","minority","mechanisms","multiple sclerosis","active anti-retroviral therapy","common technical pitfalls","B-cell traffic","quarters of patients","neurocognitive disorders","resident macrophages","nature","brain-barrier","field","virus","course","disease"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that the severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury during URI, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs), is related to AOM complication. METHODS: LDH concentrations were determined in NPS samples (n = 594) that were collected at the initial visit for URI from 183 children who were followed for the development of AOM. A subset of NPS samples (n = 134) was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 concentrations. RESULTS: AOM complication was independently predicted by LDH concentrations (median mU/ml with AOM = 2,438 vs. without AOM = 1,573; estimate = 0.276; P = 0.02). LDH effect on AOM development was highest during the first 4 d of URI. LDH concentrations were higher in URIs due to adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and rhinoviruses as compared with virus-negative samples (P \u003C 0.05). There was a positive correlation between concentrations of LDH and all cytokines (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: LDH concentrations in NPS are positively associated with AOM risk, suggesting that the severity of nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during URI contributes to the development of AOM and that reduction of inflammatory injury may reduce the risk for AOM.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ede, Linda C.; O\u2019Brien, James; Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Han, Yimei; Patel, Janak A.","journal":"Pediatr Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29cbbfbb1ae888ea2504584b4f87070e8698d1cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c4f1924395fe010018f7e83f71f5a0ba744dcf2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3612027.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202721/; https://doi.org/10.1038/pr.2012.179","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPS","AOM","LDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LDH concentrations","concentrations of LDH","AOM complication","development of AOM","AOM development","AOM risk","LDH effect","\u03B1 concentrations","d of URI","severity of nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury","subset of NPS samples","severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury","reduction of inflammatory injury","nasopharyngeal secretions","virus-negative samples","frequent complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection","TNF","URIs","tumor necrosis factor","Acute otitis media","lactate dehydrogenase","rhinoviruses","adenoviruses","BACKGROUND","children","NPSs","median mU","bocaviruses","initial visit","positive correlation","cytokines","CONCLUSION","interleukin","estimate","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The available treatment modalities are very costly and produces severe side effects. Drug repurposing that relate to new uses for old drugs has emerged as a novel approach for drug development. Repositioning of old, clinically approved, off patent non-cancer drugs with known targets, into newer indication is like using old weapons for new battle. The advances in genomics, proteomics and information computational biology has facilitated the process of drug repurposing. Repositioning approach not only fastens the process of drug development but also offers more effective, cheaper, safer drugs with lesser/known side effects. During the last decade, drugs such as alkylating agents, anthracyclins, antimetabolite, CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor and mitotic inhibitors has been repositioned for breast cancer treatment. The repositioned drugs have been successfully used for the treatment of most aggressive triple negative breast cancer. The literature review suggest that serendipity plays a major role in the drug development. This article describes the comprehensive overview of the current scenario of drug repurposing for the breast cancer treatment. The strategies as well as several examples of repurposed drugs are provided. The challenges associated with drug repurposing are discussed.","publish_time":"2019-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aggarwal, Sadhna; Verma, Sumit Singh; Aggarwal, Sumit; Gupta, Subash Chandra","journal":"Semin Cancer Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b6e8a9925f7b7052a2ee8f276791c1b1bb51229.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128772.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2019.09.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X19302949; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044579X19302949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["breast cancer treatment","old drugs","process of drug repurposing","process of drug development","repositioned drugs","patent non-cancer drugs","safer drugs","current scenario of drug repurposing","examples of repurposed drugs","aggressive triple negative breast cancer","Repositioning of old","available treatment modalities","leading cause of cancer deaths","aromatase inhibitor","mTOR inhibitor","old weapons","Repositioning approach","effects","known targets","new uses","new battle","novel approach","CDK4","mitotic inhibitors","information computational biology","alkylating agents","newer indication","genomics","proteomics","antimetabolite","anthracyclins","prevention","comprehensive overview","major role","serendipity","women","tremendous resources","advances","decade","literature review","Abstract","article","challenges","strategies"],"language":"en"},

Insider managerial shareholding (IMS) includes two different classes of owners: managers and directors (i.e., managers\u2019 shareholding [MAS] plus directors\u2019 shareholding [DIRS]). The indicators of financial performance under consideration are return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), stock return (SR), and Tobin\u0027s Q. In addition to analyzing total insider managerial ownership (IMS), the study splits IMS into two components (MAS and DIRS) and examines each of them, separately. Subsequently, panel regression tests examine the effects of IMS, MAS, and DIRS on financial performance of Taiwanese tourist hotels. Test results suggest that IMS explains ROA, ROE and Tobin\u0027s Q, but not SR. Further, compared to MAS, DIRS has a more significant impact on hotel performance. Specifically, an inverted U-shape represents the effects of IMS and DIRS on hotel performance (ROA, ROE and Tobin\u0027s Q), indicating that both IMS and DIRS have a significantly positive impact on hotel performance up to an optimal point (supporting the convergence-of-interests hypothesis). Further, when IMS and DIRS are greater than their corresponding optimal points, these two factors can significantly deteriorate hotel performance (supporting the entrenchment hypothesis).","publish_time":"2012-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ming-Hsiang; Hou, Chun-Ling; Lee, Seoki","journal":"International Journal of Hospitality Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc7c45a1c7504d898298bf2ec53798e051bb9458.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117003.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2011.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431911000764; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431911000764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tobin","ROE"],"organizations":["IMS","DIRS","MAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DIRS","hotel performance","effects of IMS","MAS","indicators of financial performance","study splits IMS","financial performance of Taiwanese tourist hotels","ROA","Insider managerial shareholding","ROE","impact of insider managerial ownership","Tobin\u0027s Q","total insider managerial ownership","managers\u2019 shareholding","directors\u2019 shareholding","significant impact","positive impact","stock return","traded tourist hotels","entrenchment hypothesis","interests hypothesis","corresponding optimal points","factors","consideration","addition","components","different classes of owners","convergence","SR","equity","panel regression tests","inverted U-shape","assets","Test results"],"language":"en"},

However, the most recent experimental study, using naturally infected influenza volunteers as the source, showed negative results from all the manikins that were exposed.

Second, the systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization on what constituted aerosol-generating procedures was summarized.

Tackling risk factors may reduce transmission and infection. However, risk factors involved in one setting may not be generalizable in all settings due to differences in climate, residential environment, population genetic and cultural backgrounds. This study aims to identify risk factors of FRI and mono-viral infections in a tropical military environment. METHODS: From year 2009 to 2012, military personnel with temperature \u226537.5 \u00B0C, cough and/or sore throat, and personnel with no fever or no respiratory symptoms were recruited as cases and controls, respectively. Subjects provided nasal wash specimens and answered a standardized questionnaire. Resplex assays were used to determine the viral etiologies. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses of the variables were performed using appropriate descriptive tests and logistic regression modelling, respectively, with R program. RESULTS: A total of 7,743 FRI cases and 1,247 non-FRI study controls were recruited. Increasing age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.03; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.05], recruit camp (AOR = 4.67; 95 % CI = 3.99-5.46) and smoker (AOR = 1.31; 95 % CI = 1.13-1.52) were independent risk factors of FRI. Malay ethnicity was positively associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (AOR = 1.50; 95 % CI = 1.04-2.15) and coxsackie/echovirus (AOR = 1.67; 95 % CI = 1.19-2.36) mono-infection. Significant contact risk factors were stay-out personnel with ill household member (AOR = 4.96; 95 % CI = 3.39-7.24), and stay-in personnel with ill bunkmate and household member (AOR = 3.55; 95 % CI = 2.57-4.91). Staying in camp with none ill in bunk and at home was a protective factor against FRI (AOR = 0.80; 95 % CI = 0.64-0.99). These contact risk factors were similarly observed for the five most common viruses detected, namely adenovirus, rhinoviruses, influenza A and B, and coxsackie/echovirus. CONCLUSION: Increasing age, smoker, recruit-camp, stay-out personnel with ill household members and stay-in personnel with ill bunkmates were independent risk factors of FRI in a semi-closed military environment. Early identification and isolation of ill personnel from their bunk may be effective to prevent and reduce transmission and disease burden.","publish_time":"2015-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pang, Junxiong; Jin, Jing; Loh, Jin Phang; Tan, Boon Huan; Koh, Wee Hong Victor; Ng, Sock Hoon; Ho, Zheng Jie Marc; Gao, Qiuhan; Cook, Alex R; Hsu, Li Yang; Lee, Vernon J; Chen, Mark I Cheng","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0511ed1c3e91902ab662c81f8fc20c83a840e8d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4514976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26208494/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1024-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AOR","independent risk factors","military personnel","isolation of ill personnel","Significant contact risk factors","ill bunkmates","ill household members","semi-closed military environment","recruit camp","recruit-camp","tropical military environment","residential environment","influenza","results","cases","Increasing age","transmission","smoker","mono-infection","study controls","coxsackie","echovirus","semi-closed environments","mono-viral infections","substantial burden","respiratory symptoms","disease burden","viral etiologies","appropriate descriptive tests","Febrile respiratory illness","variables","logistic regression modelling","climate","population genetic","differences","Malay ethnicity","nasal wash specimens","cultural backgrounds","cough","adenovirus","rhinoviruses","multivariate analyses","sore throat","fever","adjusted odds ratio","temperature","Early identification","standardized questionnaire","protective factor","Subjects","settings","home","CONCLUSION","H1N1","pdm09","year","common viruses","R program","total","confidence interval","Resplex assays","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We found that GL treatment leads to a clear reduction in the number of IAV-infected human lung cells as well as a reduction in the CCID50 titer by 90%. The antiviral effect, however, was limited to one or two virus replication cycles. Analysis of different GL treatment protocols suggested that the antiviral effect of GL was limited to an early step in the virus replication cycle. A direct inhibitory action of GL on IAV particles could be excluded and GL did not interact with virus receptor binding either. The antiviral effect of GL was abolished by treatment 1h after virus infection, whereas pre-treatment and treatment during and after virus adsorption led to a reduction in the cytopathic effect, reduced viral RNA within the cells and in the cell supernatants, and reduced viral hemagglutination titers. Detailed virus uptake analyses unambiguously demonstrated reduced virus uptake in various GL-treated cells. These observations lead to the conclusion, that the antiviral activity of GL is mediated by an interaction with the cell membrane which most likely results in reduced endocytotic activity and hence reduced virus uptake. These insights might help in the design of structurally related compounds leading to potent anti-influenza therapeutics.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolkerstorfer, Andrea; Kurz, Harald; Bachhofner, Nicole; Szolar, Oliver H.J.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d80f69f6ea60aef7c258bcab7dd4b997c19c24d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126985.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209003222; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209003222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416738/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.04.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reduced virus uptake","antiviral effect of GL","virus infection","virus adsorption","antiviral activity of GL","virus replication cycles","various GL-treated cells","virus receptor binding","Detailed virus uptake analyses","Analysis of different GL treatment protocols","direct inhibitory action of GL","reduced endocytotic activity","cytopathic effect","number of IAV","IAV particles","clear reduction","infected human lung cells","cell membrane","cell supernatants","viral RNA","viral hemagglutination titers","potent anti-influenza therapeutics","likely results","main active component of licorice roots","related compounds","early step","pre-treatment","design","glycyrrhizin","conclusion","interaction","CCID50 titer","mechanism","insights","observations"],"language":"en"},

Human respiratory epithelial cells are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can support productive viral replication. However, the induction of antiviral cytokines and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are substantially dampened in the infected epithelial cells, due to the antagonistic mechanisms evolved by the virus. MERS-CoV can readily infect and robustly replicate in human macrophages and dendritic cells, triggering the aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. MERS-CoV can also effectively infect human primary T cells and induce massive apoptosis in these cells. Although data from clinical, in vitro and ex vivo studies suggested the potential for virus dissemination, extrapulmonary involvement in MERS patients has not been ascertained due to the lack of autopsy study. In MERS-CoV permissive animal models, although viral RNA can be detected from multiple organs of the affected animals, the brain of human DPP4-transgenic mouse was the only extrapulmonary organ from which the infectious virus can be recovered. More research findings on the pathogenesis of MERS and the tissue tropisms of MERS-CoV may help to improve the treatment and infection control of MERS.","publish_time":"2015-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Jie; Chu, Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12f712c348c26e092759d804778defe2d2d4af6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4687146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26690369/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0446-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Middle-East Respiratory","MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of MERS","MERS patients","pathogenesis of human MERS-CoV infection","infection control of MERS","human primary cells","tissue tropisms of MERS","continuing MERS epidemic","MERS-CoV permissive animal models","Human respiratory epithelial cells","human primary T cells","human macrophages","dendritic cells","human lung tissues","infected epithelial cells","severe respiratory infection","brain of human DPP4-transgenic mouse","virus dissemination","chemokines","infectious virus","animal studies","aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines","induction of antiviral cytokines","high case-fatality","extrapulmonary involvement","extrapulmonary organ","viral RNA","experimental findings","research findings","Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","productive viral replication","potential","affected animals","massive apoptosis","multiple organs","treatment","antagonistic mechanisms","major threat","public health","humans","lack of autopsy study","data"],"language":"en"},

Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1\u20133]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples. METHODS: | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China\u0027s \u27EApneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) \u27EB, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1]. The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 \u00B1 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests. RESULTS: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times). DISCUSSION|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Jiasheng; Li, Shijun; Peng, Zhiyang; Xiao, Zhe; Wang, Xufeng; Yan, Ruicheng; Luo, Jianfei","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d72589b7f23b7429ee5d9f8239e09929b8f15718.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165102.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301411?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311437/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920301411; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101673","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV nucleic acid positive","nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate","nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum","nCoV nucleic acid test of feces","nucleic acid detection samples","nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab","cases of COVID","nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples","positive rate of blood","anal swabs of COVID","viral nucleic acids","diagnosis of COVID","times","designated COVID","nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection","treatment of confirmed COVID","cases of severe type","Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab","RT-PCR test kits","false negative rate","upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs","cases of common type","cases of critical type","RT-PCR testing","brand of test kit","East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","Wuhan City","reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","clinical manifestations","better guide clinical treatment","clinical application","negative controls","pneumonia diagnosis","Disease Control","kind of acute severe pneumonia","patients","Hubei Province","RESULTS","Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","infectious disease areas","corona virus disease","treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection","gold standard","digestive tract","internal controls","standard process","strict accordance","period of admission","observation study","viral gene sequencing","multi-sample","China\u0027s","accuracy","condition of tertiary protection","trial version","present","BioGerm","Chinese Center","isolation ward","Prevention","years","therapeutic effect","diagnostic criteria","world","females","average age","laboratory","technician","outbreak trend","reports","METHODS","batch of tests","parts","DISCUSSION","country"],"language":"en"},

The pathogenesis of SFTSV infection is poorly understood. However, it has been suggested that immune mechanisms, including cytokines and chemokines, play an important role in disease pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated host cytokine and chemokine profiles in serum samples of patients with SFTSV infection from Northeast China and explored a possible correlation between cytokine levels and disease severity. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Acute phase serum samples from 40 patients, diagnosed with SFTSV infection were included. Patients were divided into two groups \u2013 severe or non-severe \u2013 based on disease severity. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B2, interleukin-6, interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, IFN- \u03B3-induced protein (IP)-10 and RANTES were measured in the serum samples with commercial ELISAs.

Current border screening measures are insufficiently sensitive. The study objectives were to describe the epidemiologic pattern of influenza infection among incoming travellers at Xiamen International Airport during nonpandemic periods and to assess the performance of a rapid influenza diagnostic test in border screening. Methods Between May 2015 and May 2016, travellers with influenza-like illnesses entering China at Xiamen International Airport were screened with a rapid test, Flu Dot-ELISA, and the collected specimens were further subjected to virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis. Results Of the 1 540 076 incoming travellers, 1224 cases of influenza-like illness were identified; 261 tested positive in the rapid test, and 176 were confirmed to be influenza through virus culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were demonstrated to be 96.6% (170/176) and 91.3% (957/1048), respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 65.1% (170/261) and 99.4% (957/963), respectively. The epidemiologic study indicated that H3N2 and (H1N1)pdm09 were dominant in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, an increased number of influenza B isolates and cocirculation of both Victoria and Yamagata lineage influenza B viruses were observed, and mismatches between circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B Victoria lineage strains and vaccine strains also occurred. Conclusions We demonstrated the suitability and value of a high-sensitivity rapid influenza test in border screening and highlighted the importance of incoming travellers as a source of imported infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, J.; Yang, K.; Zhang, M.; Shen, C.; Wang, G.; Huang, S.; Xiong, H.; Chen, H.; Chen, Y.; Xia, N.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b88b8fe0acb89cf127fb4d07d6f38897c3491e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128276.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X17302884; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2017.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28587905/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X17302884","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Yamagata","Victoria"],"keyphrases":["circulating influenza","cases of influenza","rapid influenza diagnostic test","rapid test","high-sensitivity rapid influenza test","influenza B Victoria lineage strains","epidemiologic pattern of influenza infection","Yamagata lineage influenza B viruses","increased number of influenza B isolates","importance of incoming travellers","Current border screening measures","Xiamen International Airport","H1N1","cross-border transmission of infectious diseases","pdm09","epidemiologic study","study objectives","vaccine strains","virus isolation","Abstract Objectives","virus culture","negative predictive values","cocirculation","performance","illnesses","nonpandemic periods","worldwide public health issue","Flu Dot-ELISA","mismatches","source","China","collected specimens","H3N2","suitability","phylogenetic analysis","specificity","Conclusions","Results","Methods"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Citrate\u2010treated porcine plasma of pH 7\u00B75, 9\u00B78 and 10\u00B72 (8\u00B75% dry\u2010matter) was spiked with PEDV, PSV1, PCV2 and AdV and incubated at 3\u00B0C for maximum 24 h, and at 44 or 48\u00B0C for maximum 10 min (Experiment 1). Spiked citrate\u2010treated concentrated plasma of pH 7\u00B75 and 9\u00B78 (24% dry\u2010matter) was spray dried in a laboratory scale apparatus (Experiment 2). Aliquots of SDPP were stored over a period of 0\u201310 weeks at 11 and 20\u00B0C (Experiment 3). Reverse transcription(RT)\u2010quantitative PCR detected no notable reduction in viral genomes in treated plasma and SDPP samples. No infectious PSV1 was re\u2010isolated from plasma and SDPP samples in cell culture. At pH 10\u00B72 and 3\u00B0C, infectivity of PEDV in plasma was reduced with a reduction factor of 4\u00B72 log 10 (LRF) at 10 h contact time, whereas heating to 44\u00B0C for at least 1 min at alkali pH was needed to achieve a LRF of 4\u00B72 for AdV. Spray drying at an outlet temperature of 80\u00B0C reduced AdV infectivity effectively (LRF = 5\u00B72) and PEDV infectivity for 95% (LRF = 1\u00B74). After storage at 20\u00B0C for 2 weeks no infectious PEDV was re\u2010isolated from SDPP anymore (LRF \u22654\u00B70). Due to growth of antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria from plasma in cell cultures used for PCV2 isolation, no data regarding inactivation of PCV2 were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Five percent of PEDV stayed infectious after our spray drying conditions. Spray drying in combination with storage for \u22652 weeks at 20\u00B0C eliminated infectivity of PEDV effectively. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The conditions for inactivation of virus in plasma and SDPP determined are important for producers to inactivate PEDV during production of SDPP.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hulst, M.M.; Heres, L.; Hakze\u2010van der Honing, R.W.; Pelser, M.; Fox, M.; van der Poel, W.H.M.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed6b1dc674893e435945a5efbd1eef13a7c56bc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6849764.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6849764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDPP","PEDV","AdV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectivity of PEDV","PEDV infectivity","porcine plasma of pH","treated plasma","infectious PEDV","dried porcine plasma","LRF","SDPP samples","production of SDPP","percent of PEDV","C reduced AdV infectivity","concentrated plasma of pH","Aliquots of SDPP","inactivation of PCV2","production of spray","porcine sapelovirus","porcine circovirus","infectious PSV1","weeks","Experiment","inactivation of virus","PCV2 isolation","alkali pH","important viruses porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","inactivation of adenovirus","physical conditions","Spiked citrate","matter","storage","notable reduction","cell cultures","reduction factor","h contact time","viral genomes","quantitative PCR","resistant bacteria","outlet temperature","Evaluation","laboratory scale apparatus","STUDY","heating","data","RESULTS","producers","Reverse transcription","growth of antibiotic","IMPACT","log","combination","SIGNIFICANCE","AIM","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","period"],"language":"en"},

Electron microscopic observation revealed that the NDiV strain isolated in China produced viral nucleocapsid-like particles and vesicles in host cells. The extracellular virions were enveloped and were spherical with short spikes. The complete genome sequence of the newly isolated NDiV was submitted to the GenBank database (GenBank accession number KF522691).

A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that these viruses belong to the genus Alphamesonivirus1 of the family Mesoniviridae.

In addition, it remains unclear whether tissue specific factors contribute to RNA and protein-based antiviral immunity mechanisms. In vivo screens to identify such factors are challenging and time consuming. In addition, the scored phenotype is usually limited to survival and/or viral load. Transgenic viral replicons are valuable tools to overcome these limitations and screen for novel antiviral factors. Here we describe transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines encoding a Flock House Virus-derived replicon (FHV\u2206B2eGFP), expressing GFP as a reporter of viral replication. This replicon is efficiently controlled by the siRNA pathway in most somatic tissues, with GFP fluorescence providing a reliable marker for the activity of antiviral RNAi. Interestingly, in follicular somatic cells (FSC) of ovaries, this replicon is still partially repressed in an siRNA independent manner. We did not detect replicon derived Piwi-interacting RNAs in FSCs and identified 31 differentially expressed genes between restrictive and permissive FSCs. Altogether, our results uncovered a yet unidentified RNAi-independent mechanism controlling FHV replication in FSCs of ovaries and validate the FHV\u2206B2eGFP replicon as a tool to screen for novel tissue specific antiviral mechanisms.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martins, Nelson; Lemoine, Aur\u00E9lie; Santiago, Estelle; Paro, Simona; Imler, Jean-Luc; Meignin, Carine","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c601e38de42c9188e237fe848d26c4a7c07c3d58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6385967.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Drosophila"],"organizations":["Transgenic","GFP","FHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel antiviral factors","B2eGFP replicon","antiviral immunity mechanisms","FHV replication","novel tissue specific antiviral mechanisms","activity of antiviral RNAi","replicon derived Piwi","control of viral replication","reporter of viral replication","FSCs of ovaries","siRNA pathway","viral load","tissue specific factors","Transgenic viral replicons","Flock House Virus-derived replicon","best studied invertebrate antiviral response","permissive FSCs","siRNA independent manner","addition","GFP fluorescence","somatic tissues","unidentified RNAi-independent mechanism","characterized protein","small interfering RNA","follicular somatic cells","transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines","limitations","valuable tools","reliable marker","survival","genes","RNAs","scored phenotype","insects","results","time consuming","screens"],"language":"en"},

Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. More than 95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p\u003C0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p\u003C0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.

The central domain of the nucleocapsid protein contains several arginine/serine (RS) dipeptides, the biological significance of which has not been well investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated primarily within the RS\u2010rich region in cells and by SR protein kinase 1 in vitro. The nucleocapsid protein could suppress translation and its RS motif is essential for such an activity. Moreover, phosphorylation of the RS motif could modulate the translation inhibitory activity of the nucleocapsid protein. We further found that RS motif phosphorylation did not significantly affect RNA binding of the nucleocapsid protein but impaired its multimerization ability. We observed that the nucleocapsid protein could translocate to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to cellular stress. Deletion or mutations of the RS motif enhanced stress granule localization of the nucleocapsid protein, whereas overexpression of SR protein kinase 1 inhibited nucleocapsid protein localization to stress granules. The nucleocapsid protein lacking the RS motif formed high\u2010order RNP complexes, which may also account for its enhanced stress granule localization. Taken together, phosphorylation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010CoV nucleocapsid protein modulates its activity in translation control and also interferes with its oligomerization and aggregation in stress granules.","publish_time":"2008-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Tsui\u2010Yi; Lee, Kuan\u2010Rong; Tarn, Woan\u2010Yuh","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f394214d79be643597d3716bbf80a061a6ad04d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18631359/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06564.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV nucleocapsid protein","inhibited nucleocapsid protein localization","RS motif phosphorylation","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein","overexpression of SR protein kinase","RS motif enhanced stress granule localization","cellular stress","cytoplasmic stress granules","translation inhibitory activity","translation control","infected cells","RNA binding","viral RNA replication","dipeptides","response","mutations","arginine","serine","order RNP complexes","rich region","oligomerization","transcription","biological significance","aggregation","Deletion","central domain","multimerization ability","present study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We studied 20 patients admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China from January 22 to February 12, 2020. Data were extracted from medical records. These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020. RESULTS: Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients. The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%). Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more community clustered. Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces. Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission. Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Ziying; Cao, Huijuan; Jie, Yusheng; Huang, Zhanlian; Guo, Xiaoyan; Chen, Junfeng; Peng, Liang; Cao, Hong; Dai, Xiaoling; Liu, Jing; Li, Xuejun; Zhu, Jianyun; Xu, Wenxiong; Chen, Dabiao; Gao, Zhiliang; He, Jian-Rong; Lin, Bing-Liang","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b5edd2e409c245c0934d4e7cb2d04f1c1fe1731.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194579.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278758/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101664; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920301320","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Guangzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["Guangzhou patients","Wuhan patients","cases","Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital","initial epicenter of Wuhan","negative nasopharyngeal swabs","persistent positive RNA","feces","vs","possible prolonged transmission period","process of transmission","SARS-CoV","Affiliated Hospital","possible diminishing virulence","Fecal SARA-CoV","pathogenicity","potential changes","Yat-Sen University","better prognosis","epidemiological characteristics","current quarantine practices","study","vomiting","Lancet","BACKGROUND","Coronavirus disease","COVID","epidemic","higher mortality rate","CONCLUSIONS","China","RESULTS","Data","medical records","Diarrhea","ICU","community clustered","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The transcriptional activity of 2A protease was independent of its protease activity. EV71 2A protease retained its transcriptional activity after truncation of 40 amino acids at the N-terminus but lost this activity after truncation of 60 amino acids at the N-terminus or deletion of 20 amino acids at the C-terminus. Thus, the acidic domain at the C-terminus of this protein is essential for its transcriptional activity. Indeed, deletion of amino acids from 146 to 149 (EAME) in this acidic domain lost the transcriptional activity of EV71 2A protein though still retained its protease activity. EV71 2A protease was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus using confocal microscopy analysis. Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease also exhibited transcriptional activity in yeast cells. As expected, an acidic domain in the C-terminus of Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease was also identified. Truncation of this acidic domain resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity. Interestingly, this acidic region of poliovirus 2A protease is critical for viral RNA replication. The transcriptional activity of the EV71 or Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease should play a role in viral replication and/or pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Chee-Hing; Li, Hui-Chun; Jiang, Jeng-Geng; Hsu, Che-Fang; Wang, Yi-Jen; Lai, Meng-Jiun; Juang, Yue-Li; Lo, Shih-Yen","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95c1dc78f1775a83d61ad2517a26844f9a3c46b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2923119.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-17-65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protease activity","transcriptional activity of EV71","strong transcriptional activity","loss of transcriptional activity","acidic domain","C-terminus","N-terminus","deletion of amino acids","Coxsackie virus B3","truncation","acidic region of poliovirus","protein","yeast cells","viral replication","viral RNA replication","cytoplasm","nucleus","confocal microscopy analysis","role","EAME","pathogenesis","Enterovirus type"],"language":"en"},

No standardised technique has been reported specifically for viral sampling in the sinonasal passages. Aim: To optimise viral sampling techniques from the sinonasal cavity. Methods: Sterile cytology brushes were used under endoscopic guidance to sample the sinonasal mucosa at time of endoscopic sinus surgery at both the middle and inferior meatuses (MM and IM). DNA and RNA were extracted from the samples and underwent PCR or RT-PCR testing, respectively, for a panel of 15 common upper respiratory tract viruses. Results: Twenty-four adult patients were recruited for this study. 18/24 (75%) patients were positive for virus in at least one site, while 8/24 (33%) were positive for virus at both sites. The mean number of viruses identified at the two sites were similar (0.875 \u00B1 0.899 at the MM vs. 0.750 \u00B1 1.032 at the IM). 6/24 (25%) of patients showed no virus at either site, while 3/24 (12.5%) demonstrated the same viral species at both sites. Conclusion: Although the number of viruses present at different sites with the nasal cavity are similar, discord exists in the viral species between sites. It is therefore recommended that both sites are sampled in the clinical and research setting better to characterise the viral species within the nasal cavity.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goggin, Rachel K.; Bennett, Catherine A.; Bassiouni, Ahmed; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn; Vreugde, Sarah; Wormald, Peter-John; Psaltis, Alkis J.","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/377c6ff0f04a67152f6029e2836500abddac3d57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6156342.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283747/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2018.00334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral species","different sites","sinonasal cavity","viral sampling techniques","sinonasal mucosa","sinonasal passages","mean number of viruses","adult patients","common upper respiratory tract viruses","endoscopic guidance","validated techniques","standardised technique","RT-PCR testing","time of endoscopic sinus surgery","health","disease","panel","discord","Sterile cytology brushes","important factor","microbiome","inferior meatuses","emergence","Methods","samples","accurate characterisation","RNA","Results","study","research","Conclusion","DNA","Background"],"language":"en"},

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 \u00D7 10(1) pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 \u00D7 10(2) copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Giwan; Lee, Geonhee; Kim, Mi Jeong; Baek, Seung-Hwa; Choi, Minsuk; Ku, Keun Bon; Lee, Chang-Seop; Jun, Sangmi; Park, Daeui; Kim, Hong Gi; Kim, Seong-Jun; Lee, Jeong-O; Kim, Bum Tae; Park, Edmond Changkyun; Kim, Seung Il","journal":"ACS Nano","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db9423c4feed4cae29e94ec3dd403f3c0f9a4834.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e1d1d7457960c17f7a93cf8cf31dbb6c35f447aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172500.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c02823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","FET"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","COVID","FET device","FET sensor","spike protein","clinical samples","promising FET biosensor","fg","Coronavirus disease","antigen protein","based biosensing device","clinical transport medium","LOD","outbreak","emerging human infectious disease","culture medium","specific antibody","specific drugs","rate of human infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cultured virus","nasopharyngeal swab specimens","management","sensitive immunological diagnostic method","World Health Organization","coating graphene sheets","early diagnosis","limit of detection","phosphate-buffered saline","field-effect transistor","text","concentrations","rapid increase","Image","patients","vaccines","pfu","pandemic","addition","sample pretreatment","performance","nCoV","copies"],"language":"en"},

The strategy thus measures the dependence of the neighbors on the focal node, identifying the ability of this node to spread the disease.

Due to the complexity of the neural control of lower urinary tract, micturition is sensitive to numerous injuries, such as spinal cord injury, cerebral infarction, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and spina bifida, which result in various types of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction.

METHODS: We recorded the initial release dates of each report related to avian flu or H1N1 listed on the WHO Disease Outbreak News site and the matching outbreak report from ProMED-mail, a non-governmental program for monitoring emerging diseases, from 2003 to the end of June 2009. The timeliness gap was calculated as the difference in days between the report release dates of the matching outbreaks in the WHO and ProMED-mail systems. Civil liberties scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index and data indicating the density of physicians and nurses were collected to reflect countries\u2019 development and health workforce statuses. Then, logistic regression was performed to determine the correlation between the timeliness gap and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status, controlling for year. RESULTS: The reporting timeliness gap for avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks significantly decreased after 2003. On average, reports were posted 4.09 (SD = 7.99) days earlier by ProMED-mail than by the WHO. Countries with partly free (OR = 5.77) and free civil liberties scores (OR = 10.57) had significantly higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps than non-free countries. Similarly, countries with very high human development status had significantly higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps than countries with middle or low human development status (OR = 5.30). However, no association between the timeliness gap and health workforce density was found. CONCLUSION: The study found that the adoption of IHR 2005, which contributed to countries\u2019 awareness of the importance of timely reporting, had a significant impact in improving the reporting timeliness gap. In addition, the greater the civil liberties in a country (e.g., importance of freedom of the media), the longer the timeliness gap.","publish_time":"2013-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Feng-Jen; Tseng, Eva; Chan, Chang-Chuan; Tamashiro, Hiko; Motamed, Sandrine; Rougemont, Andr\u00E9 C","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/424061f2444cab0c4e972c7fcfc18a9dfbe7b4c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3615947.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-8603-9-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23531369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO Disease Outbreak News"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reporting timeliness gap","higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps","countries\u2019 development","Human Development Index","health workforce density","ProMED-mail systems","low human development status","high human development status","free civil liberties scores","health workforce statuses","H1N1 outbreaks","avian flu","non-free countries","matching outbreaks","country transparency","matching outbreak report","report release dates","International Health Regulations","major global health surveillance systems","importance of timely reporting","days","association","reports","study","initial release dates","countries\u2019 awareness","density of physicians","importance of freedom","adoption of IHR","non-governmental program","Disease Outbreak News site","significant impact","data","indicators","difference","emerging diseases","amendment","nurses","incidents","correlation","media","addition","year","RESULTS","length of time","METHODS","SD","logistic regression","average","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Condensation of peracetylated 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-glucopyranose (1) with silylated N 4-benzoyl cytosine, followed by selective deprotection and isopropylidenation afforded compound 2. Routine deoxygenation at position 2\u2032, followed by a deprotection-selective reprotection sequence afforded the partially tritylated dideoxy nucleoside of cytosine 6, which upon oxidation of the free hydroxyl group at the 4\u2032-position, furnished the desired tritylated 2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro ketonucleoside 7a in equilibrium with its hydrated form 7b. Compound 2 was the starting material for the synthesis of the dideoxy fluoro ketopyranonucleoside 13a. Similarly, several subsequent protection and deprotection steps as well as routine deoxygenation at position 4\u2032, followed by oxidation of the free hydroxyl group at the 2\u2032-position of the partially tritylated dideoxy nucleoside 12, yielded the desired carbonyl compound 13a in equilibrium with its hydrated form 13b.

Herein, a total of 35 novel compounds were chemically synthesized and single crystal of 6\u20136 was obtained to confirm the molecular structure of this family of compounds. The novel PTB derivatives were fully evaluated against various biological platforms. From the bioassay results, the best AHAS inhibitor 6\u201322 displayed weaker herbicidal activity but stronger anti-Candida activity than PTB did. For plant pathogenic fungi, 6\u201326 showed excellent activity at 50 mg/L dosage. Preliminary insecticidal activity and antiviral activity were also observed for some title compounds. Strikingly, 6\u20135 exhibited a promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV Mpro with IC 50 of 4.471 \u03BCM and a low cellular cytotoxicity against mammalian 293 T cells. Based on the results of molecular modeling, HOMO-1 was considered to be a factor that affects AHAS inhibition and a possible binding mode of 6\u20135 with SARS-CoV Mpro was predicted. This is the first time that PTB derivatives have been studied as biological agents other than herbicides. The present research hence has suggested that more attentions should be paid to compounds belonging to this family to develop novel agrochemicals or medicines.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ren-Jun; Zhou, Kai-Xuan; Yang, Haijin; Song, Guo-Qing; Li, Yong-Hong; Fu, Jia-Xin; Zhang, Xiao; Yu, Shu-Jing; Wang, Li-Zhong; Xiong, Li-Xia; Niu, Cong-Wei; Song, Fu-Hang; Yang, Haitao; Wang, Jian-Guo","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdda4bba7ea376d1c23c3704fc09680015cb111c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111276.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784880/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.02.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523419301126; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523419301126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","excellent activity","novel compounds","novel PTB derivatives","family of compounds","weaker herbicidal activity","promising inhibitory activity","Preliminary insecticidal activity","title compounds","stronger anti-Candida activity","SARS-CoV Mpro","novel agrochemicals","results of molecular modeling","low toxicity","AHAS inhibition","bioassay results","biological agents","molecular structure","low cellular cytotoxicity","best AHAS inhibitor","various biological platforms","successful commercial herbicide","mammalian","\u03BCM","T cells","possible binding mode","mammals","pyrithiobac","HOMO","medicines","extensive study","single crystal","plant pathogenic fungi","herbicides","factor","attentions","Abstract","total","time","present research","dosage"],"language":"en"},

The algorithm supposes that some human individuals exist in an ecosystem; each individual is characterized by a number of features; an infectious disease (SARS) exists in the ecosystem and spreads among individuals, the disease attacks only a part of features of an individual. Each infected individual may pass through such states as susceptibility (S), exposure (E), infection (I), quarantine (Q) and recovery (R). State S, E, I, Q and R can automatically and dynamically divide all people in the ecosystem into five classes, it provides the diversity for SEIQRA; that people can be attacked by the infectious disease and then transfer it to other people can cause information exchange among people, information exchange can make a person to transit from one state to another; state transitions can be transformed into operators of SEIQRA; the algorithm has 13 legal state transitions, which corresponds to 13 operators; the transmission rules of the infectious disease among people is just the logic to control state transitions of individuals among S, E, I, Q and R, it is just the synergy of SEIQRA, the synergy can be transformed into the logic structure of the algorithm. The 13 operators in the algorithm provide a native opportunity to integrate many operations with different purposes; these operations include average, differential, expansion, chevy, reflection and crossover. The 13 operators are executed equi-probably; a stable heart rhythm of the algorithm is realized. Because the infectious disease can only attack a small part of organs of a person when it spreads among people, the part variables iteration strategy (PVI) can be ingeniously applied, thus enabling the algorithm to possess of high performance of computation, high suitability for solving some kinds of complicated optimization problems, especially high dimensional optimization problems. Results show that SEIQRA has characteristics of strong search capability and global convergence, and has a high convergence speed for some complicated functions optimization problems.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Guangqiu","journal":"Swarm and Evolutionary Computation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/232adb4422ce13d1ec09cde6ec7fc9c8d505ea5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104270.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2015.09.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650215000747; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210650215000747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["State S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["people","artificial infectious disease optimization algorithm","SEIQR algorithm","operators of SEIQRA","State S","state transitions of individuals","high dimensional optimization problems","disease attacks","synergy of SEIQRA","complicated function optimization problems","complicated functions optimization problems","kinds of complicated optimization problems","legal state transitions","ecosystem","high suitability","high convergence speed","operations","high performance of computation","information exchange","human individuals","person","spreads","infected individual","global convergence","number of features","logic structure","SEIQR epidemic model","expansion","average","characteristics of strong search capability","chevy","different purposes","transmission rules","reflection","variables iteration strategy","states","exposure","native opportunity","SARS","stable heart rhythm","PVI","crossover","quarantine","infection","susceptibility","equi","recovery","classes","diversity","organs","Results"],"language":"en"},

The former are NSP4-dependent, induce calcium-dependent chloride secretion and involve oxidative stress. Diosmectite (DS) is a natural clay that has been recommended as an active therapy for diarrhoea, but the mechanism of its effect is not clear. Electrical parameters may be used to measure the direct enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects in polar epithelial intestinal cells. To investigate the effects of DS on RV-induced enterotoxic and cytotoxic damage. Caco-2 cells were used as a model of RV infection to evaluate chloride secretion, epithelial integrity, oxidative stress and viral infectivity in Ussing chambers. RESULTS: Diosmectite reduced the expression of NSP4 and oxidative stress, resulting in a strong inhibition of chloride secretion. Preincubating RV with DS reduced the cytotoxic effect. Finally, the viral load was reduced by DS but not by control clay. This result suggests that DS specifically affects the early events of RV infection protecting the enterocyte, whereas it does not restore already-established cell damage. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that DS exerts an anti-diarrhoeal effect by inhibiting viral replication and the expression of NSP4. Both ion secretion and cell damage induced by RV are strongly inhibited consequent to the antiviral effect, which explains its clinical efficacy.","publish_time":"2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buccigrossi, Vittoria; Russo, Carla; Guarino, Amedeo; de Freitas, Maiara Brusco; Guarino, Alfredo","journal":"Gut Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57debc6d188282301818dada90a7cee441c45379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5404323.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-017-0172-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of DS","RV-induced enterotoxic","cytotoxic effects","Preincubating RV","cytotoxic damage","oxidative stress","model of RV infection","calcium-dependent chloride secretion","early events of RV infection","ion secretion","antiviral effect","NSP4-dependent","expression of NSP4","strong inhibition of chloride secretion","viral infectivity","viral replication","sequence of enterotoxic","direct enterotoxic","anti-diarrhoeal effect","viral load","established cell damage","Diosmectite","epithelial integrity","polar epithelial intestinal cells","natural clay","control clay","Ussing chambers","inhibited consequent","mechanism","findings","Rotavirus","enterocyte","active therapy","clinical efficacy","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","Electrical parameters","Caco"],"language":"en"},

To increase our understanding of avian pathogens and the susceptibility of poultry species, we developed novel avian tissue microarrays (TMAs). Tissue binding profiles of avian viral attachment proteins were studied by performing histochemistry on multi-species TMA, comprising of selected tissues from ten avian species, and single-species TMAs, grouping organ systems of each species together. The attachment pattern of the hemagglutinin protein was in line with the reported tropism of influenza virus H5N1, confirming the validity of TMAs in profiling the initial virus-host interaction. The previously believed chicken-specific coronavirus (CoV) M41 spike (S1) protein displayed a broad attachment pattern to respiratory tissues of various avian species, albeit with lower affinity than hemagglutinin, suggesting that other avian species might be susceptible for chicken CoV. When comparing tissue-specific binding patterns of various avian coronaviral S1 proteins on the single-species TMAs, chicken and partridge CoV S1 had predominant affinity for the trachea, while pigeon CoV S1 showed marked preference for lung of their respective hosts. Binding of all coronaviral S1 proteins was dependent on sialic acids; however, while chicken CoV S1 preferred sialic acids type I lactosamine (Gal(1-3)GlcNAc) over type II (Gal(1-4)GlcNAc), the fine glycan specificities of pigeon and partridge CoVs were different, as chicken CoV S1-specific sialylglycopolymers could not block their binding to tissues. Taken together, TMAs provide a novel platform in the field of infectious diseases to allow identification of binding specificities of viral attachment proteins and are helpful to gain insight into the susceptibility of host and organ for avian pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe, Iresha N.; de Vries, Robert P.; Eggert, Amber M.; Wandee, Nantaporn; de Haan, Cornelis A.

The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a significant slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS\u2019 average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza (J. Math. Biol. 27 (1989) 233). Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than 10% in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS. The possibility that 10 or more percent of the world population at risk could eventually be infected with the virus in conjunction with a mortality rate of 3\u20137% or more, and indications of significant improvement in Toronto support the stringent measures that have been taken to isolate diagnosed cases.","publish_time":"2003-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, G.; Fenimore, P.

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections with associated morbidity and mortality. Objectives The objective of our study was to characterize the epidemiology of CoVs in our tertiary care centre, and identify clinical correlates of disease severity. Study design A cross-sectional study was performed of 226 patients admitted with confirmed CoV respiratory tract infection between 2010 and 2016. Variables consistent with a severe disease burden were evaluated including symptoms, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Results CoVs represented 11.3% of all positive respiratory virus samples and OC43 was the most commonly identified CoV. The majority of infections were community-associated while 21.6% were considered nosocomial. The average length of stay was 11.8 days with 17.3% of patients requiring ICU admission and an all-cause mortality of 7%.

The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is an online repository that catalogs immune epitope reactivity data derived from articles listed in the National Library of Medicine PubMed database. The IEDB is maintained and continually updated by monitoring PubMed for new, potentially relevant references. METHODOLOGY: Herein we detail the classification of all epitope-specific literature in over 100 different immunological domains representing Infectious Diseases and Microbes, Autoimmunity, Allergy, Transplantation and Cancer. The relative number of references in each category reflects past and present areas of research on immune reactivities. In addition to describing the overall landscape of data distribution, this particular characterization of the epitope reference data also allows for the exploration of possible correlations with global disease morbidity and mortality data. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While in most cases diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality rates were amongst the most studied, a number of high impact diseases such as dengue, Schistosoma, HSV-2, B. pertussis and Chlamydia trachoma, were found to have very little coverage. The data analyzed in this fashion represents the first estimate of how reported immunological data corresponds to disease-related morbidity and mortality, and confirms significant discrepancies in the overall research foci versus disease burden, thus identifying important gaps to be pursued by future research. These findings may also provide a justification for redirecting a portion of research funds into some of the underfunded, critical disease areas.","publish_time":"2009-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, Vince; Vaughan, Kerrie; Damle, Rohini; Peters, Bjoern; Sette, Alessandro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b448dbfc87a470aabfb33c388d8dd7f2f830f58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2747625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774228/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006948","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IEDB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality data","immune epitope reactivity data","epitope reference data","Immune Epitope Database","disease-related morbidity","reported immunological data","global disease morbidity","Infectious Diseases","disease burden","high morbidity","immune responses","overall landscape of data distribution","immune reactivities","future research","critical disease areas","overall research foci","present areas of research","infectious microbes","cases diseases","number of high impact diseases","mortality rates","epitope-specific literature","monitoring PubMed","portion of research funds","IEDB","National Library of Medicine PubMed database","relative number of references","significant discrepancies","relevant references","scientific articles","cancer antigens","significant fraction","different immunological domains","particular characterization","category","allergens","autoantigens","Autoimmunity","online repository","exploration of possible correlations","various agents","transplants","dengue","Allergy","past","important gaps","Schistosoma","classification","Transplantation","estimate","pertussis","HSV","SIGNIFICANCE","justification","Chlamydia trachoma","BACKGROUND","addition","fashion","little coverage","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Northern blots of poly(A)\u002B RNA purified from infected cells hourly after infection and probed with pCV3 demonstrated that transcription of all FCV-specific RNAs are detectable at 2 to 3 h post-infection (PI) and that these RNAs reached steady state levels at approximately 4 h PI. The levels of the FCV RNAs then remained relatively constant through 7 h PI, the last time tested, with the exception of the 4.8 and 4.2 kb transcripts which showed a marked increase between 6 and 7 hours PI. Northern blots of dsRNA which had been LiCl-fractionated from pooled total cellular RNA isolated from 5-h and 7-h FCV infected cells, showed two double-stranded RNAs corresponding to the 8.2 kb genomic RNA and the 2.4 kb subgenomic RNA.

The impact of innate immunity mechanisms, such as mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL), on respiratory symptoms remains unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate whether cord blood MBL levels are associated with respiratory symptoms during infancy and to determine the relative contribution of MBL when compared with known risk factors. This is a prospective birth cohort study including 185 healthy term infants. MBL was measured in cord blood and categorized into tertiles. Frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms were assessed weekly until age one. Association with MBL levels was analysed using multivariable random effects Poisson regression. We observed a trend towards an increased incidence rate of severe respiratory symptoms in infants in the low MBL tertile when compared with infants in the middle MBL tertile [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95\u20132.66; p = 0.076]. Surprisingly, infants in the high MBL tertile suffered significantly more from severe and total respiratory symptoms than infants in the middle MBL tertile (IRR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.20\u20133.25; p = 0.008). This association was pronounced in infants of parents with asthma (IRR = 3.64; 95% CI: 1.47\u20139.02; p = 0.005). The relative risk associated with high MBL was similar to the risk associated with well\u2010known risk factors such as maternal smoking or childcare. In conclusion the association between low MBL levels and increased susceptibility to common respiratory infections during infancy was weaker than that previously reported. Instead, high cord blood MBL levels may represent a so far unrecognized risk factor for respiratory morbidity in infants of asthmatic parents.","publish_time":"2008-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlapbach, Luregn Jan; Latzin, Philipp; Regamey, Nicolas; Kuehni, Claudia E.; Zwahlen, Marcel; Casaulta, Carmen; Aebi, Christoph; Frey, Urs","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f118756994f77772b3083ea66d5fc3059bc2174.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167943.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2008.00782.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18700861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high MBL tertile","low MBL levels","low MBL tertile","middle MBL tertile","respiratory morbidity","high cord blood MBL levels","relative contribution of MBL","total respiratory symptoms","severity of respiratory symptoms","infants of parents","common respiratory infections","increased incidence rate of severe respiratory symptoms","relative risk","infants of asthmatic parents","healthy term infants","infancy","IRR","Association","well\u2010known risk factors","unrecognized risk factor","incidence rate ratio","increased susceptibility","considerable morbidity","prospective birth cohort study","mannose","multivariable random effects Poisson regression","maternal smoking","impact of innate immunity mechanisms","binding lectin","conclusion","childcare","trend","Frequency","confidence interval","tertiles","age","aims"],"language":"en"},

Mutation of ADAR1 leads to a severe neurodevelopmental and inflammatory disease of children, Aicardi-Gouti\u00E9res syndrome. In mice, Adar1 mutations are embryonic lethal but are rescued by mutation of the Mda5 or Mavs genes, which function in IFN induction. However, the specific IFN regulated proteins responsible for the pathogenic effects of ADAR1 mutation are unknown. We show that the cell-lethal phenotype of ADAR1 deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells is rescued by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the RNASEL gene or by expression of the RNase L antagonist, murine coronavirus NS2 accessory protein. Our result demonstrate that ablation of RNase L activity promotes survival of ADAR1 deficient cells even in the presence of MDA5 and MAVS, suggesting that the RNase L system is the primary sensor pathway for endogenous dsRNA that leads to cell death.

Methods Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (\u003E13%) black and all other (\u003C13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with \u003C13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with \u003E13% black residents. Conclusions Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Millett, Gregorio A.; Jones, Austin T.; Benkeser, David; Baral, Stefan; Mercer, Laina; Beyrer, Chris; Honermann, Brian; Lankiewicz, Elise; Mena, Leandro; Crowley, Jeffrey S.; Sherwood, Jennifer; Sullivan, Patrick","journal":"Annals of epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1cd60ea6bc145fd5bf6d2974af94b636609b589.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047279720301769; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279720301769?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["black counties","PAF of COVID","deaths","predictors of COVID","black communities","higher proportions of black residents","interactive scatterplot of COVID","percent of US counties","higher proportions of black people","small metro counties","cases","county-level data","diagnoses","available data","higher prevalence of comorbidities","county-level characteristics","County-level comparisons","incomplete data reporting","RR","epidemic duration","epidemic hot spots","poverty","disease","race","racial disparities","diagnosis","age","population attributable fractions","greater air pollution","structural racism","Abstract Purpose","lack of health insurance","factors","responses","risk","National maps","Rate ratios","negative binomial regression model","Social conditions","associated determinants","Methods","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I, n = 6, and III, n = 15) and 3-day-old (in exp. II, n = 9) KO and wild-type (WT, same ages in respective exps.) piglets were inoculated with TCID(50) 1x10(3) PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow\u2019s colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals either deceased or euthanized were necropsied and intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tu, Ching-Fu; Chuang, Chin-kai; Hsiao, Kai-Hsuan; Chen, Chien-Hong; Chen, Chi-Min; Peng, Su-Hei; Su, Yu-Hsiu; Chiou, Ming-Tang; Yen, Chon-Ho; Hung, Shao-Wen; Yang, Tien-Shuh; Chen, Chuan-Mu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e67d66fb0773322520aa527d533c6cffb08016a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6541307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141512/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217236","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["CRISPR","PEDV","TCID","CMAH KO","NGNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KO piglets","porcine CMAH KO","biallelic KO","health of piglets","CMAH gene","villus epithelial cells of WT piglets","CMP-N","detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid","hours post-PEDV inoculation","immunofluorescence staining","infection","clinical symptoms","hpi","animals","respective exps","Cas9 gene editing techniques","glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase","apparent outward clinical manifestations","Cas9 mRNA","inoculation similar","live founders","sow\u2019s colostrum","nullified NGNA expression","porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","CRISPR","pathological signs","enterocyte vacuolization","histopathologic inspection","scores","moderate exfoliation","cytoplasm","ages","single-guide RNAs","wild-type","knockouts","Ringer","groups","experiments","results","glucose solution","fertilized eggs","times","homozygous offspring","day-old","infant formula","Histopathology","1x10","TCID","severity","hypothesis","intestines","occurrence"],"language":"en"},

Mass spectrometry based proteomics could be used to efficiently study pathogen-host interactions and virus-hijacked cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, direct host and viral responses upon infection could be further investigated by activity-based functional validation studies. These approaches involve drug inhibition of secretory pathway, immunofluorescence staining, dominant negative mutant of protein target, real-time PCR, small interfering siRNA-mediated knockdown, and molecular cloning studies. In this way, functional validation could gain novel insights into the high-content proteomic dataset in an unbiased and comprehensive way.","publish_time":"2012-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Jie; Tan, Boon Huan; Sugrue, Richard; Tang, Kai","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49e18956b9fad9e6114912a46567cdc6b9555c02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23162545/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00393","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral responses","characterizing host responses","direct host","Delineation of sophisticated host responses","pathogen-host interactions","repertoire of host factors","virus infection","viral pathogenesis","functional validation studies","virus-hijacked cellular","viral infectious cycle","cellular machinery","comprehensive way","molecular cloning studies","immunofluorescence staining","real-time PCR","dominant negative mutant of protein target","small interfering siRNA-mediated knockdown","drug inhibition of secretory pathway","novel insights","high-content proteomic dataset","continuous survival","approaches","activity","challenging task","parasites of living organisms","pathways","Mass spectrometry","proteomics","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this review was to characterize the effectiveness of contact precautions alone against transmission of any MDRO among adult acute care patients. Directed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, comprehensive searches of four electronic scientific literature databases were conducted for studies published in English from January 2004 to June 2014. Studies were included if interventional, original research, evaluating contact isolation precautions against MDRO transmission among inpatients. Searches returned 284 studies, six of which were included in the review. These studies measured four different MDROs with one study showing a reduction in transmission. Whereas studies were of high quality regarding outcome operationalization and statistical analyses, overall quality was moderate to low due to poor intervention description, population characterization and potential biases. Where compliance was measured (N = 4), it presented a threat to validity because it included select parts of the intervention, ranged from 21% to 87%, and was significantly different across study phases (N = 2).

In this immune pathway, viral peptides within infected cells are presented to T-lymphocytes by the polymorphic human leukocyte antigens (HLA). HLA alleles exert selective pressure on the peptide regions and immune escape mutations that occur at some of the targeted sites can enable the virus to adapt to the infected host. The pattern of ongoing immune escape and reversion associated with several human HLA alleles has been studied extensively. Such mutations revert upon transmission to a host without the HLA allele because the escape mutation incurs a fitness cost. However, to-date there has been little attempt to study permanent loss of CTL epitopes due to escape mutations without an effect on fitness. RESULTS: Here, we set out to determine the extent of adaptation of HIV-1 to three well-characterized HLA alleles during the initial exposure of the virus to the human cytotoxic immune responses following transmission from chimpanzee. We generated a chimpanzee consensus sequence to approximate the virus sequence that was initially transmitted to the human host and used a method based on peptide binding affinity to HLA crystal structures to predict peptides that were potentially targeted by the HLA alleles on this sequence. Next, we used codon-based phylogenetic models to quantify the average selective pressure that acted on these regions during the period immediately following the zoonosis event, corresponding to the branch of the phylogenetic tree leading to the common ancestor of all of the HIV-1 sequences. Evidence for adaptive evolution during this period was observed at regions recognised by HLA A*6801 and A*0201, both of which are common in African populations. No evidence of adaptive evolution was observed at sites targeted by HLA-B*2705, which is a rare allele in African populations. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the ancestral HIV-1 virus experienced a period of positive selective pressure due to immune responses associated with HLA alleles that were common in the infected human population. We propose that this resulted in permanent escape from immune responses targeting unconstrained regions of the virus.","publish_time":"2009-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ngandu, Nobubelo K; Seoighe, Cathal; Scheffler, Konrad","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffef8194e52de95fe345db7dd12fe3185d786978.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2765438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818146/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-164","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA","CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human HLA alleles","HLA-B","immune escape mutations","human cytotoxic immune responses","well-characterized HLA alleles","immune pathway","HLA crystal structures","virus sequence","human host","pattern of ongoing immune escape","permanent escape","infected host","infected human population","peptide regions","cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response","period of positive selective pressure","unconstrained regions","infected cells","ancestral HIV","infected humans","targeted sites","average selective pressure","polymorphic human leukocyte antigens","transmission","common ancestor","chimpanzee consensus sequence","evidence of adaptive evolution","African populations","RESULTS","T-lymphocytes","phylogenetic models","viral peptides","phylogenetic tree","rare allele","fitness cost","peptide binding affinity","permanent loss of CTL epitopes","reversion","initial exposure","method","little attempt","branch","replication","zoonosis event","BACKGROUND","effect","date","codon","extent of adaptation","CONCLUSION","sequences"],"language":"en"},

The T cell epitopes of the SARS CoV spike protein are well known, but no systematic evaluation of the functional and structural roles of each residue has been reported for these antigenic epitopes. Analysis of the functional importance of side-chains by mutational study may exaggerate the effect by imposing a structural disturbance or an unusual steric, electrostatic or hydrophobic interaction. RESULTS: We demonstrated that N50 could induce significant IFN-gamma response from SARS-CoV S DNA immunized mice splenocytes by the means of ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS. Moreover, S366-374 was predicted to be an optimal epitope by bioinformatics tools: ANN, SMM, ARB and BIMAS, and confirmed by IFN-gamma response induced by a series of S358-374-derived peptides. Furthermore, each of S366-374 was replaced by alanine (A), lysine (K) or aspartic acid (D), respectively. ANN was used to estimate the binding affinity of single S366-374 mutants to H-2 Kd.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and analytical features of a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infected cohort with SCI to enable accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures. SETTING: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). METHODS: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was performed. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1\u201310). Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven). The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom). The Modified Early Warning System score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in five out of seven cases. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. CONCLUSION: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity.

Infection therefore requires close proximity of receptors and proteases. We considered whether tetraspanins, scaffolding proteins known to facilitate CoV infections, hold receptors and proteases together on cell membranes. Using knockout cell lines, we found that the tetraspanin CD9, but not the tetraspanin CD81, formed cell-surface complexes of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor, and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) member TMPRSS2, a CoV-activating protease. This CD9-facilitated condensation of receptors and proteases allowed MERS-CoV pseudoviruses to enter cells rapidly and efficiently. Without CD9, MERS-CoV viruses were not activated by TTSPs, and they trafficked into endosomes to be cleaved much later and less efficiently by cathepsins. Thus, we identified DPP4:CD9:TTSP as the protein complexes necessary for early, efficient MERS-CoV entry. To evaluate the importance of these complexes in an in vivo CoV infection model, we used recombinant Adenovirus 5 (rAd5) vectors to express human DPP4 in mouse lungs, thereby sensitizing the animals to MERS-CoV infection. When the rAd5-hDPP4 vectors co-expressed small RNAs silencing Cd9 or Tmprss2, the animals were significantly less susceptible, indicating that CD9 and TMPRSS2 facilitated robust in vivo MERS-CoV infection of mouse lungs. Furthermore, the S proteins of virulent mouse-adapted MERS-CoVs acquired a CD9-dependent cell entry character, suggesting that CD9 is a selective agent in the evolution of CoV virulence.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Earnest, James T.; Hantak, Michael P.; Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B.; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0749cab30d660b29d52b5346b02773a3f36fda0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5552337.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759649/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV receptor","MERS-CoV pseudoviruses","MERS-CoV viruses","CoV infections","MERS-CoV infection of mouse lungs","CoV infection model","tetraspanin CD9","efficient MERS-CoV entry","evolution of CoV virulence","CD9-dependent cell entry character","S proteins of virulent mouse-adapted MERS-CoVs","bound S proteins","cell membranes","proteases","proteins binding","scaffolding proteins","cellular receptors","condensation of receptors","knockout cell lines","S protein-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion","rAd5-hDPP4 vectors co-expressed small RNAs silencing Cd9","member TMPRSS2","protein complexes necessary","formed cell-surface complexes of dipeptidyl peptidase","close proximity of receptors","animals","human DPP4","tetraspanin CD81","transmembrane serine protease","proteolytic cleavage of receptor","viral spike","initiates","type","recombinant Adenovirus","enveloped coronaviruses","selective agent","TTSPs","cells","tetraspanins","endosomes","importance","cathepsins"],"language":"en"},

The molecular pathogenic mechanism of TGEV-induced diarrhea in piglets is unknown. Intestinal diarrhea is closely related to the function of the Na(\u002B)/H(\u002B) exchanger protein NHE3 in the brush border membrane of small intestine epithelial cells. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may act to regulate NHE3 expression. In addition, EGFR may promote viral invasion of host cells. The present study aimed to determine whether NHE3 activity is regulated by altering EGFR expression to affect Na(\u002B) absorption in TGEV-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells were used as models for TGEV infection. The results showed that Na(\u002B) absorption and NHE3 expression levels decreased in TGEV-infected cells. Proliferation of TGEV within IPEC-J2 cells could be inhibited by treatment with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and knockdown; resulting in recovery of Na(\u002B) absorption in TGEV infected cells and increasing the activity and expression of NHE3. Moreover, we demonstrated that NHE3 activity was regulated through the EGFR/ERK pathway. Importantly, NHE3 mobility on the plasma membrane of TGEV infected cells was significantly weaker than that in normal cells, and EGFR inhibition and knockdown recovered this mobility. Our research indicated that NHE3 activity was negatively regulated by EGFR in TGEV-infected intestinal epithelial cells.","publish_time":"2018-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Zhou; Ran, Ling; Yuan, Peng; Yang, Yang; Wang, Kai; Xie, Luyi; Huang, Shilei; Liu, Jia; Song, Zhenhui","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8863943c0c9153a3677761f16e704854c65c3783.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6243134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483239/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02734","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR","TGEV","EGFR/ERK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-infected cells","TGEV-infected intestinal epithelial cells","NHE3 activity","expression of NHE3","normal cells","EGFR expression","plasma membrane of TGEV infected cells","TGEV infection","NHE3 mobility","Porcine intestinal epithelial cells","Proliferation of TGEV","NHE3 expression levels","EGFR inhibition","IPEC-J2 cells","exchanger protein NHE3","viral invasion of host cells","EGFR inhibitor AG1478","absorption","Intestinal diarrhea","brush border membrane of small intestine epithelial cells","molecular pathogenic mechanism of TGEV","recovery of Na","knockdown","induced diarrhea","extensive research","pathogenesis of virus infection","swine industry","devastating economic losses","treatment","models","epidermal growth factor receptor","piglets","addition","Transmissible gastroenteritis","present study","ERK pathway","function","results"],"language":"en"},

In fact, more than 80% of infectious disease pathogens probably gain entry into the susceptible human hosts through open mucosal surfaces. Human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1), a mainly sexually transmitted virus, also primarily targets the vaginal and gastrointestinal mucosa as entry sites for viral transmission, seeding, replication and amplification. Since HIV-1 establishes its early replication in vaginal or rectal mucosal tissues, the induction of sufficient mucosal immunity at the initial site of HIV-1 transmission becomes essential for a protective vaccine. However, despite the fact that current conventional vaccine strategies have remained unsuccessful in preventing HIV-1 infection, sufficient financial support and resources have yet to be given to develop a vaccine able to elicit protective mucosal immunity against sexual transmissions. Interestingly, Chinese ancestors invented variolation through intranasal administration about one thousand years ago, which led to the discovery of a successful smallpox vaccine and the final eradication of the disease. It is the hope for all mankind that the development of a mucosal AIDS vaccine will ultimately help control the AIDS pandemic. In order to discover an effective mucosal AIDS vaccine, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of mucosal immunology and to test various mucosal vaccination strategies.","publish_time":"2010-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Xian; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab26098d2e9876c05c8c1fd3d30d45a749b944e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3185548.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v2010283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective mucosal AIDS vaccine","protective mucosal immunity","rectal mucosal tissues","protective vaccine","open mucosal surfaces","induction of sufficient mucosal immunity","various mucosal vaccination strategies","vaccine able","deep understanding of mucosal immunology","successful smallpox vaccine","current conventional vaccine strategies","human body","initial site of HIV","various pathogens","AIDS pandemic","fact","Human immunodeficiency virus type","susceptible human hosts","infectious disease pathogens","entry sites","viral transmission","early replication","transmitted virus","sufficient financial support","infection","seeding","largest surface area","gastrointestinal mucosa","line of natural host defense","intranasal administration","final eradication","development","Chinese ancestors","variolation","resources","sexual transmissions","amplification","discovery","mankind","order","years","hope"],"language":"en"},

This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of \u03B2-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel \u2018in house\u2019 (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of \u03B1-glucans and correspondingly less \u03B2-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine induced NF-\u03BAB activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contract, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-\u03B1, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-\u03B2 and IL-10. The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis.

METHODS: To evaluate CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 as cancer biomarkers, it was generated and characterised several novel specific polyclonal antibodies (PAb), monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and soluble Fab fragments (sFabs) against recombinant CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins, which were obtained from different sources, including a human antibody library and immunised animals. The antibodies and Fab fragments were tested for recognition of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins by immunoblotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in colorectal cell lines derived from tumour and cancer tissues. RESULTS: Both, antibodies and a Fab fragment showed high specificity since they recognised only their corresponding recombinant antigens, but not a panel of different unrelated- and related proteins. In Western blot analysis of CTHRC1, a monoclonal antibody designated CH21D7 was able to detect a band of the apparent molecular weight of a full-length CTHRC1 in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29. This result was confirmed by a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with the monoclonal antibodies CH21D7 and CH24G2, detecting CTHRC1 in HT29 and in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW620. Similar experiments were performed with PAb, MAbs, and sFab against NFE2L3. The immunoblot analysis showed that the monoclonal antibody 41HF8 recognised NFE2L3 in HT29, and leukocytes. These results were verified by DAS-ELISA assay using the pairs PAb/sFab E5 and MAb 41HF8/sFab E5. Furthermore, an immunoassay for simultaneous detection of the two cancer biomarkers was developed using a Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay technology (DELFIA). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the antibodies obtained in this study are specific for CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 since they do not cross-react with unrelated- and related proteins and are useful for specific measurement of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins. The antibodies and immunoassays may be useful for the analysis of CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 in clinical samples and for screening of therapeutic compounds in CRC.","publish_time":"2012-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palma, Marco; Lopez, Lissett; Garc\u00EDa, Margarita; de Roja, Nuria; Ruiz, Tamara; Garc\u00EDa, Julita; Rosell, Elisabet; Vela, Carmen; Rueda, Paloma; Rodriguez, Mar\u00EDa-Jose","journal":"BMC Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3aa91a0388f92a56fb94e74a81a88faafa50620.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3293008.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321245/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6890-12-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collagen Triple Helix","CRC","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NFE2L3 proteins","recombinant CTHRC1","full-length CTHRC1","recognition of native CTHRC1","monoclonal antibodies CH21D7","monoclonal antibody 41HF8 recognised NFE2L3","specific measurement of native CTHRC1","Western blot analysis of CTHRC1","related proteins","novel specific polyclonal antibodies","cancer biomarkers","cancer tissues","monoclonal antibody designated CH21D7","DAS-ELISA assay","diagnosis of colorectal cancer","immunoblotting analysis","sFab E5","human antibody library","colorectal cell lines","human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29","double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","pairs PAb","colorectal tumours","colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW620","MAbs","soluble Fab fragments","CRC","RESULTS","useful biomarker candidates","panel of different unrelated","MAb 41HF8","different sources","normal tissues","corresponding recombinant antigens","Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay technology","expression level","mRNA","clinical samples","sFabs","increase messenger RNA transcripts","DELFIA","band","adenomas","screening of therapeutic compounds","apparent molecular weight","CH24G2","Collagen Triple Helix Repeat","BACKGROUND","high specificity","immunised animals","simultaneous detection","study","Nuclear factor","leukocytes","immunoassays","Similar experiments","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to assess, via systematic review and meta-analysis, the effectiveness of both traditional strategies and contemporary innovations for retention adopted by longitudinal cohort studies in the past decade. METHODS: Health research databases were searched for retention strategies used within longitudinal cohort studies published in the 10-years prior, with 143 eligible longitudinal cohort studies identified (141 articles; sample size range: 30 to 61,895). Details on retention strategies and rates, research designs, and participant demographics were extracted. Meta-analyses of retained proportions were performed to examine the association between cohort retention rate and individual and thematically grouped retention strategies. RESULTS: Results identified 95 retention strategies, broadly classed as either: barrier-reduction, community-building, follow-up/reminder, or tracing strategies. Forty-four of these strategies had not been identified in previous reviews. Meta-regressions indicated that studies using barrier-reduction strategies retained 10% more of their sample (95%CI [0.13 to 1.08]; p = .01); however, studies using follow-up/reminder strategies lost an additional 10% of their sample (95%CI [\u2212 1.19 to \u2212 0.21]; p = .02). The overall number of strategies employed was not associated with retention. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a larger number of retention strategies may not be associated with improved retention in longitudinal cohort studies, contrary to earlier narrative reviews. Results suggest that strategies that aim to reduce participant burden (e.g., flexibility in data collection methods) might be most effective in maximising cohort retention.

Abstract Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis, which occurs most commonly in infants and toddlers. It is self-limited but prognosis depends on the development of coronary abnormalities. The aetiology is unknown, but recent research has shed some light on its pathogenesis. Epidemiologic data and clinical presentation suggest that it might be a bacterial or viral infection, but attempts to demonstrate a specific pathogen have failed so far. The possibility that a superantigen-driven process might take place in this disorder has been advocated by several groups. Ethnic preference for Asian populations and early age predilection all support a genetic predisposition. Immunological abnormalities of different kinds have also been demonstrated; therefore the current concept is that an immune-mediated pathogenesis in a genetically predisposed individual could be responsible for the disease development.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belot, Alexandre; Dauwalder, Olivier; Reumaux, H\u00E9lo\u00EFse; Cimaz, Rolando","journal":"Revue du Rhumatisme Monographies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae4242ed8d4274af11bd325adfd2ce783132f321.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878622711000968; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878622711000968","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the development","The possibility that","the disease development","maladie de Kawasaki","The aetiology is unknown","MK partage","maladie infectieuse","d\u00E9veloppement de la maladie","therefore the current concept is that an immune","mediated pathogenesis in","It is self-limited but prognosis depends","Abstract Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis","clinical presentation suggest that it might be","but recent research","but attempts to demonstrate","its pathogenesis","Asian populations","coronary abnormalities","Immunological abnormalities","origine de la vascularite","driven process might take place in this disorder","which occurs most commonly in infants","vascularite inflammatoire aigu\u00EB","genetically predisposed individual could be responsible","bacterial or viral infection","specific pathogen","also","demonstrated","superantigen","early age predilection","shed some light","nombreux signes","support","advocated","\u00E2ge p\u00E9diatrique","different kinds","diff\u00E9rentes hypoth\u00E8ses","maladies infectieuses virales","failed so far","participation de facteurs g\u00E9n\u00E9tiques","toddlers","genetic predisposition","survenue pr\u00E9coce","Ethnic preference","pronostic","derni\u00E8res ann\u00E9es","Epidemiologic","superantig\u00E8ne","several groups","compr\u00E9hension de la physiopathologie","pr\u00E9sentation clinique","atteinte coronarienne","travaux de recherche","d\u00E9s\u00E9quilibre immunologique","sujets","possibilit\u00E9","anomalies immunologiques","fr\u00E9quence augment\u00E9e","nourrisson"],"language":"fr"},

Virus sequence analyses from severe cases have shown presence of unique and highly conserved mutations in the helicase domain of genotype 1, 3 and 4 viruses. We evaluated role of two amino acid replacements (L1110F) and (V1120I); found to be frequent in genotype 1 FHF-E viruses from India. Three mutant helicase proteins (two with single point mutations and one with dual mutations) were expressed in Escherichia coli and evaluated for their ATPase and RNA unwinding activities. Both L1110F and V1120I helicase mutants showed marginal decrease in ATPase activity, while L1110F/V1120I dual mutant showed normal ATPase activity. All three mutants proteins showed RNA unwinding activities comparable to wild type protein. Corresponding mutations were made in the helicase domain of HEV RLuc replicon and replication efficiencies were tested in the S10-3 (Huh 7) cells. The mutant replicon V1120I showed lower replication as compared to L1110F and L1110F/V1120I mutants. However, all three replicon mutants showed lower replication efficiencies as compared to the wild type replicon. Walker A and Walker B motif mutant HEV replicons were unable to replicate indicating essential role of the virus encoded helicase domain during HEV replication. FHF-E associated helicase mutations resulted in only marginal decrease in the virus replication suggesting alternate function/s of the helicase protein.

A molecular survey was performed to determine the presence of a broad range of enteric viruses, namely chicken astrovirus (CAstV), avian nephritis virus (ANV), chicken parvovirus (ChPV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian rotavirus (AvRV), avian reovirus (ARV), and fowl adenovirus (FAdV), in intestinal samples derived from 34 commercial chicken flocks that experienced enteritis outbreaks between 2010 and 2012. Using techniques such as PCR and reverse-transcription PCR, enteric viruses were identified in a total of 85.3% of investigated commercial chicken flocks in Korea. Furthermore, diverse combinations of 2 or more enteric viruses were simultaneously identified in 51.7% of chicken farms positive for enteric viruses. The rank order of positivity for enteric viruses was as follows: ANV (44.1%), CAstV (38.2%), ChPV (26.5%), IBV (20.6%), ARV (8.8%), AvRV (5.9%), and FAdV (2.9%). Additionally, other pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Eimeria spp., and FAdV were detected in 79% of chicken flocks positive for enteric viruses using PCR, bacterial isolation, and microscopic examination. The results of our study indicate the presence of several enteric viruses with various combinations in commercial chicken farms that experienced enteritis outbreaks. Experimental studies are required to further understand the roles of enteric viruses in RSS in commercial chickens.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koo, B.S.; Lee, H.R.; Jeon, E.O.; Han, M.S.; Min, K.C.; Lee, S.B.; Mo, I.P.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e26ef8f5682aeee20ca0ae83fff0ac3533c1cef6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24135590/; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2013-03280; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119384007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119384007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSS","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of enteric viruses","broad range of enteric viruses","commercial chicken flocks","commercial chicken farms","chicken parvovirus","chicken astrovirus","chicken flocks positive","chicken farms positive","commercial chickens","FAdV","avian nephritis virus","avian rotavirus","avian reovirus","experienced enteritis outbreaks","presence","RSS","ANV","IBV","ChPV","CAstV","AvRV","reverse-transcription PCR","various combinations","diverse combinations","infectious bronchitis virus","stunting syndrome","potential causative agents of runting","attention","bacterial isolation","intestinal samples","Escherichia coli","Salmonella","Eimeria","fowl adenovirus","rank order of positivity","microscopic examination","pathogens","study","Korea","total","results","techniques","molecular survey","Experimental studies"],"language":"en"},

We performed a large-scale survey to investigate vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs), including anaphylaxis, in Japan by distributing questionnaires on VAAEs to veterinary hospitals from April 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007. Valid responses were obtained for 57,300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals; we obtained VAAEs information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital. We found that of the 57,300, 359 dogs showed VAAEs. Of the 359 dogs, death was observed in 1, anaphylaxis in 41, dermatological signs in 244, gastrointestinal signs in 160, and other signs in 106. Onset of VAAEs was mostly observed within 12h after vaccination (n =299, 83.3%). In this study, anaphylaxis events occurred within 60min after vaccination, and about half of these events occurred within 5min (n =19, 46.3%). Furthermore, where anaphylaxis was reported, additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation. Our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs; 27 of these demonstrated collapse (87.1%), 24 demonstrated cyanosis (77.4%), and both signs occurred in 22 (71.0%). Higher rates of animal VAAEs, anaphylaxis, and death were found in Japan than in other countries. Further investigations, including survey studies, will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for VAAEs, and thus develop safer vaccines. Moreover, it may also be necessary to continually update the data of VAAEs.","publish_time":"2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miyaji, Kazuki; Suzuki, Aki; Shimakura, Hidekatsu; Takase, Yukari; Kiuchi, Akio; Fujimura, Masato; Kurita, Goro; Tsujimoto, Hajime; Sakaguchi, Masahiro","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71b6afaa7643d4c907be458cac52106c5f5e193a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112591.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.12.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242712000037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264736/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242712000037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["VAAEs information","data of VAAEs","anaphylaxis events","Onset of VAAEs","vaccinated dogs","resurvey of dogs","Higher rates of animal VAAEs","death","vaccination","dermatological signs","gastrointestinal signs","animal hospitals","veterinary hospitals","adverse events","Japan","additional information","safer vaccines","survey studies","Valid responses","large-scale survey","demonstrated collapse","demonstrated cyanosis","Abstract Canine non-rabies combined vaccines","questionnaires","risk factors","important role","public health","animals","diagnosis","interaction","infectious agents","investigations","half","study","reinvestigation","countries"],"language":"en"},

Previous work has shown IDE plays an important role in VZV infection and virus cell-to-cell spread, which is the sole route for VZV spread in vitro. Here we report that a recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) enhances VZV infectivity at an early step of infection associated with an increase in virus internalization, and increases cell-to-cell spread. VZV mutants lacking the IDE binding domain of gE were impaired for syncytia formation and membrane fusion. Pre-treatment of cell-free VZV with rIDE markedly enhanced the stability of the virus over a range of conditions. rIDE interacted with gE to elicit a conformational change in gE and rendered it more susceptible to proteolysis. Co-incubation of rIDE with gE modified the size of gE. We propose that the conformational change in gE elicited by IDE enhances infectivity and stability of the virus and leads to increased fusogenicity during VZV infection. The ability of rIDE to enhance infectivity of cell-free VZV over a wide range of incubation times and temperatures suggests that rIDE may be useful for increasing the stability of varicella or zoster vaccines.","publish_time":"2010-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qingxue; Ali, Mir A.; Wang, Kening; Sayre, Dean; Hamel, Frederick G.; Fischer, Elizabeth R.; Bennett, Robert G.; Cohen, Jeffrey I.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17a5e67e3855ae5fa7d1a711f3249b6813c28386.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2892511.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20593027/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDE","VZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VZV infectivity","virus cell","VZV infection","free VZV","virus infectivity","infectivity of cell","VZV mutants","size of gE","IDE binding domain of gE","virus internalization","Pre-treatment of cell","ability of rIDE","Varicella-zoster virus","Co-incubation of rIDE","stability of varicella","recombinant soluble IDE","conformational change","early step of infection","wide range of incubation times","range of conditions","zoster vaccines","unique amino terminal extracellular domain","temperatures","glycoprotein E","important role","syncytia formation","cellular receptor","insulin","enzyme","increased fusogenicity","membrane fusion","Previous work","sole route","proteolysis"],"language":"en"},

By using CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor, we achieved single molecule sensitivity for the detection of ST (0.54 aM) and SFTS (0.63 aM); this detection sensitivity is 100 times more sensitive than that of RT-PCR assay.

Along the way have come insights into host innate and adaptive immune responses and the many ways in which viruses antagonize these responses while exploiting other cellular processes to their advantage. The sequencing of the human genome, however, dramatically changed the field of viral pathogenesis. Virologists are now able to move beyond virus-centric or single-gene approaches and instead investigate the host response to infection on a genome-wide scale. In this chapter, we focus on the insights into viral pathogenesis that are provided by examining the host transcriptional response, including the dynamics of innate and acquired immunity, diagnostic signatures, and the identification of targets for antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korth, Marcus J.; Law, G.

Despite this lengthy interval, implementation of specific quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests in the US has been slow, and testing is still not widely available. Metagenomic sequencing offers the promise of unbiased detection of emerging pathogens, without requiring prior knowledge of the identity of the responsible agent or its genomic sequence. METHODS To evaluate metagenomic approaches in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, laboratory-confirmed positive and negative samples from Seattle, Washington were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing, with comparison to a 2019 reference genomic database created before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Within 36 hours our results showed clear identification of a novel human Betacoronavirus, closely related to known Betacoronaviruses of bats, in laboratory-proven cases of SARS-CoV-2. A subset of samples also showed superinfection or colonization with human parainfluenza virus 3 or Moraxella species, highlighting the need to test directly for SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to ruling out an infection using a viral respiratory panel. Samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were also negative by metagenomic analysis, and positive for Rhinovirus A and C. Unlike targeted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR testing, metagenomic analysis of these SARS-CoV-2 negative samples identified candidate etiological agents for the patients\u0027 respiratory symptoms.

This study aims to screen comprehensively for CLEC4M variants and investigate their association with type 1 VWD in the Swedish population. In order to screen for CLEC4M variants, the CLEC4M gene region was re-sequenced and the polymorphic neck region was genotyped in 106 type 1 VWD patients from unrelated type 1 VWD families. Single nucleotide variants (SNV) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) allele and genotype frequencies were then compared with 294 individuals from the 1000Genomes project and 436 Swedish control individuals. Re-sequencing identified a total of 42 SNVs. Rare variants showed no accumulation in type 1 VWD patients and are not thought to contribute substantially to type 1 VWD. The only missense mutation (rs2277998, NP_001138379.1:p.Asp224Asn) had a higher frequency in type 1 VWD patients than in controls (4.9%). The VNTR genotypes 57 and 67 were observed at higher frequencies than expected in type 1 VWD patients (6.4% and 6.2%) and showed an increase in patients compared with controls (7.4% and 3.1%). Strong linkage disequilibrium in the CLEC4M region makes it difficult to distinguish between the effect of the missense mutation and the VNTR genotypes. In conclusion, heterozygous VNTR genotypes 57 and 67 of CLEC4M were highly enriched and are the most likely mechanism through which CLEC4M contributes to disease in the Swedish type 1 VWD population.","publish_time":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manderstedt, Eric; Lind-Halld\u00E9n, Christina; Lethagen, Stefan; Halld\u00E9n, Christer","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/356b49eeee107ff0397b374e29cdd8f133b2688f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5794141.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389944/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Willebrand"],"organizations":["VWD","VNTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VWD patients","Swedish type","CLEC4M variants","VWD population","CLEC4M region","unrelated type","VWD families","CLEC4M gene region","heterozygous VNTR genotypes","Rare variants","Swedish population","Swedish control individuals","VWF","healthy individuals","Single nucleotide variants","Willebrand disease","higher frequencies","missense mutation","controls","polymorphic neck region","higher frequency","Re-sequencing","Willebrand factor","genotype frequencies","variable number tandem repeat","allele","levels","NP","Genomes project","accumulation","genes","Asp224Asn","rs2277998","ABO","Strong linkage disequilibrium","association","likely mechanism","genetic variation","total","effect","conclusion","STXBP5","SNVs","increase","order","study"],"language":"en"},

Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.","publish_time":"2011-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsetsarkin, Konstantin A.; Weaver, Scott C.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e3925148a778080ac13f3f532ee63ae24a3d1e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3234230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174678/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002412","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIK"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["CHIKV fitness","ability of CHIKV","E2-L210Q","initial step of CHIKV adaptation","continuous CHIKV circulation","subsequent CHIKV evolution","Aedes albopictus mosquito","albopictus-human cycle","initial adaptive substitution","step adaptive mutations","step mutation","A226V amino acid substitution","albopictus midgut epithelial cells","E1 envelope glycoprotein","E1-A226V","efficient virus circulation","stronger effect","adaptation of Chikungunya virus","nature","selection","additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change","alternative mosquito vector","new vector","level of infection","disseminated infection","infectious viruses","expanded CHIK epidemics","observed time differences","series of large-scale epidemics of arthritic disease","aegypti","selective sweeps","ongoing re-emergence","endemic areas","major factor","risk","persistence","Kerala","replicon particles","arthropod","significant increase","parts","vertebrate cell lines","India","results","residues","little attention","world","geographic locations"],"language":"en"},

Seventy-nine PE practitioners working predominantly in Africa, Asia and Europe (29, 22 and 18 respectively) contributed to the email discussion forum. They proposed various modifications to the existing PE definition and discussed different issues related to the applicatoin of PE, its institutionalization for use in policy development, as well as the priorities for future development. The need to increase the number of PE trained people together with some methodological developments and the application of this methodology in developed countries, were some of the points highlighted during the forum.

In this study, a BRSV fluorogenic reverse transcription PCR (fRT-PCR) assay, based on TaqMan principle, was developed and evaluated on a large number of clinical samples, representing various cases of natural and experimental BRSV infections. By using a single-step closed-tube format, the turn-around time was shortened drastically and results were obtained with minimal risk for cross-contamination. According to comparative analyses, the detection limit of the fRT-PCR was on the same level as that of a nested PCR and the sensitivity relatively higher than that of a conventional PCR, antigen ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and virus isolation (VI). Interspersed negative control samples, samples from healthy animals and eight symptomatically or genetically related viruses were all negative, confirming a high specificity of the assay.

In order to characterize in detail the temporal and geographic relationships among PEDV strains, the present study systematically evaluated the evolutionary patterns and phylogenetic resolution in each gene of the whole PEDV genome in order to determine which regions provided the maximal interpretative power. The result was further applied to identify the origin of PEDV that caused the 2014 epidemic in Taiwan. Thirty-four full genome sequences were downloaded from GenBank and divided into three non-mutually exclusive groups, namely, worldwide, Genogroup 2 and China, to cover different ranges of secular and spatial trends. Each dataset was then divided into different alignments by different genes for likelihood mapping and phylogenetic analysis. Our study suggested that both nsp3 and S genes contained the highest phylogenetic signal with substitution rate and phylogenetic topology similar to those obtained from the complete genome. Furthermore, the proportion of nodes with high posterior support (posterior probability \u003E 0.8) was similar between nsp3 and S genes. The nsp3 gene sequences from three clinical samples of swine with PEDV infections were aligned with other strains available from GenBank and the results suggested that the virus responsible for the 2014 PEDV outbreak in Taiwan clustered together with Clade I from the US within Genogroup 2. In conclusion, the current study identified the nsp3 gene as an alternative marker for a rapid and unequivocal classification of the circulating PEDV strains which provides complementary information to the S gene in identifying the emergence of epidemic strain resulting from recombination.","publish_time":"2015-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Ming-Hua; Deng, Ming-Chung; Chung, Yi-Hsuan; Huang, Yu-Liang; Chang, Chia-Yi; Lan, Yu-Ching; Chou, Hsin-Lin; Chao, Day-Yu","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/136eb8ca0c1420b21582827d1aaf78a8cd7082f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106162.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134815003780; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.09.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134815003780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Unites States","Taiwan","China"],"keyphrases":["PEDV genome","PEDV infections","PEDV outbreak","origin of PEDV","circulating PEDV strains","nsp3 gene sequences","different genes","S genes","new variant of PEDV","Genogroup","Taiwan","phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic resolution","genome sequences","phylogenetic topology similar","highest phylogenetic signal","different alignments","strains available","present study","current study","GenBank","complete genome","order","China","different ranges of secular","posterior probability","high posterior support","emergence of epidemic strain","substitution rate","unequivocal classification","likelihood mapping","clinical samples of swine","complementary information","alternative marker","evolutionary patterns","regions","results","temporal","proportion of nodes","geographic relationships","spatial trends","virus responsible","Clade","maximal interpretative power","recombination","States","Asian countries","exclusive groups","conclusion","dataset"],"language":"en"},

Global change refers to environmental changes arising from human activities affecting the fundamental mechanisms operating in the biosphere. This paper discusses the changes observed in recent times with regard to some important arboviral (arthropod-borne viral) diseases of animals, and the role global change could have played in these variations. Two of the most important arboviral diseases of animals, bluetongue (BT) and West Nile fever/encephalitis (WNF), have been selected as models. In both cases, in the last 15 years an important leap forward has been observed, which has lead to considering them emerging diseases in different parts of the world. BT, affecting domestic ruminants, has recently afflicted livestock in Europe in an unprecedented epizootic, causing enormous economic losses. WNF affects wildlife (birds), domestic animals (equines), and humans, thus, beyond the economic consequences of its occurrence, as a zoonotic disease, it poses an important public health threat. West Nile virus (WNV) has expanded in the last 12 years worldwide, and particularly in the Americas, where it first occurred in 1999, extending throughout the Americas relentlessly since then, causing a severe epidemic of disastrous consequences for public health, wildlife, and livestock. In Europe, WNV is known long time ago, but it is since the last years of the twentieth century that its incidence has risen substantially. Circumstances such as global warming, changes in land use and water management, increase in travel, trade of animals, and others, can have an important influence in the observed changes in both diseases.

As evidence-based information on COVID-19 continues to emerge, this manuscript serves as a means to disseminate the current opinions and management strategies of a variety of experts in OMS.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Tim T.; Moon, Hwi Sean; Le, Anh; Panchal, Neeraj","journal":"J Oral Maxillofac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f7582b9769bdb8d67fa6b0da50a6f5ae946fc8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211734.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422192/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278239120304560; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2020.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278239120304560?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","maxillofacial surgery","OMSs","practice of oral","maxillofacial surgeons","pandemic","Response Conference","public health challenge","global health crisis","management strategies","recent memory","administrators","current opinions","variety of experts","multiple institutions","forum","healthcare services","means","delivery","potential","world","evidence-based information","unprecedented ways","CoronaVirus Disease","manuscript","specialty"],"language":"en"},

Approximately one-half of CNS infections remain of undetermined origin. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) brought new perspectives to CNS infection investigations, allowing investigation of viral aetiologies with an unbiased approach. HTS use is still limited to specific clinical situations. Objectives The aim of this review was to evaluate the contribution and pitfalls of HTS for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis in CNS patient samples. Sources PubMed was searched from 1 January 2008 to 2 August 2018 to retrieve available studies on the topic. Additional publications were included from a review of full-text sources. Content Among 366 studies retrieved, 29 used HTS as a diagnostic technique. HTS was performed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy samples of 307 patients, including immunocompromised, immunocompetent paediatric, and adult cases. HTS was performed retrospectively in 18 studies and prospectively in 11. HTS led to the identification of a potential causal virus in 41 patients, with 11 viruses known and ten not expected to cause CNS infections. Various HTS protocols were used. Implications The additional value of HTS is difficult to quantify because of various biases. Nevertheless, HTS led to the identification of a viral cause in 13% of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis cases in which various assays failed to identify the cause. HTS should be considered early in clinical management as a complement to routine assays. Standardized strategies and systematic studies are needed for the integration of HTS in clinical management.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zanella, M.-C.; Lenggenhager, L.; Schrenzel, J.; Cordey, S.; Kaiser, L.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a671fa18adf73f23571f4f89ac7bd7aa7ddf9832.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30641229/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.12.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X18308127; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X18308127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used HTS","integration of HTS","pitfalls of HTS","HTS use","Various HTS protocols","additional value of HTS","viral cause","one-half of CNS infections","CNS patient samples","aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis","clinical management","various assays","systematic studies","available studies","investigation of viral aetiologies","CNS infection investigations","patients","meningoencephalitis","meningitis cases","Abstract Background Viral aetiologies","review","various biases","specific clinical situations","common cause of central nervous system","adult cases","routine assays","Additional publications","text sources","Sources PubMed","brain biopsy samples","new perspectives","cerebrospinal fluid","potential causal virus","High-throughput sequencing","complement","unbiased approach","undetermined origin","Standardized strategies","diagnostic technique","Implications","contribution","Objectives","aim","topic","viruses","Content"],"language":"en"},

The antibody is unique to humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, and it binds specifically to a mammalian carbohydrate antigen called the \u03B1-gal epitope that is synthesized in nonprimate mammals, lemurs (prosimians) and New World monkeys by the glycosylation enzyme \u03B11,3GT. The \u03B11,3GT gene (GGTA1) appeared in mammals \u003E100 million years ago, prior to the split between marsupial and placental mammals. This gene has been conserved in its active form, in all mammals, except for Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Inactivation of the \u03B11,3GT gene in ancestral Old World primates occurred 20\u201330 million years ago and could have been associated with epidemics of enveloped viruses in the Eurasia-Africa continent. It is suggested that prior to such epidemics, few ancestral Old World primates acquired deletion point mutations that inactivated the \u03B11,3GT gene and eliminated \u03B1-gal epitopes. This resulted in loss of immune tolerance to the \u03B1-gal epitope and thus, in production of the anti-Gal antibody against antigens on bacteria colonizing the GI tract. This accidental inactivation of the \u03B11,3GT gene in very small populations is analogous to the highly rare blood type \u201CBombay\u201D individuals who do not synthesize blood group H (O antigen) because of inactivation of the \u03B11,2-fucosyltransferase gene. The loss of immune tolerance to blood group H antigen has resulted in production of natural anti-blood group H antibodies in the blood group Bombay individuals. It is suggested that anti-Gal protected against infections by enveloped viruses presenting \u03B1-gal epitopes, which were lethal to the parental primate populations that conserved active \u03B11,3GT and thus, synthesized \u03B1-gal epitopes. Alternative causes for the elimination of Old World primates synthesizing \u03B1-gal epitopes could be bacteria or protozoa parasites presenting \u03B1-gal or \u03B1-gal-like epitopes, and bacterial toxins, or detrimental viruses that used \u03B1-gal epitopes in these primates as \u201Cdocking receptors.\u201D Ultimately, any of these proposed selective processes could result in extinction of Old World primates synthesizing \u03B1-gal epitopes on their cells. These ancestral primates were replaced by offspring populations lacking \u03B1-gal epitopes and producing the anti-Gal antibody, which continues to be produced by Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. New World monkeys and lemurs were protected from pathogens of the Old World by oceanic barriers, thus they continue to synthesize \u03B1-gal epitopes and lack the ability to produce the anti-Gal antibody. This scenario of few individuals in a large population having a mutation(s) that inactivates a glycosyltransferase gene thus, resulting in production of evolutionary advantageous natural antibodies against the eliminated carbohydrate antigen, may reflect one of the mechanisms inducing changes in the carbohydrate profile of various mammalian populations.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galili, Uri","journal":"The Natural Anti-Gal Antibody As Foe Turned Friend In Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39dfec033bec1b37ec074098d089148a1ab1062f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150209.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128133620000026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128133620000026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eliminated \u03B1-gal epitopes","synthesized \u03B1-gal epitopes","natural anti-Gal antibody","Old World monkeys","ancestral Old World primates","extinction of Old World primates","elimination of Old World primates","GT gene","New World monkeys","ancestral primates","active \u03B11","production of natural anti-blood group H antibodies","blood group H antigen","multiple natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies","humans","glycosyltransferase gene","fucosyltransferase gene","eliminated carbohydrate antigen","mammalian carbohydrate antigen","blood group Bombay individuals","glycosylation enzyme \u03B11","apes","carbohydrate profile of various mammalian populations","offspring populations","O antigen","small populations","GI bacteria","nonprimate mammals","placental mammals","production of evolutionary advantageous natural antibodies","rare blood type","epidemics of enveloped viruses","wide range of carbohydrate antigens","detrimental viruses","parental primate populations","loss of immune tolerance","lemurs","accidental inactivation","years","GI tract","active form","deletion point mutations","prosimians","protozoa parasites","pathogens","infections","large population","ability","bacterial toxins","changes","Eurasia-Africa continent","split","GGTA1","Alternative causes","proposed selective processes","oceanic barriers","mechanisms","cells","scenario","receptors"],"language":"en"},

The high degree of homology within the protease\u2019s active site and substrate conservation supports the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds. A previous study identified the compound ML188, also termed 16R, as an inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL(pro). This study will detail the generation of a homology model of the 3CL(pro) of the human coronavirus OC43 and determine the potential of 16R to form a broad-spectrum lead compound. MODELLER was used to generate a suitable three-dimensional model of the OC43 3CL(pro) and the Prime module of Schr\u04E7dinger predicted the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16R within the 3CL(pro) active site. Molecular dynamics further confirmed ligand stability and hydrogen bonding networks. RESULTS: A high quality homology model of the OC43 3CL(pro) was successfully generated in an active conformation. Further studies reproduced the binding pose of 16R within the active site of the generated model, where its free energy of binding was shown to equal that of the 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit. The stability of the ligand was subsequently confirmed by molecular dynamics. CONCLUSION: The lead compound 16R may represent a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the 3CL(pro) of OC43 and potentially other coronaviruses. This study provides an atomistic structure of the 3CL(pro) of OC43 and supports further experimental validation of the inhibitory effects of 16R. These findings further confirm that the 3CL(pro) of coronaviruses can be inhibited by broad spectrum lead compounds.","publish_time":"2015-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Michael; Fielding, Burtram; Gamieldien, Junaid","journal":"BMC Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03fa4232b3fbc44b6029d52c3120f4e82fdc49c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4411765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25928480/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12900-015-0035-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human coronavirus OC43","binding conformation","generated model","active conformation","broad-spectrum lead compound","free energy of binding","protease\u2019s active site","high quality homology model","SARS-CoV","ligand stability","high degree of homology","suitable three-dimensional model","compound ML188","broad-spectrum inhibitor","Molecular dynamics","compounds","previous study","coronaviruses","identification of broad spectrum","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","design of potential anticoronavirus inhibitors","substrate conservation","Prime module of Schr\u04E7dinger","validated target","hydrogen bonding networks","experimental validation","RESULTS","inhibitory effects","chymotrypsin","generation","CONCLUSION","atomistic structure","BACKGROUND","receptor","MODELLER","studies","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, it is not known how viruses encoding large viral RNA genomes such as the Coronaviridae (26 to 32 kb) balance the requirements for genome stability and quasispecies diversity. Further, the limits of replication infidelity during replication of large RNA genomes and how decreased fidelity impacts virus fitness over time are not known. Our previous work demonstrated that genetic inactivation of the coronavirus exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of murine hepatitis virus results in a 15-fold decrease in replication fidelity. However, it is not known whether nsp14-ExoN is required for replication fidelity of all coronaviruses, nor the impact of decreased fidelity on genome diversity and fitness during replication and passage. We report here the engineering and recovery of nsp14-ExoN mutant viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that have stable growth defects and demonstrate a 21-fold increase in mutation frequency during replication in culture. Analysis of complete genome sequences from SARS-ExoN mutant viral clones revealed unique mutation sets in every genome examined from the same round of replication and a total of 100 unique mutations across the genome. Using novel bioinformatic tools and deep sequencing across the full-length genome following 10 population passages in vitro, we demonstrate retention of ExoN mutations and continued increased diversity and mutational load compared to wild-type SARS-CoV. The results define a novel genetic and bioinformatics model for introduction and identification of multi-allelic mutations in replication competent viruses that will be powerful tools for testing the effects of decreased fidelity and increased quasispecies diversity on viral replication, pathogenesis, and evolution.","publish_time":"2010-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eckerle, Lance D.; Becker, Michelle M.; Halpin, Rebecca A.; Li, Kelvin; Venter, Eli; Lu, Xiaotao; Scherbakova, Sana; Graham, Rachel L.; Baric, Ralph S.; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Spiro, David J.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4007988dba3dcfa65314d50324bdff1ba7f55c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2865531.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20463816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome replication","replication fidelity","viral replication","genome diversity","round of replication","replication competent viruses","replication of large RNA genomes","nsp14-ExoN","limits of replication infidelity","full-length genome","genome stability","increased diversity","RNA viruses","increased quasispecies diversity","retention of ExoN mutations","effects of decreased fidelity","impact of decreased fidelity","unique mutations","SARS-ExoN mutant viral clones","decreased fidelity impacts virus fitness","large viral RNA genomes","Analysis of complete genome sequences","correct mutations","ExoN mutant viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recovery of nsp14","pathogenesis","identification of multi-allelic mutations","wild-type SARS-CoV","novel bioinformatic tools","coronavirus exoribonuclease","genetic inactivation","mutation frequency","powerful tools","murine hepatitis virus results","fold increase","fold decrease","introduction","bioinformatics model","deep sequencing","mutational load","nonstructural protein","time","population passages","mechanisms","total","requirements","coronaviruses","stable growth defects","previous work","engineering","culture","Coronaviridae","evolution","adaptation"],"language":"en"},

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) is a DUB that cleaves ISG15, a two domain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUb(Lys48) products. To elucidate this specificity, we report the 2.85 \u00C5 crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb(Lys48) activity-based probe. SARS PLpro binds diUb(Lys48) in an extended conformation via two contact sites, S1 and S2, which are proximal and distal to the active site, respectively. We show that specificity for polyUb(Lys48) chains is predicated on contacts in the S2 site and enhanced by an S1\u2013S1\u2032 preference for a Lys48 linkage across the active site. In contrast, ISG15 specificity is dominated by contacts in the S1 site.

Ancient African pathogen genome data can provide novel revelations concerning human\u2010pathogen coevolutionary processes, and such knowledge is essential for forecasting the ways in which emerging zoonotic and increasingly transmissible diseases might influence human demography and longevity in the future.","publish_time":"2017-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rifkin, Riaan F.; Potgieter, Marnie; Ramond, Jean\u2010Baptiste; Cowan, Don A.","journal":"Evol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84efaac896e551763256fd4d16e56a99b416c175.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5680625.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["human demography","human lineage","human mortality","human evolutionary processes","temporal depth of human occupation","discovery of ancient pathogenic drivers","ancient pathogenic DNA","pathogen coevolutionary processes","Ancient African pathogen genome data","novel revelations","impact of pathogens","bacterial pathogens","recent discovery","sub\u2010Saharan Africa","strategic role","significance of novel information","prominent role of viral","remarkable insight","malignant neoplastic lesions date","ancestral hominin disease pathology","knowledge","oncogenesis","point of departure","transmissible diseases","longevity","Early Pleistocene examples","antiquity of cancer","ways","years","future","Shakespearean vernacular","region"],"language":"en"},

Most felids are susceptible to FIV, but humans are not. Feline immunodeficiency virus is endemic in domestic cat populations worldwide. The virus loses infectivity quickly outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants. Infection Feline immunodeficiency virus is transmitted via bites. The risk of transmission is low in households with socially well-adapted cats. Transmission from mother to kittens may occur, especially if the queen is undergoing an acute infection. Cats with FIV are persistently infected in spite of their ability to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Disease signs Infected cats generally remain free of clinical signs for several years, and some cats never develop disease, depending on the infecting isolate. Most clinical signs are the consequence of immunodeficiency and secondary infection. Typical manifestations are chronic gingivostomatitis, chronic rhinitis, lymphadenopathy, weight loss and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis Positive in-practice ELISA results obtained in a low-prevalence or low-risk population should always be confirmed by a laboratory. Western blot is the \u2018gold standard\u2019 laboratory test for FIV serology. PCR-based assays vary in performance. Disease management Cats should never be euthanased solely on the basis of an FIV-positive test result. Cats infected with FIV may live as long as uninfected cats, with appropriate management. Asymptomatic FIV-infected cats should be neutered to avoid fighting and virus transmission. Infected cats should receive regular veterinary health checks. They can be housed in the same ward as other patients, but should be kept in individual cages. Vaccination recommendations At present, there is no FIV vaccine commercially available in Europe. Potential benefits and risks of vaccinating FIV-infected cats should be assessed on an individual cat basis. Needles and surgical instruments used on FIV-positive cats may transmit the virus to other cats, so strict hygiene is essential.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosie, Margaret J.; Addie, Diane; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64b06251c5c81f276a0a536dca9bf9cdd5997bf3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481037/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09001181; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09001181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["FIV-positive cats","Asymptomatic FIV-infected cats","uninfected cats","risks of vaccinating FIV-infected cats","Disease signs Infected cats","Disease management Cats","FIV vaccine","FIV serology","virus transmission","well-adapted cats","Infection Feline immunodeficiency virus","human immunodeficiency virus","FIV-positive test result","Abstract Overview Feline immunodeficiency virus","consequence of immunodeficiency","risk of transmission","low-prevalence","Diagnosis Positive","free of clinical signs","low-risk population","laboratory test","secondary infection","individual cat basis","acute infection","immune-mediated glomerulonephritis","chronic rhinitis","chronic gingivostomatitis","immune responses","appropriate management","individual cages","domestic cat populations","weight loss","lymphadenopathy","gold standard","households","practice ELISA results","antibody","retrovirus","regular veterinary health checks","Typical manifestations","surgical instruments","cell","present","Potential benefits","host","years","strict hygiene","PCR-based assays","performance","ability","Western blot","spite","Europe","Needles","bites","Vaccination recommendations","disinfectants","mother","kittens","queen","infecting isolate","infectivity","felids","humans","ward","patients"],"language":"en"},

The 3\u0027-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3\u2032-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.","publish_time":"1989-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42d26dca475f7ed425736dd116365ed395afe23a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900603; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of UCUAA repeats","MHV recombinant viruses","different numbers of UCUAA repeats","variant viruses","leader sequence of MHV genome","different MHV strains","fewer repeats","discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs","serial passages of viruses","intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses","nucleotides of leader sequences","leader-primed transcription mechanism","agreement","genomic RNA","RNA replication","pentanucleotide","nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis","subgenomic mRNAs of murine coronavirus","synthesis of certain mRNA species","crucial roles","occurrence","high frequency","higher growth rate","deletion","susceptible cells","Analysis","homologous interference","stretch","downward evolution","finding","ease","region","end","present study"],"language":"en"},

In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial.

The aims of this study were to analyse the potential correlations between the risk of developing recurrent wheezing and the presence of specific polymorphisms of some genes regulating immune system function, and to study the relative importance of the associations of different viruses and genetic polymorphisms in causing recurrent episodes. METHODS: The study involved 119 otherwise healthy infants admitted to hospital for a first episode of wheezing (74 of whom subsequently experienced recurrent episodes) and 119 age- and sex-matched subjects without any history of respiratory problem randomly selected from those attending our outpatient clinic during the study period. All of the study subjects were followed up for two years, and 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 33 candidate genes were genotyped on whole blood using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT Fast Real-time instrument. RESULTS: IL8-rs4073AT, VEGFA-rs833058CT, MBL2-rs1800450CT and IKBKB-rs3747811AT were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing wheezing (p = 0.02, p = 0.03, p = 0.05 and p = 0.0018), whereas CTLA4-rs3087243AG and NFKBIB-rs3136641TT were associated with a significantly reduced risk (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04). IL8-rs4073AT, VEGFA-rs2146323AA and NFKBIA-rs2233419AG were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing recurrent wheezing (p = 0.04, p = 0.04 and p = 0.03), whereas TLR3-rs3775291TC was associated with a significantly reduced risk (p = 0.03). Interestingly, the study of gene-environment interactions showed that rhinovirus was significantly associated with recurrent wheezing in the presence of IL4Ra-rs1801275GG and G (odds ratio [OR] 6.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-30.10, p = 0.03) and MAP3K1-rs702689AA (OR 4.09, 95% CI: 1.14-14.61, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a clear relationship between the risk of wheezing and polymorphisms of some genes involved in the immune response. Although further studies are needed to confirm the results, these findings may be useful for the early identification of children at the highest risk of developing recurrent episodes and possibly subsequent asthma.","publish_time":"2014-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Ierardi, Valentina; Daleno, Cristina; Scala, Alessia; Terranova, Leonardo; Tagliabue, Claudia; Rios, Walter Peves; Pelucchi, Claudio; Principi, Nicola","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36c1c6bc314487fe898f76a7093175d90347ac20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4210469.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2466-14-162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of wheezing","recurrent wheezing","increased risk of developing wheezing","episode of wheezing","reduced risk","study subjects","highest risk","study of gene","study period","different wheezing phenotypes","experienced recurrent episodes","genetic polymorphisms","presence of specific polymorphisms","single nucleotide polymorphisms","candidate genes","IL8-rs4073AT","RESULTS","VEGFA-rs833058CT","VEGFA-rs2146323AA","presence of IL4Ra","early life","immune response","associations of different viruses","early identification of children","sex-matched subjects","immune system function","ABI PRISM","age","MBL2-rs1800450CT","HT Fast Real-time instrument","rs1801275GG","blood","SNPs","reasons","rhinovirus","clear relationship","odds ratio","IKBKB-rs3747811AT","history of respiratory problem","common disorder","relative importance","NFKBIA-rs2233419AG","environment interactions","hospital","years","NFKBIB-rs3136641TT","CTLA4-rs3087243AG","potential correlations","findings","outpatient clinic","healthy infants","subsequent asthma","confidence interval","BACKGROUND","MAP3K1-rs702689AA","TLR3-rs3775291TC","CONCLUSIONS","studies","aims","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We selected 114 candidate SNPs from 12 antiviral genes using an LD tagSNP selection approach and genotyped them in a cohort of 738 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of rubella vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and rubella virus-specific immune measures were assessed using linear regression methodologies. We identified 23 significant associations (p\u003C0.05) between polymorphisms within the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene cluster, and rubella virus-specific IL-2, IL-10, IL-6 secretion and antibody levels. The minor allele variants of three OAS1 SNPs (rs3741981/Ser162Gly, rs1051042/Thr361Arg, rs2660), located in a linkage disequilibrium block of functional importance, were significantly associated with an increase in rubella virus-specific IL-2/Th1 response (p\u22640.024). Seven OAS1 and OAS3 promoter/regulatory SNPs were similarly associated with IL-2 secretion. Importantly, two SNPs (rs3741981 and rs10774670), independently cross-regulated rubella virus-specific IL-10 secretion levels (p\u22640.031). Furthermore, both global tests and individual haplotype analyses revealed significant associations between OAS1 haplotypes and rubella virus-specific cytokine secretion.

Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, intracellular pH, and influenza virus protein acid (PA) polymerase subunit were detected with confocal microscopy and real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Jinchai significantly reduced the expression of HA and PA polymerase subunit mRNA in infected MDCK cells. Jinchai also significantly decreased intracellular pH in infected cells. Conclusions Jinchai had strong anti-influenza activity against the influenza virus. It weakened the ability of the influenza virus to adsorb to cell wall and fuse with cell membranes in the early infection stage, and inhibited the transcription and replication of the virus.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Juying; Cui, Xiaolan; Shi, Yujing; Gao, Yingjie; Cao, Hongxin","journal":"Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43cf52300556277bd1fee20aacf02351f38c1675.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254627213601259; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0254627213601259","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hemagglutinin"],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","HA","PA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus of Jinchai","influenza virus protein acid","FM1 strain of influenza virus","Conclusions Jinchai","infected cells","Results Jinchai","infected MDCK cells","cell membranes","cell adsorption","cell wall","strong anti-influenza activity","PA polymerase subunit mRNA","cell membrane fusion","transcription","intracellular pH","replication","expression of HA","real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction","confocal microscopy","capsule","Methods Madin-darby canine kidney","early infection stage","fuse","effect","Traditional Chinese Medicine","subtype H1N1","Hemagglutinin","Abstract Objective","ability"],"language":"en"},

The molecular weight of the polysaccharide and polydispersity was estimated to be 1.5 \u00D7 10(3) and 1.18, respectively. Although the fructan did not show anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro, it demonstrated an inhibitory effect on virus replication in vivo when it was orally administered to mice. In addition, the polysaccharide enhanced the production of neutralising antibodies against influenza A virus. Therefore, the antiviral mechanism of the polysaccharide seemed to be dependent on the host immune system, i.e., enhancement of the host immune function was achieved by the administration of the polysaccharide. From our observations, the fructan from Welsh onions is suggested to be one of the active principles which exert an anti-influenza virus effect.","publish_time":"2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jung-Bum; Miyake, Sachi; Umetsu, Ryo; Hayashi, Kyoko; Chijimatsu, Takeshi; Hayashi, Toshimitsu","journal":"Food Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58bf5ec29d28cb82c29ddda75f08a22a0d689891.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173106.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030881461200653X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442670/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030881461200653X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fructan","polysaccharide","anti-influenza virus effect","virus substance","virus activity","virus replication","linked \u03B2-d","host immune function","host immune system","Fruf residues","Glcp residues","Welsh onions","inhibitory effect","enhancement","hot water extract","production of neutralising antibodies","active principles","Allium fistulosum","polydispersity","molecular weight","administration","observations","spectroscopic analyses","antiviral mechanism","addition","structure","terminal","mice"],"language":"en"},

Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared. Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease. The design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases, as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease outcome.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Brand, J.M.A.; Haagmans, B.

The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts to control infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pharaon, Joe; Bauch, Chris T.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58bc0f2712ea1ced1f886c9fdd17b8cf014e66cb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/267d182ac832f63c9cc4075e58cd68289708fc39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/293936","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent strain","resident strain","resident pathogen strain","virulent mutant strain","adaptive social behaviour","perceived severities of pathogen strains","invasion analysis","influence of social behaviour","respective strains","human behaviour","protective behaviour","Infectious disease interventions","disease control","perceived severity","social processes","mathematical models of competition","differing virulence","infectious diseases","disease dynamics","emergence of virulent pathogens","population","efficacy of infection control","phase plane analysis","time series analysis","compartmental Susceptible-Infectious","higher virulence","prevalence of infection","differing natural history profiles","vaccination","lower basic reproductive number","contact precautions","plausible epidemiological scenarios","differential equation","public health efforts","individuals","certain applications","elimination","results","success","situations","objective","priority"],"language":"en"},

To assess the effect of IL-13 on primary RSV infection, transgenic mice which either overexpress IL-13 in the lung (IL-13 OE) or nontransgenic littermates (IL-13 NT) were challenged intranasally with RSV. IL-13 OE mice had significantly decreased peak viral titers four days after infection compared to non-transgenic littermates. In addition, the IL-13 OE mice had significantly lower RSV-induced weight loss and reduced lung IFN-\u03B3 protein expression compared with IL-13 NT mice. In contrast, primary RSV challenge of IL-13 deficient mice resulted in a small, but statistically significant increase in viral titers on day four after infection, no difference in RSV-induced weight loss compared to wild type mice, and augmented IFN-\u03B3 production on day 6 after infection. In STAT1-deficient (STAT1 KO) mice, where primary RSV challenge produced high levels of IL-13 production in the lungs, treatment with an IL-13 neutralizing protein resulted in greater peak viral titers both four and six days after RSV and greater RSV-induced weight loss compared to mice treated with a control protein. These results suggest that IL-13 modulates illness from RSV-infection.","publish_time":"2006-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Weisong; Hashimoto, Koichi; Moore, Martin L.; Elias, Jack A.; Zhu, Zhou; Durbin, Joan; Colasurdo, Giuseppe; Rutigliano, John A.; Chiappetta, Constance L.; Goleniewska, Kasia; O\u2019Neal, Jamye F.; Graham, Barney S.; Peebles, R.

Phylogenetic analysis using the complete genomes of PDCoVs detected in Japan in 2014 demonstrated that the PDCoVs from Japan may be closely related to the PDCoVs from the U.S. and Korea during 2013 to 2014 but not the PDCoVs from China and Hong Kong during 2004 to 2016 and from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos during 2015 to 2016. To investigate the pathogenicity of a representative Japanese PDCoV, we performed an experimental infection using hysterectomy-produced colostrum-deprived piglets. The PDCoV-inoculated piglets showed acute, watery diarrhoea, but all recovered and survived. In addition, all piglets inoculated with the Japanese PDCoV exhibited virus shedding at high level in faeces and viremia corresponding to their clinical symptoms. In the PDCoV-inoculated group, viruses were mainly detected from jejunums to colons by a quantitative PDCoV-specific PCR and microscopic observation. These findings would provide useful information for establishing a diagnostic methodology for distinguishing diarrhoea caused by PDCoV from that caused by other enteric pathogens, such as PEDV.","publish_time":"2018-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Tohru; Shibahara, Tomoyuki; Imai, Naoto; Yamamoto, Takehisa; Ohashi, Seiichi","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9b139ba557d4dc24893e66f01cb9a91d95c24af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172274.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818301722; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818301722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29621617/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Japan","U.S.","China","Hong Kong","Thailand","Vietnam","Laos"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV-inoculated piglets","PDCoV-inoculated group","representative Japanese PDCoV","quantitative PDCoV-specific PCR","porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","distinguishing diarrhoea","watery diarrhoea","PEDV","complete genomes of PDCoVs","addition","colostrum-deprived piglets","swine farms","enteric pathogens","Porcine deltacoronavirus","causative enteric pathogen of diarrhoeic outbreaks","diagnostic methodology","high level","viremia","faeces","hysterectomy","microscopic observation","experimental infection","useful information","jejunums","colons","viruses","Phylogenetic analysis","China","Hong Kong","pathogenicity","clinical symptoms","Thailand","Vietnam","Laos","findings","survey","countries","Korea"],"language":"en"},

Three HEK-purified antigens [B646L (p72), E183L (p54), and O61R (p12)], and three MVA-vectored antigens [B646L, EP153R, and EP402R (CD2v)] were evaluated using a prime-boost immunization regimen swine safety and immunogenicity study. Antibody responses were detected in pigs following prime-boost immunization four weeks apart with the HEK-293-purified p72, p54, and p12 antigens. Notably, sera from the vaccinees were positive by immunofluorescence on ASFV (Georgia 2007/1)-infected primary macrophages. Although MVA-vectored p72, CD2v, and EP153R failed to induce antibody responses, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3\u002B) spot forming cell responses against all three antigens were detected one week post-boost. The highest IFN-\u03B3\u002B spot forming cell responses were detected against p72 in pigs primed with MVA-p72 and boosted with the recombinant p72. Antigen-specific (p12, p72, CD2v, and EP153R) T-cell proliferative responses were also detected post-boost.

In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication and demonstrated anti-HCV effects of an autophagic proteolysis inhibitor, chloroquine. METHODS: Induction of autophagy was evaluated following the transfection of HCV replicon to Huh-7 cells. Next, we investigated the replication of HCV subgenomic replicon in response to treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors or pharmacological autophagy inhibitor. The effect on HCV replication was analyzed after transfection with siRNA of ATG5, ATG7 and light-chain (LC)-3 to replicon cells. The antiviral effect of chloroquine and/or interferon-\u03B1 (IFN\u03B1) was evaluated. RESULTS: The transfection of HCV replicon increased the number of autophagosomes to about twofold over untransfected cells. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagic proteolysis significantly suppressed expression level of HCV replicon. Silencing of autophagy-related genes by siRNA transfection significantly blunted the replication of HCV replicon. Treatment of replicon cells with chloroquine suppressed the replication of the HCV replicon in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, combination treatment of chloroquine to IFN\u03B1 enhanced the antiviral effect of IFN\u03B1 and prevented re-propagation of HCV replicon. Protein kinase R was activated in cells treated with IFN\u03B1 but not with chloroquine. Incubation with chloroquine decreased degradation of long-lived protein leucine. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the replication of HCV replicon utilizes machinery involving cellular autophagic proteolysis. The therapy targeted to autophagic proteolysis by using chloroquine may provide a new therapeutic option against chronic hepatitis C.","publish_time":"2009-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizui, Tomokazu; Yamashina, Shunhei; Tanida, Isei; Takei, Yoshiyuki; Ueno, Takashi; Sakamoto, Naoya; Ikejima, Kenichi; Kitamura, Tsuneo; Enomoto, Nobuyuki; Sakai, Tatsuo; Kominami, Eiki; Watanabe, Sumio","journal":"J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6098130a6b009a803ce4abeb2bb4d2636ee6c573.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088329.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-009-0132-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of HCV replicon","HCV replication","transfection of HCV replicon","replication of HCV subgenomic replicon","Treatment of replicon cells","re-propagation of HCV replicon","suppressed expression level of HCV replicon","RNA replication","anti-HCV effects","antiviral effect of chloroquine","combination treatment of chloroquine","role of autophagy","autophagic proteolysis inhibitor","cellular autophagic proteolysis","siRNA transfection","pharmacological autophagy inhibitor","Silencing of autophagy","antiviral effect of IFN\u03B1","Induction of autophagy","untransfected cells","Pharmacological inhibition of autophagic proteolysis","replication of various RNA viruses","study","RESULTS","siRNA of ATG5","chronic hepatitis","pivotal role","hepatitis C virus","Protein kinase R","degradation of long-lived protein leucine","response","lysosomal protease inhibitors","ATG7","machinery","new therapeutic option","LC","related genes","light-chain","number of autophagosomes","dose-dependent manner","interferon-\u03B1","Incubation","CONCLUSION","METHODS","therapy","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tests, along with effective vaccines and vector-control strategies, are highly required to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality. Evaluation studies revealed that many commercially available NS1 antigen (Ag) tests have limited sensitivity to DENV-4 serotype compared to the other three serotypes. These studies indicated the need for development of new NS1 Ag detection test with improved sensitivity to DENV-4. An NS1 capture enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) specific to DENV-4 may improve the detection of DENV-4 cases worldwide. In addition, a serotype-specific NS1 Ag test identifies both DENV and the infecting serotype. METHODS: In this study, we used a small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO*) cloning vector to express a SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 fusion protein to develop NS1 DENV-4 specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These newly developed MAbs were then optimized for use in an anti-NS1 DENV-4 capture ELISA. The serotype specificity and sensitivity of this ELISA was evaluated using (i) supernatants from DENV (1\u20134)-infected Vero cell cultures, (ii) rNS1s from all the four DENV (1\u20134) and, (iii) rNS1s of related flaviviruses (yellow fever virus; YFV and West Nile virus; WNV). RESULTS: From the evaluation studies of the newly developed MAbs, we identified three DENV-4 specific anti-NS1 MAbs: 3H7A9, 8A6F2 and 6D4B10. Two of these MAbs were optimal for use in a DENV-4 serotype-specific NS1 capture ELISA: MAb 8A6F2 as the capture antibody and 6D4B10 as a detection antibody. CONCLUSION: This ELISA was sensitive and specific to DENV-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three DENV (1\u20133) serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses. Taken together these data indicated that our MAbs are useful reagents for the development of DENV-4 immunodiagnostic tests.

The characteristics of the biology and intracellular viral RNA synthesis and the intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV are discussed in the two previous papers, respectively. This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV. These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5\u00B0 as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33\u00B0. N-Methyl-N\u2032-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90\u201395%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5\u00B0; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation. RNA-minus ( 17 34 ), RNA-intermediate ( 14 34 ), and RNA-plus ( 3 34 ) groups were defined. One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence. This altered neuropathogenesis cannot be explained by \u201Cleakiness\u201D or reversion. In addition, non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV have been selected for altered neuropathogenesis and are described.","publish_time":"1979-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robb, James A.; Bond, Clifford W.; Leibowitz, Julian L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64e28239246860c5c9f39e62a3b78ce8eebb6f02.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682279904690; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682279904690","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neuropathogenesis of JHMV","Abstract JHMV","temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV","lethal JHMV infection","intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV","typical JHMV encephalitis","intracellular viral RNA synthesis","specific intracellular RNA","immunofluorescence of infected brain","non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV","RNA-minus","altered neuropathogenesis","RNA-intermediate","induction of syncytia","histopathology of brain","indirect immunofluorescence","syncytia formation","characterization","isolation of virus","specific antigens","N-Methyl","low multiplicity infection","sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","light","demyelination","virion thermostability","spinal cord","chronic meningitis","transmission electron microscopy","spite","mice","neurotropic member","biology","hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae","N3","addition","fact","inability","progeny","neurons","mutagens","characteristics","nitrosoguanidine","complementation","concentration","infectivity","BALB","leakiness","fluorouridine","previous papers","reversion","cells","groups"],"language":"en"},

In only a few cases have the human receptors of pathogenic adhesins been described. A novel strategy\u2014based on the construction of a lectin-glycan interaction (LGI) network\u2014to identify the potential human binding receptors for pathogenic adhesins with lectin activity was developed. The new approach is based on linking glycan array screening results of these adhesins to a human glycoprotein database via the construction of an LGI network. This strategy was used to detect human receptors for virulent Escherichia coli (FimH adhesin), and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans (Als1p and Als3p adhesins) and C. glabrata (Epa1, Epa6, and Epa7 adhesins), which cause candidiasis. This LGI network strategy allows the profiling of potential adhesin binding receptors in the host with prioritization, based on experimental binding data, of the most relevant interactions. New potential targets for the selected adhesins were predicted and experimentally confirmed. This methodology was also used to predict lectin interactions with envelope glycoproteins of human-pathogenic viruses. It was shown that this strategy was successful in revealing that the FimH adhesin has anti-HIV activity.","publish_time":"2016-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ielasi, Francesco S.; Alioscha-Perez, Mitchel; Donohue, Dagmara; Claes, Sandra; Sahli, Hichem; Schols, Dominique; Willaert, Ronnie G.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f17288f985aa9c44a23132028973162a800726f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4958244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27406561/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00584-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human receptors of pathogenic adhesins","potential human binding receptors","Als3p adhesins","Epa7 adhesins","selected adhesins","human cell receptors","profiling of potential adhesin binding receptors","LGI network strategy","binding proteins","binding of carbohydrate","lectin activity","lectin interactions","envelope glycoproteins of human","human glycoprotein database","FimH adhesin","novel strategy","lectin-glycan interaction","experimental binding data","construction","pathogenic viruses","New potential targets","microbial pathogens","new approach","relevant interactions","host tissue cells","anti-HIV activity","fungal pathogens Candida albicans","glycan array screening results","adherence","Als1p","virulent Escherichia coli","prioritization","Epa1","infection of humans","Epa6","glabrata","glycans","cases","step","candidiasis","methodology"],"language":"en"},

We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in R\u00E9union Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI.","publish_time":"2016-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brottet, Elise; Jaffar-Bandjee, Marie-Christine; Li-Pat-Yuen, Ghislaine; Filleul, Laurent","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5ff89ebfdd0375d034c112c6c1c7e163fa69a0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5031398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654509/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza surveillance","etiology of Influenza","respiratory viruses","influenza B virus","parainfluenza viruses","surveillance of ILI","nasal swabs","positive swabs","ILI patients","R\u00E9union Island","co-infections","coronavirus","biological surveillance","use of multiplex RT-PCR","circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses","sentinel GPs","retrospective study","substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens","sentinel general practitioner\u2019s network","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","RSV","important seasonal differences","need","summer","research","year","efficacy","illness","tropical area","conclusion","winter","bacteria","rhinovirus","samples","total"],"language":"en"},

We review measures taken to decrease risk of transmission and improve screening for infection in older adults.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fahed, Mario; Barron, Gregory C.; Steffens, David C.","journal":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbdd2333dea5d4f7341d6ee163f3ee8bdb556f1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198992.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748120303286?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409192/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1064748120303286","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["screening","older adults","questions","infection","risk of dissemination","risk of transmission","patient B","potential COVID","masking measures","year-old woman","year-old man","delivery of care","public health","unit","capacity","room isolation","inability","behaviors","context of wandering","threshold","concerns","challenges","inpatient psychiatry","pandemic","coronavirus disease","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, the inability to cryopreserve embryos significantly reduces its broader application, and as such limits the capacity to utilize elite genetic resources internationally. In addition, cryopreservation of the semen of camelids is also difficult, suggesting an extreme sensitivity of the germplasm to cooling and freezing. As a result, genetic resources of camelids must continue to be maintained as living collections of animals. Due to concerns over disease outbreaks such as that of the highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East and Asia, there is an urgent need to establish an effective gene banking system for camelid species, especially the camel. The current review compares and summarizes recent progress in the field of camelid embryo cryopreservation, identifying four possible reasons for the slow development of an effective protocol and describing eight future directions to improve the current protocols. At the same time, the results of a recent dromedary camel embryo transfer study which produced a high morphologic integrity and survival rate of Open Pulled Straw-vitrified embryos are also discussed.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrid, M.; Vajta, G.; Skidmore, J.

Elucidating principles of molecular recognition governing important interfaces such as coiled coils is a challenging goal for structural and systems biology. We report here that two valine-containing mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper that fold individually as four-stranded coiled coils associate preferentially in mixtures to form an antiparallel, heterotetrameric structure. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that the coinciding hydrophobic interfaces of the hetero- and homotetramers differ in detail, explaining their partnering and structural specificity. Equilibrium disulfide exchange and thermal denaturation experiments show that the 50-fold preference for heterospecificity results from a combination of preferential packing and hydrophobicity. The extent of preference is sensitive to the side chains comprising the interface. Thus, heterotypic versus homotypic interaction specificity in coiled coils reflects a delicate balance in complementarity of shape and chemistry of the participating side chains.","publish_time":"2008-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Li, Qunnu; Kallenbach, Neville R.; Lu, Min","journal":"Chemistry \u0026 Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c615f013fb4574e31dc9034028e178cb88c2e49b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111190.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552108002743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18804028/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074552108002743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.07.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coiled coils","structural specificity","fold preference","chains","important interfaces","Summary Protein-protein interactions","extent of preference","coinciding hydrophobic interfaces","homotypic interaction specificity","macromolecular complexes essential","functional networks","assembly","delicate balance","challenging goal","heterospecificity results","thermal denaturation experiments","Equilibrium disulfide exchange","combination of preferential packing","complementarity of shape","chemistry","Elucidating principles of molecular recognition","cellular behavior","mutants","systems biology","mixtures","crystallographic analysis","GCN4 leucine zipper","hydrophobicity","heterotetrameric structure","valine","homotetramers","partnering"],"language":"en"},

It is often these host responses that appear as the most prominent signs and symptoms of virus infection.","publish_time":"2009-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Summers, W.C.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149757.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123739445003230; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739445003230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus release phase","symptoms of virus infection","virus infections","intracellular phase","entry phase","inapparent infection","sort of host responses","Viruses","protist cells","intracellular parasites","latency formation","plant","result","multiplication","integration","presence","prominent signs","animal","effects","lethality","inert entities","features"],"language":"en"},

ISG15 is synthesized as a precursor in certain mammals and, therefore, needs to be processed to expose the C-terminal glycine residue before conjugation to target proteins. A set of three-step cascade enzymes, an E1 enzyme (UBE1L), an E2 enzyme (UbcH8), and one of several E3 ligases (e.g., EFP and HERC5), catalyzes ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) of a specific protein. These enzymes are unique among the cascade enzymes for ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins in that all of them are induced by type I IFNs or other stimuli, such as exposure to viruses and lipopolysaccharide. Mass spectrometric analysis has led to the identification of several hundreds of candidate proteins that can be conjugated by ISG15. Some of them are type I IFN-induced proteins, such as PKR and RIG-I, and some are the key regulators that are involved in IFN signaling, such as JAK1 and STAT1, implicating the role of ISG15 and its conjugates in type I IFN-mediated innate immune responses. However, relatively little is known about the functional significance of ISG15 induction due to the lack of information on the consequences of its conjugation to target proteins. Here, we describe the recent progress made in exploring the biological function of ISG15 and its reversible modification of target proteins and thus in their implication in immune diseases.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeon, Young Joo; Yoo, Hee Min; Chung, Chin Ha","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc8ccab719f88424dc903e536ae75dbf936ce026.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127291.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443910000487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153823/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2010.02.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443910000487","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISG15 conjugation","role of ISG15","Abstract ISG15","IFN-induced proteins","biological function of ISG15","type","reversible modification of target proteins","hundreds of candidate proteins","functional significance of ISG15 induction","identified ubiquitin","step cascade enzymes","E1 enzyme","E2 enzyme","immune diseases","specific protein","innate immune responses","identification","UBE1L","product of interferon","C-terminal glycine residue","lack of information","EFP","consequences","HERC5","implication","ISGylation","conjugates","stimulated gene","stimuli","exposure","viruses","JAK1","precursor","STAT1","set","PKR","Mass spectrometric analysis","E3 ligases","recent progress","certain mammals","lipopolysaccharide","UbcH8","key regulators","RIG","IFNs","domains"],"language":"en"},

In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease. We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are expressed in the intestine. We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage. METHODS: We examined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 by quantitative polymerase chain reacion in animal models of IBD. Publicly available data from organoids and mucosal biopsies from patients with IBD were examined for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We conducted RNA sequencing for CD11b-enriched cells and peripheral and lamina propria T-cells from well-annotated patient samples. RESULTS: The molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundantly expressed in the ileum and colon and had high expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In animal models, inflammation led to downregulation of epithelial Ace2. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not increased in samples from patients with compared with those of control patients. In CD11b-enriched cells but not T-cells, the level of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mucosa was comparable to other functional mucosal genes and was not affected by inflammation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and steroids were linked to significantly lower expression of ACE2 in CD11b-enriched cells. CONCLUSIONS: The viral entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and colon. Patients with IBD do not have higher expression during inflammation; medical therapy is associated with lower levels of ACE2. These data provide reassurance for patients with IBD.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burgue\u00F1o, Juan F; Reich, Adrian; Hazime, Hajar; Quintero, Maria A; Irina, Fernandez; Fritsch, Julia; Santander, Ana M; Brito, Nivis; Damas, Oriana M; Deshpande, Amar; Kerman, David H; Zhang, Lanyu; Gao, Zhen; Ban, Yuguang; Wang, Lily; Pignac-Kobinger, Judith; Abreu, Maria T","journal":"Inflamm Bowel Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be6d025ca85c5eebe4c6b2ab2da4640ee3afe7c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188157.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izaa085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TMPRSS2","lower expression of ACE2","high expression","higher expression","level of expression","lower levels of ACE2","downregulation of epithelial Ace2","viral entry molecules ACE2","CD11b-enriched cells","control patients","intestinal inflammation","intestinal epithelial cells","animal models of IBD","lamina propria T-cells","viral entry molecules angiotensin","coronavirus disease","ileum","colon","inflammatory bowel disease","mucosal biopsies","available data","functional mucosal genes","well-annotated patient samples","quantitative polymerase chain reacion","vedolizumab","medical therapy","enzyme","Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs","ustekinumab","organoids","transmembrane serine protease","steroids","BACKGROUND","RNA sequencing","CONCLUSIONS","infection","reassurance","RESULTS","immune-modulating medications","face","pandemic","medication usage","intestine","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Several mammalian \u03B1- and \u03B2-defensins, genetically related to \u03B8-defensins, have proinflammatory and immune-activating properties that bridge innate and acquired immunity. In the current study we analyzed the immunoregulatory properties of rhesus \u03B8-defensins 1\u20135 (RTDs 1\u20135). RTD-1, the most abundant \u03B8-defensin in macaques, reduced the levels of TNF, IL-1\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and IL-8 secreted by blood leukocytes stimulated by several TLR agonists. RTDs 1\u20135 suppressed levels of soluble TNF released by bacteria- or LPS-stimulated blood leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes. Despite their highly conserved conformation and amino acid sequences, the anti-TNF activities of RTDs 1\u20135 varied by as much as 10-fold. Systemically administered RTD-1 was non-toxic for BALB/c mice, and escalating intravenous doses were well tolerated and non-immunogenic in adult chimpanzees. The peptide was highly stable in serum and plasma. Single dose administration of RTD-1 at 5 mg/kg significantly improved survival of BALB/c mice with E. coli peritonitis and cecal ligation-and-puncture induced polymicrobial sepsis. Peptide treatment reduced serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in bacteremic animals.

In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this with data on kinetics of shedding and immune response from published literature on other human coronaviruses (hCoVs). We identify and discuss important data gaps, and biases that limit the laboratory preparedness to this novel disease. Public health management will benefit from standardised reporting of methods used, details of test outcomes by sample type, sampling date, in relation to symptoms and risk factors, along with the currently reported demographic, clinical and epidemiological findings.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Sousa, Rita; Reusken, Chantal; Koopmans, Marion","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6eddf8d6260053b650b2734970140c9efe710ab9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108266.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653213004782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286807/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653213004782; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.10.030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["shedding kinetics","kinetics of shedding","Laboratory response capacity","viral shedding","relation","antibody response","immune response","core public health laboratory capacity","modes of transmission","laboratory preparedness","severe human disease","available data","spectrum of disease","novel disease","important data gaps","fundamental understanding of kinetics","details of test outcomes","Public health management","interpretation of test outcomes","immunological methods","MERS-CoV case reports","epidemiological studies","human coronaviruses","epidemiological findings","risk factors","sources of virus","outbreak situations","standardised reporting of methods","identification of risk groups","emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","sampling date","sample type","published literature","patient diagnosis","emerging organisms","assay validation","contact tracing","development of virological","early stages","symptoms","biases","reported demographic","optimal use","infectivity","animal reservoirs","Abstract","ability","hCoVs","questions"],"language":"en"},

Addition of ligand oxides (LO) causes a red shift in the \u03BB max values of oxo(salen) complexes and an increase in absorbance with the concentration of LO along with a clear isobestic point. The reaction shows first-order dependence on oxo(salen)-chromium(V)\u002B ion and fractional-order dependence on PSAA and ligand oxide. Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics without kinetic saturation was observed for the reaction. The order of reactivity among the ligand oxides is picoline N-oxide\u003Epyridine N-oxide\u003Etriphenylphosphine oxide. The low catalytic activity of TPPO was rationalized. Both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents in the phenyl ring of PSAA facilitate the reaction rate. The Hammett plots are non-linear upward type with negative \u03C1 value for electron-donating substituents, (\u03C1 \u2212 =\u22120.740 to \u22124.10) and positive \u03C1 value for electron-withdrawing substituents (\u03C1 \u002B =\u002B0.057 to \u002B0.886). Non-linear Hammett plot is explained by two possible mechanistic scenarios, electrophilic and nucleophilic attack of oxo(salen)chromium(V)\u002B-LO adduct on PSAA as the substituent in PSAA is changed from electron-donating to electron-withdrawing. The linearity in the log k vs. E ox plot confirms single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism for PSAAs with electron-donating substituents.","publish_time":"2016-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramaniam, P.; Sugirtha Devi, S.; Anbarasan, S.","journal":"Polyhedron","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21ebe1d0e7c7bf6fa08958491dbead1f67e4a2a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116920.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287835/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poly.2016.05.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277538716301541; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277538716301541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["LO","Hammett"],"organizations":["TPPO","PSAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["salen","substituents","single-electron transfer","presence of ligand oxides","Addition of ligand oxides","triphenylphosphine oxide","picoline N-oxide","pyridine N-oxide","negative \u03C1 value","phenyl ring of PSAA","positive \u03C1 value","nucleophilic attack of oxo","fractional-order dependence","Non-linear Hammett plot","order of reactivity","chromium","reaction rate","\u03BB max values of oxo","Hammett plots","non-linear upward type","E ox plot","mechanism of oxidative decarboxylation of phenylsulfinylacetic acids","SET","possible mechanistic scenarios","kinetic saturation","complexes","PSAAs","red shift","Michaelis","Menten kinetics","log","increase","low catalytic activity of TPPO","concentration","absorbance","clear isobestic point","linearity","acetonitrile medium"],"language":"en"},

Infectious myositis is most commonly caused by bacteria; however, a variety of viral, parasitic, and fungal agents may also cause myositis. The pathogenesis of nonbacterial infectious myositis is via direct or hematogenous infection of the musculature or immune mechanisms. Symptoms typically include muscular pain, tenderness, swelling, and/or weakness. The diagnosis of the specific microbe is often suggested by the presence of concordant clinical signs and symptoms, a detailed medical and travel history, and laboratory data. For example, immunocompromised hosts have a heightened risk of fungal myositis, whereas the presence of a travel history to an endemic location and/or eosinophilia may suggest a parasitic cause. Definitive diagnosis requires detecting the organism by specific laboratory testing including serologies, histopathology, and/or cultures. Treatment entails antimicrobial agents against the pathogen, with consideration for surgical drainage for focal purulent collections within the musculature.","publish_time":"2010-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crum-Cianflone, Nancy F.","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b665ee3ccfd19a2d1609e78c9b7b51a60be0865.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3043460.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-010-0118-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21308520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of nonbacterial infectious myositis","heightened risk of fungal myositis","Symptoms","travel history","fungal agents","musculature","parasitic cause","specific laboratory testing","hematogenous infection","laboratory data","antimicrobial agents","specific microbe","Definitive diagnosis","presence of concordant clinical signs","surgical drainage","consideration","organism","focal purulent collections","histopathology","serologies","immunocompromised hosts","eosinophilia","endemic location","variety of viral","immune mechanisms","example","muscular pain","tenderness","Treatment","skeletal muscle","cultures","weakness"],"language":"en"}]}

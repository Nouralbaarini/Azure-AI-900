Our former studies indicated roles of calpain in VMC pathogenesis. This study aimed at verifying the potential of calpain in Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis treatment. Methods A transgenic mouse overexpressing the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, was introduced in the study. VMC mouse model was established via intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 in transgenic and wild mouse respectively. Myocardial injury was assayed histologically (HE staining and pathology grading) and serologically (myocardial damage markers of CK-MB and cTnI). CVB3 replication was observed in vivo and in vitro via the capsid protein VP1 detection or virus titration. Inflammation/fibrotic factors of MPO, perforin, IFN\u03B3, IL17, Smad3 and MMP2 were evaluated using western blot or immunohistology stain. Role of calpain in regulating fibroblast migration was studied in scratch assays. Results Calpastatin overexpression ameliorated myocardial injury induced by CVB3 infection significantly in transgenic mouse indicated by reduced peripheral CK-MB and cTnI levels and improved histology injury. Comparing with CVB3-infected wild type mouse, the transgenic mouse heart tissue carried lower virus load. The inflammation factors of MPO, perforin, IFN\u03B3 and IL17 were down-regulated accompanied with fibrotic agents of Smad3 and MMP2 inhibition. And calpain participated in the migration of fibroblasts in vitro, which further proves its role in regulating fibrosis. Conclusion Calpain plays dual roles of facilitating CVB3 replication and inflammation promotion. Calpain inhibition in CVB3-induced myocarditis showed significant treatment effect. Calpain might be a novel target for VMC treatment in clinical practices.","publish_time":"2016-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Minghui; Su, Yangang; Yu, Yong; Yu, Ying; Wang, Xinggang; Zou, Yunzeng; Ge, Junbo; Chen, Ruizhen","journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/311d140154026feab3f47bedda187565a9b1641f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114300.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527316314747; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527316314747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27472894/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.07.121","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of calpain","Calpain inhibition","Role of calpain","potential of calpain","Conclusion Calpain","CVB3-induced myocarditis","wild mouse","CVB3 infection","VMC treatment","VMC mouse model","CVB3-infected wild type mouse","induced myocarditis treatment","endogenous calpain inhibitor","transgenic mouse heart tissue","intraperitoneal injection of CVB3","Myocardial injury","dual roles of facilitating CVB3 replication","VMC pathogenesis","inflammation factors of MPO","perforin","IFN\u03B3","fibrotic factors of MPO","significant treatment effect","MMP2 inhibition","IL17","inflammation promotion","study","myocardial damage markers of CK","peripheral CK-MB","improved histology injury","fibrotic agents of Smad3","cTnI levels","virus titration","Abstract Background Viral myocarditis","fibroblast migration","migration of fibroblasts","effective methods","lower virus load","Results Calpastatin overexpression","novel target","Coxsackievirus B3","capsid protein VP1 detection","western blot","clinical practices","immunohistology stain","scratch assays","studies","pathology grading","fibrosis"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe both cross sectional and longitudinal studies in two rescue kennels and two boarding kennels, together with molecular diagnostics, to provide a new insight into the epidemiology of CECoV. Prevalence of CECoV in the cross sectional studies tended to be higher in the rescue kennels (13.8% and 33.3%) than the boarding kennels (5.3% and 13.5%). In each kennel, type I CECoV was more prevalent than type 2 CECoV. The mean quantity of type I detected was equivalent to 6.3 \u00D7 10(8) gc/gm (range = 5 \u00D7 10(6), 8.5 \u00D7 10(11)), compared to 1.3 \u00D7 10(8) gc/gm (range = 3 \u00D7 10(6), 2.4 \u00D7 10(10)) for type II. In one rescue shelter where dogs were followed longitudinally, infection was significantly associated with accommodation block as well as the length of stay (increased risk of CECoV per week in residence of \u00D71.9). Of those animals sampled on two or more occasions, none tested positive on arrival, and 54.5% later shed CECoV, suggesting that infection may have been acquired within the kennel. Shedding patterns and sequence analysis suggested both types I and II CECoV were maintained in this population by a combination of introductions into the shelter and within-shelter transmission. The findings suggest that some kennel environments may be important in maintaining CECoV infection in the population. We also propose that the diversity of viruses like CECoV in these populations may provide a novel surrogate marker for the success of biosecurity.","publish_time":"2012-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stavisky, Jenny; Pinchbeck, Gina; Gaskell, Rosalind M.; Dawson, Susan; German, Alexander J.; Radford, Alan D.","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/361d5def0b09fdea7a73f8bc7c1b159ded4bc54d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106024.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134812001426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22543007/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.04.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134812001426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CECoV infection","epidemiology of CECoV","Prevalence of CECoV","increased risk of CECoV","rescue kennels","boarding kennels","rescue shelter","cross sectional studies","longitudinal studies","Previous studies","shelter transmission","kennel environments","gc","gm","range","mean quantity of type","kennelled dogs","populations","novel surrogate marker","length of stay","new insight","molecular diagnostics","sequence analysis","types","week","Shedding patterns","success of biosecurity","occasions","accommodation block","combination of introductions","residence","household pets","diversity of viruses","arrival","findings","animals"],"language":"en"},

The human complement receptor type 1 (CR1) is an innate immune recognition glycoprotein that regulates the activation of the complement pathway and removes opsonized immune complexes. CR1 genetic variants in exon 29 have been associated with expression levels, C1q or C3b binding and increased susceptibility to several infectious diseases. Five distinct CR1 nucleotide substitutions determine the Knops blood group phenotypes, namely Kn(a/b), McC(a/b), Sl1/Sl2, Sl4/Sl5 and KCAM\u002B/-. METHODS: CR1 variants were genotyped by direct sequencing in a cohort of 441 healthy individuals from Brazil, Vietnam, India, Republic of Congo and Ghana. RESULTS: The distribution of the CR1 alleles, genotypes and haplotypes differed significantly among geographical settings (p\u22640.001). CR1 variants rs17047660A/G (McC(a/b)) and rs17047661A/G (Sl1/Sl2) were exclusively observed to be polymorphic in African populations compared to the groups from Asia and South-America, strongly suggesting that these two SNPs may be subjected to selection. This is further substantiated by a high linkage disequilibrium between the two variants in the Congolese and Ghanaian populations. A total of nine CR1 haplotypes were observed. The CR1*AGAATA haplotype was found more frequently among the Brazilian and Vietnamese study groups; the CR1*AGAATG haplotype was frequent in the Indian and Vietnamese populations, while the CR1*AGAGTG haplotype was frequent among Congolese and Ghanaian individuals. CONCLUSION: The African populations included in this study might have a selective advantage conferred to immune genes involved in pathogen recognition and signaling, possibly contributing to disease susceptibility or resistance.","publish_time":"2017-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucas Sandri, Thaisa; Adukpo, Selorme; Giang, Dao Phuong; Nguetse, Christian N.; Antunes Andrade, Fabiana; van Tong, Hoang; Toan, Nguyen Linh; Song, Le Huu; Elumalai, Preetham; Thangaraj, Kumarasamy; Valluri, Vijaya Lakshmi; Ntoumi, Francine; Meyer, Christian G.; Jose de Messias Reason, Iara; Kremsner, Peter G.; Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c32d0c0e6f09f6da1b8d9075733574b26bfec04a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5435133.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Ghana","Brazil","India","Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["CR1 haplotypes","CR1 alleles","CR1 variants rs17047660A","CR1 genetic variants","distinct CR1 nucleotide substitutions","Vietnamese populations","African populations","Ghanaian populations","immune genes","Vietnamese study groups","host immune responses","opsonized immune complexes","innate immune recognition glycoprotein","Sl2","AGAATG haplotype","Sl1","Congolese","AGAGTG haplotype","McC","Ghanaian individuals","AGAATA haplotype","increased susceptibility","complement pathway","selective pressure","healthy individuals","selective advantage","pathogen recognition","disease susceptibility","human complement receptor type","C3b binding","Knops blood group phenotypes","India","Brazil","C1q","substantial changes","cohort","genotypes","activation","Republic of Congo","expression levels","direct sequencing","Sl4","Sl5","distribution","Asia","exon","rs17047661A","geographical settings","infectious diseases","BACKGROUND","Pathogens","KCAM","South-America","high linkage disequilibrium","resistance","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","total","METHODS","SNPs","selection"],"language":"en"},

This heuristic provides a novel approach to optimal design for Bayesian model discrimination.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cope, Robert C.; Ross, Joshua V.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc811b2c021f9d78a6d2a06156b9fc42c34e4c4b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c72595eda8a721e9bff19fcc18ecbb8510054f37.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/571547","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptom onset","outbreak response","household-stratified symptom-onset data","optimal design","efficient heuristic","optimal surveillance scheme","novel approach","Bayesian model discrimination","relative timing of infectiousness","epidemiological characteristics","emerging disease","high accuracy","pathogen","relationship","important tool","key determinant of ability","observations","specific days","method"],"language":"en"},

Spinel thin films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm were obtained from the [(Ni x Mn1- x )0.84Cu0.16]3O4 films annealed at the low temperature of 380 \u00B0C for 5 h, which enables their direct integration onto substrates having complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out circuitry. To obtain negative-temperature-coefficient films with reasonable performance through low enough temperature anneal process, Ni content has been systematically varied, and the film microstructure has been found to depend on the relative amount of Ni and Mn. A single phase of cubic spinel structure has been confirmed in the prepared films. The resistivity (\u03C1) of the annealed films decreases with increasing Mn4\u002B/Mn3\u002B value due to the hopping mechanism between Mn3\u002B and Mn4\u002B cations in octahedral sites of spinel structure. Although the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the annealed films has been decreased slightly with the increase of Ni content, good enough properties of the film (\u03C1 = 61.3 \u03A9\u2022cm, TCR = \u22122.950%/K in x = 0.30 film) has been obtained even with the annealing at rather low temperature of 380 \u00B0C, thus enabling the direct integration onto substrates having read-out circuitry.

To understand viral disease, detection and identification of these viruses are essential. Although PCR is widely used for rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, very few online database resources have compiled PCR primers for RNA viruses. To effectively detect viruses, the MRPrimerV database (http://MRPrimerV.com) contains 152 380 247 PCR primer pairs for detection of 1818 viruses, covering 7144 coding sequences (CDSs), representing 100% of the RNA viruses in the most up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database. Due to rigorous similarity testing against all human and viral sequences, every primer in MRPrimerV is highly target-specific. Because MRPrimerV ranks CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer, users need only use the first primer pair for a single-phase PCR or the first two primer pairs for two-phase PCR. Moreover, MRPrimerV provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, covering 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses. We believe that the public availability of MRPrimerV will facilitate viral metagenomics studies aimed at evaluating the variability of viruses, as well as other scientific tasks.","publish_time":"2017-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyerin; Kang, NaNa; An, KyuHyeon; Kim, Doyun; Koo, JaeHyung; Kim, Min-Soo","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5210568.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899620/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","PCR","MRPrimerV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RefSeq RNA viruses","variability of viruses","PCR primer pairs","MRPrimerV database","best primer","viral sequences","PCR primers","single-phase PCR","two-phase PCR","viral infections","viral disease","public availability of MRPrimerV","viral metagenomics studies","detection","CDSs","up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database","online database resources","coding sequences","rapid virus identification","specificity","low cost","penalty scores","variants","high sensitivity","rigorous similarity testing","Ebola","users","infectious diseases","list of genome neighbors","target-specific","Zika","scientific tasks"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, LiLACs and African Index Medicus to June 2009-March 2016. RESULTS: 226 studies from 50 countries met our inclusion criteria. Mortality associated with H1N1-related critical illness was 31% (95% CI 28\u201334). Reported mortality was highest in South Asia (61% [95% CI 50\u201371]) and Sub-Saharan Africa (53% [95% CI 29\u201375]), in comparison to Western Europe (25% [95% CI 22\u201330]), North America (25% [95% CI 22\u201327]) and Australia (15% [95% CI 13\u201318]) (P\u003C0.0001). High income economies had significantly lower reported mortality compared to upper middle income economies and lower middle income economies respectively (P\u003C0.0001). Mortality for the first wave was non-significantly higher than wave two (P = 0.66). There was substantial variability in reported mortality among the specific subgroups of patients: unselected critically ill adults (27% [95% CI 24\u201330]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (37% [95% CI 32\u201344]), acute kidney injury (44% [95% CI 26\u201364]), and critically ill pregnant patients (10% [95% CI 5\u201319]).

Outcomes from a relatively small number of patients from specific regions may lead to biased estimates of outcomes on a global scale.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duggal, Abhijit; Pinto, Ruxandra; Rubenfeld, Gordon; Fowler, Robert A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffe663e4ef5018da41f057533520b9d85ec86e18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4865181.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27170999/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Asia","Western Europe","North America","Australia"],"keyphrases":["lower reported mortality","specific subgroups of patients","lower middle income economies","H1N1-related critical illness","High income economies","small number of patients","upper middle income economies","ill pregnant patients","specific regions","wave","Influenza","study-specific factors","ill adults","meta-regression of studies","biased estimates of outcomes","selected patient characteristics","acute kidney injury","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Embase","LiLACs","Medline","Systematic review","healthcare system","African Index Medicus","economic status","METHODS","countries","outbreaks","pandemics","outbreak location","DATA SOURCES","global scale","substantial variability","South Asia","CONCLUSION","inclusion criteria","Sub-Saharan Africa","comparison","Western Europe","RESULTS","North America","PURPOSE","Australia"],"language":"en"},

However, some serious criticisms have been raised in the field of strategic management against the employment of such a formal and systematic approach to ES. These opposing views have rarely been discussed in the hospitality management literature. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to bring these views to the fore in the process of reviewing previous research into ES, and to discuss the major challenges involved for hospitality organizations in employing such a formal approach to ES. The discussion throughout this paper reveals that ES is essential for every organization; however, it is even more complex and difficult to accomplish than portrayed in most previous studies in the hospitality management field. The paper identifies and discusses major challenges and problems in employing a form ES approach in hospitality organizations. It also provides recommendations about how ES activities can best be carried out in complex and dynamic environments.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okumus, Fevzi","journal":"International Journal of Hospitality Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a676eea1e0fd739ca224e7012fbd9db8f36dcae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131092.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2003.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287844/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027843190300080X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843190300080X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ES activities","hospitality organizations","form ES approach","field of hospitality management","hospitality management field","formal systematic ES procedures","freestanding ES unit","hospitality management literature","formal approach","paper","field of strategic management","systematic approach","previous studies","previous research","major challenges","opposing views","opportunities","threats","process","employment","problems","environmental scanning","external environment","fore","dynamic environments","recommendations","discussion","serious criticisms","aim"],"language":"en"},

Focusing on improving health management of replacements will yield tremendous returns through decreased losses of animals with the greatest genetic potential on the dairy, decreased costs of medication, improved growth rates, improved feed efficiency and earlier entry into the milking herd. Health management begins before replacements are born with attention to the nutrition of lactating and dry cows, the vaccination of lactating and dry cows, control of length of the dry period and both control of the disease status of the dams and the cleanliness of the calving environment. Greater attention must be paid to animal and environmental biosecurity to prevent introduction of diseases into the herd and to digestive disorders such as diarrhea, internal parasites and appropriate vaccination programs for the calves. Health management of replacements is often overlooked because producers do not see the immediate returns for their efforts. Common sense management in cattle, historical facts, experience based practice cultural and social aspects, combined with research, would depict that having adequately optimised balanced diets for the replacements, without producing excessive body conditions, could achieve a production of healthy replacements with superior levels of milk production.

Moreover, special focus will be given to zoonotic aspects of the disease, as tularaemia outbreaks in human populations have been frequently associated with disease in animals.","publish_time":"2014-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carvalho, C.L.; Lopes de Carvalho, I.; Z\u00E9-Z\u00E9, L.; N\u00FAncio, M.S.; Duarte, E.L.","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4c04b89b12a81de8377021923f827b7c49b2ba3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124367.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957114000034; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2014.01.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957114000034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Francisella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["tularaemia outbreaks","disease","potential impact","zoonotic aspects","human health","potential use","human populations","latest outbreaks","Francisella tularensis","emerging zoonotic vector","infections","rodents","lagomorphs","wide range of wild species","carnivores","fish","biology","agent","paper","recent years","regard","main features","invertebrate arthropods","immunology","new settings","aim","bioterrorists","Europe","special focus","renewed concern"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, among 985 bats belonging to 6 species sampled in the Belinga caves of Gabon, RNA of an unclassified paramyxovirus (Belinga bat virus, BelPV) was discovered in 14 African sheath-tailed bats (Coleura afra), one of which exhibited several hemorrhagic lesions at necropsy, and viral sequence was obtained in two animals. Phylogenetically, BelPV is related to J virus and Beilong virus (BeiPV), two other unclassified paramyxoviruses isolated from rodents. In the diseased BelPV-infected C. afra individual, high viral load was detected in the heart, and the lesions were consistent with those reported in wild rodents and mice experimentally infected by J virus. BelPV was not detected in other tested bat species sharing the same roosting sites and living in very close proximity with C. afra in the two caves sampled, suggesting that this virus may be host-specific for C. afra.

Due to the notable difference of the Reynolds numbers for the two convection processes, the traditional RANS method can hardly simulate the forced/natural convection flows accurately at the same time. In addition, the large geometric ratio between the main air supply inlet and the whole cabin leads to difficulties in grid generation for the cabin space. An efficient computational model based on the standard k-e model is established to solve these problems. The coefficients in the dissipative equation are modified to compensate the enlarged numerical dissipation caused by coarse grid; meanwhile, the piecewise-defined turbulent viscosity is introduced to combine the forced and natural convection. The modified model is validated by available experimental results in a Boeing 737-200 mock-up. Furthermore, the unsteady characteristic of the aircraft cabin environment is obtained and analyzed. According to the frequency analysis, it turns out that the thermal plume is the main factor of the unsteady fluctuation in cabin.

METHODS: The retrospective case study was conducted at the Pediatric ward and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) dedicated to the children (aged 18 years or younger) with influenza-like illness (ILI) with positive laboratory test results for pandemic H1N1 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Between August 2009 and January 2010, a total of 100 children were hospitalized with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza with Category \u201CC\u201D as described by the Government of India. Twenty five patients were positive for H1N1 and 9 for seasonal influenza A. The most common presentation (H1N1 positive) was with fever (100%), cough (100%), coryza (52%), respiratory distress (88%), vomiting (28%) and diarrhea (16%). One child presented with hypernatremic dehydration and seizures (Serum sodium 174 meq/l). Of the H1N1 positive hospitalized children, 7 (28%) had respiratory failure and required PICU admission, 4 (16%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3 (12%) died. The major radiological findings were bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and consolidation. All patients were treated with oral Oseltamivir suspension or capsule as per appropriate weigh band and supportive care as required. Two deaths were caused by refractory hypoxemia and one by refractory shock.

In many instances these challenges lead to oxidative alterations of peptides and proteins within the lung. Measurement of protein oxidation products permits the degree of oxidative stress to be assessed and indicates that endogenous antioxidant defences are overwhelmed. The range of protein oxidation products observed is diverse and the nature and extent of specific oxidation products may inform us about the nature of the damaging ROS and NOS. Recently, there has been a significant shift away from the measurement of these oxidation products simply to establish the presence of oxidative stress, to a focus on identifying specific proteins sensitive to oxidation and establishing the functional consequences of these modifications. In addition the identification of specific enzyme systems to repair these oxidative modifications has lead to the belief that protein function may be regulated through these oxidation reactions. In this review we focus primarily on the soluble protein components of within the surface liquid layer in the lung and the consequence of their undue oxidation.","publish_time":"2003-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, F.

Hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir therapy are generally restricted to severe cases but also systematically recommended in newborns in France, irrespective of the clinical severity of the infection. This recommendation was launched in 1998 when Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunoglobulins were not available in the country and has remained unchanged since. The aim of this prospective observational study was to describe complications of varicella infection in a population of 745 children hospitalized for varicella before 1 year of age, with a specific focus on newborns. Complications occurred in 65% of cases. They were very rare before the age of 1 month (10%) but their incidence then increased progressively with age and probably the disappearance of maternal antibodies: 42% (1\u20132 months), 66% (3\u20135 months), 70% (6\u20138 months), and 79% (9\u201312 months). Conclusion Chickenpox is usually mild in newborns because most of them are protected by VZV maternal antibodies. Unless the absence of maternal VZV immunity is demonstrated, newborns with mild chickenpox should not require antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2010-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00E9cuyer, Aur\u00E9lie; Levy, Corinne; Gaudelus, Joel; Floret, Daniel; Soubeyrand, Benoit; Caulin, Evelyne; Cohen, Robert; Grimprel, Emmanuel","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c9beabec7ec635a2db7856e37255d600abbb82f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101746.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusion Chickenpox","VZV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["newborns","months of life","VZV maternal antibodies","mild chickenpox","persistence of maternal antibodies","disappearance of maternal antibodies","year of age","complications of varicella infection","absence of maternal VZV immunity","year of life","Conclusion Chickenpox","severe cases","Varicella zoster virus","specific immunoglobulins","specific focus","antiviral therapy","intravenous acyclovir therapy","population","prospective observational study","children","country","aim","clinical severity","Hospitalization","France","course","incidence","recommendation"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS: The existence of the brain RAS remains surprisingly controversial. New sensitive in situ hybridization techniques and novel transgenic animals expressing reporter genes have provided pivotal information of the expression of RAS genes within the brain. We discuss studies using genetically engineered animals combined with targeted viral microinjections to study molecular mechanisms implicated in the regulation of the brain RAS. We also discuss novel drugs targeting the brain RAS that have shown promising results in clinical studies and trials. SUMMARY: Over the last 50 years, several new physiological roles of the brain RAS have been identified. In the coming years, efforts to incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and single-cell RNA sequencing will lead to dramatic advances in our full understanding of how the brain RAS operates at molecular and neurophysiological levels.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakagawa, Pablo; Gomez, Javier; Grobe, Justin L.; Sigmund, Curt D.","journal":"Curr Hypertens Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fcc3896445a8ac9bab74697da1081e8fa1c6279.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101821.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["brain RAS","expression of RAS genes","molecular mechanisms","molecular perspective","novel transgenic animals","engineered animals","reporter genes","New sensitive","novel drugs","coming years","clinical studies","neurophysiological levels","new physiological roles","situ hybridization techniques","chemogenetics","targeted viral microinjections","pivotal information","promising results","cutting-edge technologies","single-cell RNA sequencing","dramatic advances","optogenetics","efforts","trials","existence","understanding","regulation","renin-angiotensin system","main goal","REVIEW","development of state-of-the-art technology","article","fundamental questions","RECENT FINDINGS","PURPOSE","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and clinical impact of severe hematological abnormalities in patients with confirmed influenza virus infection. This was an observational retrospective study including all adult patients with diagnosis of influenza virus infection hospitalized from January to May 2016 in our institution. Influenza virus infection was diagnosed by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples. Poor outcome was defined as a composite endpoint in which at least one of the following criteria had to be fulfilled: (a) respiratory failure, (b) SOFA \u22652, or (c) death. Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Applying the HLH-04 criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome, cytopenias (hemoglobin \u22649 g/dl, platelets \u003C100,000/\u03BCl or neutrophils \u003C1,000/\u03BCl) were present in 51 patients (21%). Patients with hematological abnormalities showed higher SOFA scores, respiratory failure, septic shock and in-hospital mortality than the remaining patients. The composite endpoint was present in 33.3% in the cytopenias group vs. 13.3% in the group without cytopenias (p=0.001). In a multivariate analysis, variables associated with the composite endpoint were: use of steroids prior to present admission (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.015\u20130.96, p=0.046), presence of any hematological abnormality (OR: 3.54; 95% CI:1.66\u20137.51, p= 0.001), and LDH\u003E225 U/l (OR:4.45; CI:1\u201319.71, p=0.049).

Twenty-eight mongrel dogs were randomly divided into four groups: Sham-operated, AF-control, gene therapy with adenovirus-enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad-EGFP) and gene therapy with Ad-ACE2 (Ad-ACE2) (n = 7 per subgroup). AF was induced in all dogs except the Sham-operated group by rapid atrial pacing at 450 beats/min for 2 weeks. Ad-EGFP and Ad-ACE2 group then received epicardial gene painting. Three weeks after gene transfer, all animals except the Sham group underwent rapid atrial pacing for another 3 weeks and then invasive electrophysiological, histological and molecular studies. The Ad-ACE2 group showed an increased ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1\u20137) expression, and decreased Angiotensin II expression in comparison with Ad-EGFP and AF-control group. ACE2 overexpression attenuated rapid atrial pacing-induced increase in activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) levels, and decrease in MAPK phosphatase 1(MKP-1) level, resulting in attenuation of atrial fibrosis collagen protein markers and transforming growth factor-\u03B21. Additionally, ACE2 overexpression also modulated the tachypacing-induced up-regulation of connexin 40, down-regulation of connexin 43 and Kv4.2, and significantly decreased the inducibility and duration of AF. ACE2 overexpression could shift the renin\u2013angiotensin system balance towards the protective axis, attenuate cardiac fibrosis remodeling associated with up-regulation of MKP-1 and reduction of MAPKs activities, modulate tachypacing-induced ion channels and connexin remodeling, and subsequently reduce the inducibility and duration of AF.

This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u20133.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u20132.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors.

Recent trials in infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) have not shown superiority of any natural surfactant over another. Advancements in the development of synthetic surfactants are promising, yet to date none has been shown to be superior to natural preparations. Ideally, surfactant would be administered without requiring mechanical ventilation. An increasing number of studies investigate the roles of alternative modes of administration and the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure to minimise the need for mechanical ventilation. Whether children with other lung diseases benefit from surfactant therapy is less clear. Evidence suggests that infants with meconium aspiration syndrome and children with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome may benefit, while no positive effect of surfactant is seen in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. However, more research is needed to establish potential beneficial effects of surfactant administration in children with lung diseases other than RDS. Furthermore, genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism have recently been linked to respiratory diseases of formerly unknown origin. It is important to consider these disorders in the differential diagnosis of unexplained respiratory distress although no established treatment is yet available besides lung transplantation for the most severe cases. Conclusion: Research around surfactant is evolving and recent developments include further evolution of synthetic surfactants, evaluation of surfactant as a therapeutic option in lung diseases other than RDS and the discovery of genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism. Ongoing research is essential to continue to improve therapeutic prospects for children with serious respiratory disease involving disturbances in surfactant.","publish_time":"2007-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Been, Jasper V.; Zimmermann, Luc J.

Standing on verge of exciting discoveries, research is being translated into therapies that are being widely administered to patients. Providing a hope for cure, where none existed before. This new body of knowledge has come from a better understanding of cancer genetics, molecular and sub molecular behavior, and understanding of cancer-generated cellular environments. These have led to development of immunotherapy and its many sub-genres, improvement and introduction of new radiation technologies, and decreasing toxicities of existing chemotherapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The purpose of this review is to have a summary look at this huge landscape of cancer therapy. Specially looking at toxicities that an anesthesiologist should be familiar with while providing perioperative care for these patients, complications like tumor lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndromes, Kounis syndrome, myocarditis, encephalopathies, and pituitary failure need to be kept in mind. SUMMARY: One should be knowledgeable about these therapies and approach these patients with a high index of suspicion. Anesthesiologists will need to refine preoperative assessment with appropriate testing and intraoperative and postoperative management in collaboration with oncologists, while involving the expertise of internists, cardiologist, and endocrinologists in helping assess and manage these patients in the perioperative period.","publish_time":"2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrabi, Tayab; French, Katy E.; Qazilbash, Muzaffar H.","journal":"Curr Anesthesiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/606bc511bc139e91071a5fa9171c71ac05a65ff6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","better understanding of cancer genetics","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","summary","huge landscape of cancer therapy","Kounis syndrome","molecular behavior","perioperative care","perioperative period","tumor lysis syndrome","new body of knowledge","toxicities of existing chemotherapies","introduction of new radiation technologies","cytokine release syndromes","myocarditis","complications","postoperative management","appropriate testing","improvement","preoperative assessment","sub-genres","encephalopathies","oncologists","collaboration","research","pituitary failure","cardiologist","expertise of internists","verge of exciting discoveries","high index of suspicion","development of immunotherapy","RECENT FINDINGS","endocrinologists","Anesthesiologists","cellular environments","rise","hope","cure","mind"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of advances in spinal surgery on patient outcomes in the treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis (SK). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SK is one of the most common causes of back pain in adolescents. Trends in diagnoses and surgical treatment and approach to SK have not been well described. METHODS: SK patients aged 0\u201320 years in KID were identified by ICD-9 code 732.0. KID-supplied year- and hospital-trend weights were used to establish prevalence. Patient demographics, surgical details, and outcomes were analyzed with analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 1,070 SK patients were identified (33.2% female), with increasing incidence of SK diagnosed from 2003 to 2012 (3.6\u20137.5 per 100,000, p \u003C .001). The average age of operative patients was 16.1\u00B12.0 years and did not change (16.27\u201316.06 years, p = .905). The surgical rate has not changed over time (72.8%\u201372.8%, p = .909). Overall, 96.3% of operative patients underwent fusion, with 82.2% of cases spanning \u2A7E4 levels; in addition, 8.6% underwent an anterior-only surgery, 74.6% posterior-only, and 13.6% combined approach. From 2003 to 2012, rates of posterior-only surgeries increased (62.4%\u201384.4%, p \u003C .001) whereas the rate of combined-approach surgeries decreased (37.6%\u20138.8%, p \u003C .001). Overall complication rates for SK surgeries have decreased (2003: 20.9%; 2012: 11.9%, p = .029). Concurrently, the rate of \u2A7E4-level fusions has increased (43.5%\u201389.6%, p \u003C .001), as well as the use of Smith-Peterson (7.8%\u201323.6%, p \u003C .001) and three-column osteotomies (0.0%\u20132.7%, p = .011). In subanalysis comparing posterior to combined approaches, complication rates were significantly different (posterior: 9.88%, combined: 19.46%, p = .005). Patients undergoing a combined approach have a longer length of stay (LOS) than patients undergoing a posterior-only approach (7.8 vs. 5.6 days, p \u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite unchanged demographics and operative rates in SK, there has been a shift from combined to isolated posterior approaches, with a concurrent increase in levels treated. A combined approach was associated with increased complication rates, LOS, and total charges compared to isolated approaches. Awareness of these inherent differences is important for surgical decision making and patient education.

RESULTS: Twenty patients with infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) \u22652 \u03BCg/ml] were compared with 102 patients harboring levofloxacin-susceptible strains; 80 % of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were resistant to \u22653 antibiotics but susceptible to penicillin. Most levofloxacin-resistant strains (80 %) belonged to serotype 8. In comparison, only 8 % of levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci belonged to serotype 8. In the multivariate analysis, residence in public shelters [odds ratio (OR) 26.13; p 0.002], previous hospitalization (OR 61.77; p \u003C 0.001), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR 28.14; p = 0.009), and heavy smoking (OR 14.41; p = 0.016) were associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. Mortality caused by levofloxacin-resistant and levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci was 35 and 14 %, respectively. Among HIV-positive individuals infected with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci 44 % died, but only 12.5 % of HIV-positive patients with levofloxacin-susceptible strains died. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of invasive disease caused by levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae. HIV-positive patients seem to be prone to infection caused by multidrug-resistant serotype 8 and have a high mortality rate.","publish_time":"2013-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Isea-Pe\u00F1a, M.

Similar clots form in the Rivalta\u0027s test, a method with high diagnostic accuracy for FIP. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy for FIP and the optimal cutoff of \u0394TNC. METHODS: After a retrospective search of our database, DIFF and BASO counts, and the \u0394TNC from cats with and without FIP were compared to each other. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR\u002B, LR\u2212) were calculated. A ROC curve was designed to determine the cutoff for best sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Effusions from 20 FIP and 31 non\u2010FIP cats were analyzed. The \u0394TNC was higher (P \u003C .001), and BASO and DIFF counts were lower (P \u003C .001 and P \u003C .05) in FIP than in non\u2010FIP cats. Only 2 FIP cats with atypical effusions had a \u0394TNC \u003C 3.0. The cutoff identified by the ROC curve (area under curve: 0.94; P \u003C .001) was 1.7 (Sensitivity = 90.0%; Specificity = 93.53%; LR\u002B = 13.9; LR\u2212 = 0.1). A \u0394TNC \u003E 2.5 had 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The \u0394TNC has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP\u2010related effusions by providing an estimate of precipitable proteins, as the Rivalta\u0027s test, in addition to the cell count. As fibrin clots result in false lower BASO counts, the \u0394TNC is preferable to the WBC count generated by the BASO channel alone in suspected FIP effusions.","publish_time":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giordano, Alessia; Stranieri, Angelica; Rossi, Gabriele; Paltrinieri, Saverio","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f623f86fb07c7ec79b7f6444446859849e260192.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169253.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25847704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DIFF","BASO","Sysmex","FIP","WBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected FIP effusions","non\u2010FIP cats","optimal cutoff of \u0394TNC","LR","specificity","BASO channel","BASO reagent","DIFF counts","false lower BASO counts","high diagnostic accuracy","related effusions","atypical effusions","fibrin clots","ROC curve","Rivalta\u0027s test","best sensitivity","Similar clots form","WBC count","cell count","total nucleated cells","negative likelihood ratios","database","feline infectious peritonitis","estimate of precipitable proteins","retrospective search","addition","study","area","\u0394WBC","Sysmex XT","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Compliance with infection control guidelines for influenza in the ED is generally unknown, and effective yet low-resource training is needed to educate staff on the importance of decreasing the potential for ED transmission of the virus. Objectives: This study evaluates compliance with patient assignment and transport precautions for influenza in an urban ED before and after implementation of electronic reminders. Methods: We included patients with a diagnosis of influenza for two consecutive influenza seasons, and retrospectively collected limited patient encounter data on patient location, transport, and compliance with assignment and transport precautions for both years. For the second influenza season we sent monthly reminders to all ED providers via the electronic medical record (EMR), explaining the importance and proper use of infection control precautions in patients with suspected influenza. Compliance between the two seasons was compared using descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis. Results: Overall compliance with infection control precautions was poor, but increased with the use of electronic reminders from 29% to 45% (p = 0.015). Compliance with precautions for patients moved to the hallway or Radiology increased from 7% to 24% (p = 0.001). Conclusions: The EMR may be a useful tool for improving compliance with transmission-based precautions by implementing reminders on order sets and informational mailings, and by tracking compliance.

Virus isolation attempts were carried out on a large panel of different cell types including primary pig kidney cells and lung macrophages, primary rabbit kidney cells and seven established cell lines (MARC-145, ST117, PK15, BHK21, HeLa, Vero, and MDCK). Although these represent cells with susceptibility to a wide range of known viruses, the results did not provide evidence for a specific virus other than PCV2 contributing to the development of PMWS. Furthermore, in order to test whether specific genotypes of PCV2 may trigger the switch from PCV2 infection to clinical disease, we compared complete DNA genome sequences of PCV2 derived from PMWS-positive as well as PMWS-negative pigs. On the basis of the DNA sequences, the PCV2 isolates were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisting of one isolate originating from a herd unaffected by PMWS, with group 2 consisting of nine isolates originating from four PMWS-affected herds, four PMWS-positive pigs plus one unaffected herd. The PCV2 genomes from the two groups showed 95.5% identity. Alignment analyses of the sequences encoding the replicase and capsid protein from group 1 and group 2 PCV2 isolates showed two amino acid differences encoded in the replicase protein, while 19 amino acid differences were predicted among the capsid protein sequences. The PCV2 DNA sequence analysis supports recent observations from studies in USA as well as Europe, which suggest that strain variations may influence the clinical outcome of PCV2 infection.","publish_time":"2008-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lohse, Louise; B\u00F8tner, Anette; Hansen, Anne-Sofie Ladekj\u00E6r; Frederiksen, Tina; Dupont, Kitt; Christensen, Charlotte S.; B\u00E6kbo, Poul; Nielsen, Jens","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f219eb4d0ac169c5086c666a306f32a7d911c2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131108.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811350700572X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811350700572X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMWS","MDCK","Group"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["PCV2 isolates","development of PMWS","PCV2 genomes","PMWS-positive pigs","PMWS-negative pigs","specific genotypes of PCV2","complete DNA genome sequences of PCV2","PCV2 DNA sequence analysis","clinical outcome of PCV2 infection","DNA sequences","capsid protein sequences","Danish PMWS-transmission study","replicase protein","primary pig kidney cells","primary rabbit kidney cells","amino acid differences","herd unaffected","unaffected herd","specific virus","groups","isolate originating","order","clinical disease","established cell lines","development of postweaning multisystemic","Virus isolation attempts","large panel of different cell types","lung macrophages","recent observations","extensive virological examinations","studies","organ material","switch","HeLa","PK15","ST117","wide range of known viruses","hypothesis","putative co-factor","MARC","syndrome","viral origin","Vero","Europe","results","BHK21","USA","strain variations","susceptibility","herds","evidence","Alignment analyses","MDCK","Abstract","basis","identity"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe vaccine against the divergent H5N1 influenza viruses. In the present study, we designed a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)-based vaccine, designated M2e-MAP, which contains the sequence overlapping the highly conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of a HPAI H5N1 virus, and investigated its immune responses and cross-protection against different clades of H5N1 viruses. RESULTS: Our results showed that M2e-MAP vaccine induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses following 3-dose immunization of mice with M2e-MAP in the presence of Freunds\u0027 or aluminium (alum) adjuvant. M2e-MAP vaccination limited viral replication and attenuated histopathological damage in the challenged mouse lungs. The M2e-MAP-based vaccine protected immunized mice against both clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus challenge, being able to counteract weight lost and elevate survival rate following lethal challenge of H5N1 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that M2e-MAP presenting M2e of H5N1 virus has a great potential to be developed into an effective subunit vaccine for the prevention of infection by a broad spectrum of HPAI H5N1 viruses.","publish_time":"2010-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Guangyu; Lin, Yongping; Du, Lanying; Guan, Jie; Sun, Shihui; Sui, Hongyan; Kou, Zhihua; Chan, Chris CS; Guo, Yan; Jiang, Shibo; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5db7954926b0072fa6bf086899e4faf42c15f3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2823673.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20082709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M2e-MAP vaccine","M2e-MAP presenting M2e of H5N1 virus","M2e-MAP vaccination","designated M2e-MAP","divergent H5N1 influenza viruses","lethal challenge of H5N1 viruses","different clades of H5N1 viruses","broad spectrum of HPAI H5N1 viruses","based vaccine","H H5N1 virus challenge","safe vaccine","RESULTS","effective subunit vaccine","strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses","immune responses","immunized mice","pandemic potential","great potential","pathogenic avian influenza","dose immunization of mice","attenuated histopathological damage","viral replication","cross-protection","prevention of infection","survival rate","conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein","tetra","clade1","multiple antigenic peptide","SZ","challenged mouse lungs","aluminium","VN","weight","sequence","presence of Freunds","growing concern","clade2","urgent need","present study","adjuvant","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that human IFITM3 did not affect the assembly and morphogenesis of progeny adenovirus. Human IFITM3 can be expressed in both A549 and MDCK cells in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, cells infected with rAd5-IFITM3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for 24 h were challenged with avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 at an MOI of 1 for 6, 12 and 24 h.

Because of their origin in the bat enteric system, we wondered if severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also use bacterial components to modulate infectivity. To test this question, we incubated CoVs with LPS and PG and evaluated infectivity, finding no change following LPS treatment. However, PG from Bacillus subtilis reduced infection \u003E10,000-fold, while PG from other bacterial species failed to recapitulate this. Treatment with an alcohol solvent transferred inhibitory activity to the wash, and mass spectrometry revealed surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, as the inhibitory compound. This antibiotic had robust dose- and temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that surfactin disrupts CoV virion integrity, and surfactin treatment of the virus inoculum ablated infection in vivo. Finally, similar cyclic lipopeptides had no effect on CoV infectivity, and the inhibitory effect of surfactin extended broadly to enveloped viruses, including influenza, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, Una, Mayaro, Dugbe, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Overall, our results indicate that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin has broad viricidal activity and suggest that bacteria by-products may negatively modulate virus infection. IMPORTANCE In this article, we consider a role for bacteria in shaping coronavirus infection. Taking cues from studies of enteric viruses, we initially investigated how bacterial surface components might improve CoV infection. Instead, we found that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin is a potent viricidal compound that disrupts virion integrity with broad activity against enveloped viruses. Our results indicate that interactions with commensal bacterial may improve or disrupt viral infections, highlighting the importance of understanding these microbial interactions and their implications for viral pathogenesis and treatment.","publish_time":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Bryan A.; Hage, Adam; Kalveram, Birte; Mears, Megan; Plante, Jessica A.; Rodriguez, Sergio E.; Ding, Zhixia; Luo, Xuemei; Bente, Dennis; Bradrick, Shelton S.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Popov, Vsevolod; Rajsbaum, Ricardo; Rossi, Shannan; Russell, William K.; Menachery, Vineet D.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f833af06053cca5a1e610c8d959c43c250afd801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6819921.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01282-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PG"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","surfactin treatment","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","bacterial components","coronavirus infection","PG","CoV virion integrity","peptidoglycan-associated surfactin","inhibitory effect of surfactin","LPS treatment","enveloped viruses","studies of enteric viruses","inhibitory activity","bacterial surface components","bacterial species","temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","broad activity","inhibitory compound","evaluated infectivity","virus inoculum ablated infection","broad viricidal activity","results","IMPORTANCE","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses","potent viricidal compound","cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic","bat enteric system","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","bacteria by-products","viral pathogenesis","microbial interactions","viral infections","Mechanistic studies","similar cyclic lipopeptides","Nipah","chikungunya","Dugbe","wash","Zika","Una","Mayaro","Ebola","implications","mass spectrometry","lipopolysaccharides","robust dose","alcohol solvent","influenza","CoVs","role","change","fold","Bacillus subtilis","origin","cues","article","question","humans"],"language":"en"},

However, because the number of temporary shelters is insufficient, as are shelter building capabilities, victims must be evacuated and resettled in batches. The perceived psychological penalty to victims may increase due to heightened panic when waiting for evacuation and resettlement, whereas psychological interventions can decrease the magnitude of this panic. Based on the susceptible\u2013infective-removal model, panic spread among homeless victims and other disaster-affected people is modeled, while considering the effects of psychological interventions on panic spread. A function is derived to compute the increase in the number of victims to be evacuated due to panic spread. A novel mixed-integer linear program is constructed for multi-step evacuation and temporary resettlement under minimization of panic-induced psychological penalty cost, psychological intervention cost, and costs associated with transportation and building shelters. The model is solved by aggregating objectives into a single objective by assigning weights to these objectives. With Wenchuan County as the test case, the epicenter of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the influence and the sensitivity of parameters, tradeoff among costs, and the effects of various functions of panic strength on psychological penalty and monetary costs are assessed using six experimental scenarios. Analytical results reveal the complexity and managerial insights gained by applying the proposed method to post-disaster evacuation and temporary resettlement.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Zhi-Hua; Sheu, Jiuh-Biing; Xiao, Ling","journal":"Transportation Research Part B: Methodological","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c39de4602343eff8fc68e576b3e38336b3ddb71.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261514001398; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261514001398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["panic spread","minimization of panic","number of victims","heightened panic","psychological penalty cost","perceived psychological penalty","effects of psychological interventions","psychological intervention cost","temporary resettlement sites","number of temporary shelters","huge number of homeless victims","effects of various functions of panic strength","post-disaster evacuation","monetary costs","increase","multi-step evacuation","aggregating objectives","building capabilities","infective-removal model","proposed method","novel mixed-integer linear program","managerial insights","single objective","sensitivity of parameters","test case","epicenter","influence","complexity","tradeoff","Sichuan earthquake","Analytical results","Wenchuan County","weights","transportation","magnitude","experimental scenarios","Abstract","people","batches"],"language":"en"},

IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) plays a crucial role in innate immune responses. Here, we demonstrate that PRRSV infection did not induce IFN-\u03B2 gene transcription in MARC-145 cells, but inhibited poly (I:C) stimulated IFN-\u03B2 gene transcription instead. Such inhibition is time-dependent with the progression of PRRSV infection. We also show that the inhibition of IFN-\u03B2 transcription in the early stage of infection could not be due to inhibition of phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, though significant decrease of p-IRF3 and its nuclear translocation in PRRSV-infected and poly (I:C) cells was observed later at 48h post-infection. The different patterns of inhibition for IFN-\u03B2 transcription and IRF3 phosphorylation have important implications as to the mechanism(s) by which PRRSV suppresses the type I IFN signaling at early stage of infection.

Arbidol (umifenovir) is a broad-spectrum antiviral compound approved in Russia and China for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. This compound shows activities against numerous DNA and RNA viruses. The mode of action is based predominantly on impairment of critical steps in virus-cell interactions. Here we demonstrate that arbidol possesses micromolar-level anti-viral effects (EC(50) values ranging from 10.57 \u00B1 0.74 to 19.16 \u00B1 0.29 \u00B5M) in Vero cells infected with Zika virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, three medically important representatives of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses. Interestingly, no antiviral effects of arbidol are observed in virus infected porcine stable kidney cells (PS), human neuroblastoma cells (UKF-NB-4), and human hepatoma cells (Huh-7 cells) indicating that the antiviral effect of arbidol is strongly cell-type dependent. Arbidol shows increasing cytotoxicity when tested in various cell lines, in the order: Huh-7 \u003C HBCA \u003C PS \u003C UKF-NB-4 \u003C Vero with CC(50) values ranging from 18.69 \u00B1 0.1 to 89.72 \u00B1 0.19 \u00B5M.

The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) specifically designed to detect FCoV spike gene mutations at two nucleotide positions. It was hypothesized that this test would correctly discriminate feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). METHODS: The study included 63 cats with signs consistent with FIP. FIP was confirmed in 38 cats. Twenty-five control cats were definitively diagnosed with a disease other than FIP. Effusion and/or serum/plasma samples were examined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the two FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058 L and S1060A using an allelic discrimination approach. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples. In effusion, sensitivity was 68.6% (95% CI 50.7\u201383.2), specificity was 95.8% (95% CI 78.9\u201399.9). No serum/plasma samples were positive for FIPV. CONCLUSIONS: Although specificity of the test in effusions was high, one false positive result occurred. The use of serum/plasma cannot be recommended due to a low viral load in blood.","publish_time":"2017-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Felten, Sandra; Leutenegger, Christian M.; Balzer, Hans-Joerg; Pantchev, Nikola; Matiasek, Kaspar; Wess, Gerhard; Egberink, Herman; Hartmann, Katrin","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05ab8bd6ff732bea31fa673b450d37b58da78c46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5541694.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1147-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","FIPV","FIPV/FECV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specificity","effusion samples","control cats","FCoV spike gene mutations","Feline coronavirus","plasma samples","sensitivity","real-time RT-PCR","feline enteric coronavirus","FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058","feline infectious peritonitis virus","study","mixed population of FIPV","test","FECV","use of serum","positive predictive values","false positive result","chronic kidney disease","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","S1060A","pathotypic switch","effusions","pathotypes","confidence intervals","nucleotide positions","signs consistent","pathogenesis","allelic discrimination approach","low viral load","blood","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although poorly understood, NS1 multimerization may autoregulate its actions. While RBD dimerization seems functionally conserved, two possible apo ED dimers have been proposed (helix-helix and strand-strand). Here, we analyze all available RBD, ED, and full-length NS1 structures, including four novel crystal structures obtained using EDs from divergent human and avian viruses, as well as two forms of a monomeric ED mutant. The data reveal the helix-helix interface as the only strictly conserved ED homodimeric contact. Furthermore, a mutant NS1 unable to form the helix-helix dimer is compromised in its ability to bind dsRNA efficiently, implying that ED multimerization influences RBD activity. Our bioinformatical work also suggests that the helix-helix interface is variable and transient, thereby allowing two ED monomers to twist relative to one another and possibly separate. In this regard, we found a mAb that recognizes NS1 via a residue completely buried within the ED helix-helix interface, and which may help highlight potential different conformational populations of NS1 (putatively termed \u2018helix-closed\u2019 and \u2018helix-open\u2019) in virus-infected cells. \u2018Helix-closed\u2019 conformations appear to enhance dsRNA binding, and \u2018helix-open\u2019 conformations allow otherwise inaccessible interactions with host factors. Our data support a new model of NS1 regulation in which the RBD remains dimeric throughout infection, while the ED switches between several quaternary states in order to expand its functional space. Such a concept may be applicable to other small multifunctional proteins.","publish_time":"2011-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kerry, Philip S.; Ayllon, Juan; Taylor, Margaret A.; Hass, Claudia; Lewis, Andrew; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Randall, Richard E.; Hale, Benjamin G.; Russell, Rupert J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fad5703e838cae052bc9cd18b32ea812b942fb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3065461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21464929/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017946","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["RBD","ED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ED helix-helix interface","helix-helix dimer","helix-open","ED switches","ED monomers","NS1 multimerization","monomeric ED mutant","ED multimerization influences RBD activity","full-length NS1 structures","virus NS1 protein","mutant NS1 unable","conserved ED homodimeric contact","possible apo ED dimers","available RBD","RBD dimerization","new model of NS1 regulation","potential different conformational populations of NS1","conformations","dsRNA binding","data","strand-strand","RNA binding domain","effector domain","novel crystal structures","multifunctional virulence factor","small multifunctional proteins","virus-infected cells","EDs","divergent human","order","inaccessible interactions","short linker","avian viruses","quaternary states","forms","infection","residue","host factors","mAb","Influenza","ability","functional space","C-terminal","tail","concept","bioinformatical work","regard"],"language":"en"},

The application of broad-spectrum, sequence independent virus discovery techniques may be useful to reduce this proportion and widen our knowledge about respiratory pathogens. Thanks to the availability of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, it became today possible to detect viruses which are present at a very low load, but the clinical relevance of those viruses must be investigated. In this study we used VIDISCA-454, a restriction enzyme based virus discovery method that utilizes Roche 454 HTS system, on a nasal swab collected from a subject with respiratory complaints. A \u03B3-papillomavirus was detected (complete genome: 7142 bp) and its role in disease was investigated. Respiratory samples collected both during the acute phase of the illness and 2 weeks after full recovery contained the virus. The patient presented antibodies directed against the virus but there was no difference between IgG levels in blood samples collected during the acute phase and 2 weeks after full recovery. We therefore concluded that the detected \u03B3-papillomavirus is unlikely to be the causative agent of the respiratory complaints and its presence in the nose of the patient is not related to the disease. Although HTS based virus discovery techniques proved their great potential as a tool to clarify the etiology of some infectious diseases, the obtained information must be subjected to cautious interpretations. This study underlines the crucial importance of performing careful investigations on viruses identified when applying sensitive virus discovery techniques, since the mere identification of a virus and its presence in a clinical sample are not satisfactory proofs to establish a causative link with a disease.","publish_time":"2014-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canuti, Marta; Deijs, Martin; Jazaeri Farsani, Seyed M.; Holwerda, Melle; Jebbink, Maarten F.; de Vries, Michel; van Vugt, Saskia; Brugman, Curt; Verheij, Theo; Lammens, Christine; Goossens, Herman; Loens, Katherine; Ieven, Margareta; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af6cc29d9bc7f9d84ded3d7ad30509a945e425d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4086198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071755/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus discovery method","sensitive virus discovery techniques","Respiratory samples","respiratory complaints","respiratory pathogens","sequence independent virus discovery techniques","proportion of respiratory diseases","viruses","causative agent","HTS system","acute phase","causative link","presence","weeks","detected \u03B3-papillomavirus","patient","recovery","study","blood samples","infectious diseases","clinical sample","clinical relevance","unexpected pathogens","throughput sequencing","satisfactory proofs","difference","application of broad-spectrum","restriction enzyme","great potential","Roche","mere identification","availability of high","obtained information","careful investigations","crucial importance","nasal swab","low load","IgG levels","bp","technology","subject","illness","complete genome","tool","etiology","VIDISCA","nose","knowledge","cautious interpretations","Thanks","role","antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Twenty-five PRRSV-seronegative piglets were used. At 1 day of age, pigs were administered with a single dose of vaccine via the IM (n = 10) or the IN route (n = 10). Control group (n = 5) received saline solution. After vaccination, pigs were bled at days 3, 7, 28, 56, 83, 113 and 125. Levels of cytokines IL-10, IL-8, IFN-\u03B1 (measured by ELISA tests of serum), TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3 (measured by ELISA and ELISPOT, respectively, from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and serum neutralising antibodies (NA) to the vaccine strain, were measured. RESULTS: The induction of IL-10 was rare, indicating that IL-10 mediated immunomodulation/immune dysfunction was not a feature of this vaccine or of the challenge virus. IL-8 was detected in only two pigs following vaccination, but in the majority of pigs after challenge, indicating that their ability to produce an innate immune response was not impaired. TNF-\u03B1 was not detected in any vaccinated pigs until day 83. After challenge, only a minority of pigs produced TNF-\u03B1. IFN-\u03B1 was detected in all vaccinated pigs following vaccination, indicating the potential for development of an effective Th1 adaptive immune response. IFN-\u03B3-secreting cells were detected in all vaccinated pigs after vaccination. NA to the vaccine strain were first detected at day 56 in pigs vaccinated by both routes, and remained at similar levels until challenge. After challenge, a boost in NA was observed. The efficacy of the vaccine was demonstrated by reduction of viraemia and nasal shedding after challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of a PRRSV-1 based MLV vaccine to 1 day-old piglets was able to induce an immune response characterised by: (1) undetectable or low levels of IL-10, IL-8 and TNF-\u03B1, (2) an increase in IFN-\u03B1 expression within the first seven days, (3) a gradual increase in the number of antigen-specific IFN-\u03B3-secreting cells, and (4) induction of detectable NA. After challenge with a heterologous strain, there was a rapid boost in NA titres, indicating a priming effect of the vaccine.","publish_time":"2019-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balasch, Monica; Fort, Maria; Taylor, Lucas P.; D\u00EDaz, Ivan; Mateu, Enric; Calvert, Jay G.","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe14106f9f3d2b3b6d8ea619cfcc4363148dc84b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6359793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761215/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-018-0112-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccinated pigs","day-old pigs","vaccine strain","challenge virus","TNF-\u03B1","minority of pigs","majority of pigs","IFN-\u03B1 expression","induction of IL","based MLV vaccine","low levels of IL","Levels of cytokines IL","heterologous PRRSV","innate immune response","specific IFN-\u03B3","single dose of vaccine","immune dysfunction","adaptive immune responses","PRRSV-seronegative piglets","weeks post-vaccination","secreting cells","NA titres","heterologous strain","effective Th1 adaptive immune response","development","day-old piglets","similar levels","days","day of age","routes","based modified live virus","respiratory syndrome virus","ELISA tests of serum","gradual increase","rapid boost","induction of detectable","stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells","serum neutralising antibodies","number of antigen","isolate","potential","reduction of viraemia","ELISPOT","nasal shedding","priming effect","mediated immunomodulation","ability","administration","feature","Control group","saline solution","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","efficacy"],"language":"en"},

Virus neutralization (V/N) assays are commonly requested in diagnostic laboratories for the assessment of protective antibodies. However, the visual assessment of viral cytopathic effects by operators to determine antibody titers or for viral quantification is a tedious, subjective and time-consuming process, especially when high volume testing is involved. To improve the ease of testing, a colorimetric virus neutralization and TCID50 assays were developed and validated in this study using (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) Tr-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium- bromide) (MTT), a colorimetric agent which measures cell viability. The respective conventional assays were used as the gold standards. An OD cut off value of \u22640.53, selected by receiver operating characteristics analysis, could distinguish between wells with and without CPE accurately. Performance and reproducibility parameters of the colorimetric assays were comparable to the conventional assays. The described methods can reduce testing time in diagnostic laboratories, while significantly improving current protocols.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Pankaj; Singh, Gagandeep; Karsky, Jenna; Nelson, Eric; Ramamoorthy, Sheela","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/502b6e42269746a0cfe5c3dbbab5620b466b9569.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418303173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218684/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418303173","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["colorimetric assays","TCID50 assays","colorimetric virus neutralization","respective conventional assays","colorimetric agent","diagnostic laboratories","testing time","high volume testing","ease of testing","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","viral quantification","visual assessment of viral cytopathic effects","assessment of protective antibodies","important cause of high mortality","economic losses","PEDV","operators","antibody titers","time-consuming process","reproducibility parameters","Abstract Neonatal enteritis","MTT","diphenyltetrazolium- bromide","swine industry","described methods","wells","characteristics analysis","cell viability","Performance","current protocols","gold standards","receiver","dimethylthiazol","value","CPE","study"],"language":"en"},

Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). METHODS: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p \u003C 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p \u003C 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p \u003C 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.

VCP functions in several cellular processes, including protein degradation, membrane fusion, vesicular trafficking and disassembly of stress granules. Moreover, VCP is considered to play a role in the replication of several viruses, albeit through different mechanisms. In the present study, we have investigated the role of VCP in West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Endogenous VCP expression was inhibited using either VCP inhibitors or by siRNA knockdown. It could be shown that the inhibition of endogenous VCP expression significantly inhibited WNV infection. The entry assay revealed that silencing of endogenous VCP caused a significant reduction in the expression levels of WNV-RNA compared to control siRNA-treated cells. This indicates that VCP may play a role in early steps either the binding or entry steps of the WNV life cycle. Using WNV virus like particles and WNV-DNA-based replicon, it could be demonstrated that perturbation of VCP expression decreased levels of newly synthesized WNV genomic RNA. These findings suggest that VCP is involved in early steps and during genome replication of the WNV life cycle.","publish_time":"2017-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phongphaew, Wallaya; Kobayashi, Shintaro; Sasaki, Michihito; Carr, Michael; Hall, William W.; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2f08bdfcdba926fb1ff4ea020a35269b24575bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114552.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216305147; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216305147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VCP","WNV"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["role of VCP","VCP inhibitors","VCP functions","perturbation of VCP expression","WNV virus","silencing of endogenous VCP","inhibition of endogenous VCP expression","expression levels of WNV","WNV-DNA","WNV life cycle","inhibited WNV infection","synthesized WNV genomic RNA","entry steps","early steps","protein degradation","ATPase protein family","entry assay","genome replication","siRNA knockdown","West Nile virus","control siRNA-treated cells","vesicular trafficking","membrane fusion","significant reduction","binding","cellular processes","type","AAA","particles","disassembly of stress granules","viruses","based replicon","member","Abstract Valosin","different mechanisms","present study","findings"],"language":"en"},

All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules. A large number of viral inclusion bodies as seen containing dark smooth particles 120 nm in diameter within a single membrane. Virus was readily recovered from the kidneys as well as faeces of birds with acute and chronic nephritis. It is concluded that direct virus-induced cell lysis is the primary cause of IBV nephritis. In addition, about 50 per cent of the chronically infected birds also developed brush-border auto-antibody.","publish_time":"1982-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, K.

The canonical MHV receptor CEACAM1a and its spike-binding site have been extensively characterized. However, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in neurons, and the extremely neurotropic MHV strain JHM.SD infects ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 mice and spreads among ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 neurons. Two proposed alternative MHV receptors, CEACAM2 and PSG16, also fail to account for neuronal spread of JHM.SD in the absence of CEACAM1a. JHM.SD has been reported to have an unusually labile spike protein, enabling it to perform receptor-independent spread (RIS), but it is not clear that the ability to perform RIS is fully responsible for the extremely neurovirulent phenotype. We propose that the extreme neurovirulence of JHM.SD is multifactorial and might include as-yet unidentified neuron-specific mechanisms of spread.","publish_time":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillips, Judith M.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Trends in Pharmacological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c61479064273b0fa74a8511f91bf18bbd8147b89.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1ce61f0e462ac4bde7fee6429e3a872256a0ca6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3022387.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614710002014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2010.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144598/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165614710002014; http://www.cell.com/article/S0165614710002014/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canonical MHV receptor CEACAM1a","absence of CEACAM1a","spike-receptor interactions","receptor-independent spread","receptor availability","neurotropic MHV strain","RIS","neuronal spread of","neurons","proposed alternative MHV receptors","spike-binding site","labile spike protein","neurotropic strains","coronavirus tropism","extreme neurovirulence of","unidentified neuron-specific mechanisms of spread","murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","CEACAM2","PSG16","spreads","evidence","mice","neurovirulent phenotype"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To assess the travel health care needs of Chinese residents in Hong Kong by examining travel health problems of returning Hong Kong residents and by understanding their use of travel health services before or after travel. Methods Review of available data followed by a cross-sectional telephone survey of 280 travellers and 15 service providers. A structured pre-tested questionnaire was used for data collection. Household members, who were ethnic Chinese, aged 15\u201364 years, able to communicate in Cantonese, and who had travelled at least once during the preceding 12 months were invited to participate. Results There was a scarcity of travel medicine services in Hong Kong. The most common destinations for travellers were countries in the Asia-Pacific region, especially mainland China (33%). Twenty percent of the respondents developed health problems during or shortly after travel. Although only 9% of respondents had received pre-travel health advice, 61% used some form of precautions. Twelve percent had lost at least a day due to travel-related health problems. The service providers agreed that there are demands for travel health services. However, half of the service providers had not been trained in travel or tropical medicine. Conclusions This study indicates the need for specialized travel medicine services in Hong Kong to improve the health of travellers.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdullah, Abu Saleh M.; Hamer, Davidson H.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6efa8d982d72816606d1fb26e57a0e75dd628bfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106142.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893906000020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893906000020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["travel health problems","use of travel health services","travel-related health problems","travel-related health risks","pre-travel health advice","use of travel medicine services","specialized travel medicine services","scarcity of travel medicine services","health of travellers","travel health care needs of Chinese residents","Hong Kong residents","service providers","tropical medicine","respondents","percent","ethnic Chinese","available data","data collection","structured pre-tested questionnaire","countries","Asia-Pacific region","cross-sectional telephone survey","marked increase","study","day","mainland China","years","Household members","common destinations","Objectives","Cantonese","Conclusions","Methods","half","Results","Summary Background","form of precautions","months"],"language":"en"},

Limited information is available on the etiology and clinical characteristics of the influenza-like illness (ILI) that ensued in adults following the pH1N1 pandemic. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of ILI in adults was collected. A total of 279 throat swabs were tested for twelve respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical characteristics of influenza A in outpatients versus test-negative patients were compared using Pearson\u0027s \u03C72 and the Mann-Whitney U test. 190 swabs were tested for pH1N1 by virus isolation. Consultation rates for ILI were compared between 2009 and 2010. RESULTS: One or two virus were detected in 29% of the samples. Influenza A virus (FLU-A) accounted for 22.9% (64/279). Other viruses were present at a frequency less than 3.0%. Cough was significantly associated with Influenza A virus infection (\u03C72, p\u003C0.001). The positive rate of FLU-A was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in 2010 when compared to 2009. During the 2010\u20132011 influenza season, the incidence peaked in January 2011 in Beijing and north China. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to pH1N1 had no impact on typical influenza seasonal peaks, although FLU-A remained the predominant virus for 2010 in Beijing.

Analysis of the S1 gene showed that isolate I1101/16 was genetically close to strain ck/CH/LJL/140901, which belongs to the TW I genotype (also known as lineage GI-7 based on the recent IBV classification), however the S2 gene showed genetic diversity comparing to that of S1 gene. Comparison of the genomic sequences showed that the genome of isolate I1101/16 was similar to that of strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 from the 5\u2032 end of the genome to the 5\u2032 end of the S2 gene and from the 5\u2032 end of the 3a gene to the end of the genome, whereas the remaining parts of the genome sequences were more closely related to those of strain 4/91 than those of ck/CH/LJL/140901, thereby suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. SimPlot and Bootscan analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, where it showed that isolate I1101/16 arose through recombination events between ck/CH/LJL/140901- and 4/91-like viruses. Isolate I1101/16 and strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 shared identical amino acids in almost all five of their B cell epitopes, but the two viruses had a serotype relatedness value of 65, which is well below 80, i.e., the lower cutoff value for viruses of the same serotype. In addition, pathogenicity tests demonstrated that isolate I1101/16 was more pathogenic to 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens than strain ck/CH/LJL/140901, according to analysis of the clinical signs, whereas strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 exhibited prolonged replication and shedding after challenge compared with isolate I1101/16. This study did not provide evidence that recombination can directly alter the antigenicity, virulence, replication, shedding, and tissue tropism of a virus, but it did show that recombination events are likely to be major determinants of viral evolution.","publish_time":"2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Lei; Han, Zongxi; Chen, Yuqiu; Zhao, Wenjun; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f63d830bc5c88a85c5cec59a4ba2c5cbc46f5dc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141204/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.11.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217307098; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217307098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SimPlot"],"organizations":["TW"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["LJL","strain ck","genome of isolate I1101","designated I1101","end","S2 gene","S1 gene","recombination events","genome sequences","viruses","Bootscan analysis","genomic sequences","shedding","study","infectious bronchitis virus","serotype relatedness value","prolonged replication","complete genomic sequence","lower cutoff value","free chickens","day-old specific-pathogen","major determinants of viral evolution","shared identical amino acids","genetic diversity","clinical signs","hypothesis","tissue tropism","antigenicity","remaining parts","pathogenicity tests","challenge","broiler breeders","recent IBV classification","SimPlot","virulence","addition","B cell epitopes","China","Comparison","evidence","origin","lineage GI","Abstract","TW"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated infrared thermography (IRT) and compared the influence of different imagers, ambient temperature discrepancy, and the distance between the subject and imager. Methods IRT-digital infrared thermal imaging (IRT-DITI), thermoguard, and ear drum IRT were used for visitors to Municipal Wang Fang Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The McNemar and c2 test, standard Pearson correlation, ANOVA, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to calculate the alarm temperature for each imager. Results A total of 1032 subjects were recruited. Different distances and ambient temperature discrepancy had a significant influence on thermoguard, and lateral and frontal view DITI. By ICC analysis, a significant difference was found at 10 m distance between ear drum IRT and thermoguard (r = 0.45), lateral view DITI (r = 0.37), and frontal view DITI (r = 0.44). With ROC analysis, the optimal preset cut-off temperatures for the different imagers were: 36.05\u00B0C for thermoguard (area under the curve [AUC], 0.716), 36.25\u00B0C for lateral view DITI (AUC, 0.801), and 36.25\u00B0C for frontal view DITI (AUC, 0.812). Conclusion The temperature readings obtained by IRT may be used as a proxy for core temperature. An effective IRT system with a strict operating protocol can be rapidly implemented at the entrance of a hospital during SARS or avian influenza epidemics.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Ming-Fu; Lin, Po-Wei; Lin, Li-Fong; Chiou, Hung-Yi; Chien, Ching-Wen; Chu, Shu-Fen; Chiu, Wen-Ta","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60aa58e759985165053ddd6f154ea42518143056.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664609600176; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0929-6646(09)60017-6; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664609600176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19129054/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRT","Municipal Wang Fang Hospital","ICC","DITI"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["IRT-DITI","lateral view DITI","frontal view DITI","thermoguard","ear drum IRT","effective IRT system","ambient temperature discrepancy","temperature readings","alarm temperature","core temperature","AUC","ICC analysis","ROC analysis","influence of different imagers","Methods IRT-digital infrared thermal imaging","SARS","significant influence","Different distances","avian influenza epidemics","infrared thermography","significant difference","characteristic curve","standard Pearson correlation","intraclass correlation coefficient","strict operating protocol","Municipal Wang Fang Hospital","ANOVA","visitors","optimal preset cut-off temperatures","c2 test","severe acute respiratory syndrome","patients","Taipei","receiver","Purpose Detection of fever","McNemar","Taiwan","area","essential step","Background","study","proxy","Conclusion","entrance","total","subjects"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we apply perspectives from the ecology of infectious diseases to model the transmission of HCV among a population of injection drug users. The products of our model suggest that modelling HCV as an indirectly transmitted infection\u2014where the injection equipment serves as an environmental reservoir for infection\u2014facilitates a more nuanced understanding of disease dynamics, by animating the underappreciated actors and interactions that frame disease. This lens may allow us to understand how certain public health interventions (e.g. needle exchange programmes) influence HCV epidemics. Lastly, we argue that this model is of particular importance in the light of the modern opioid epidemic, which has already been associated with outbreaks of viral diseases.","publish_time":"2019-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller-Dickson, Miles D.; Meszaros, Victor A.; Almagro-Moreno, Salvador; Brandon Ogbunugafor, C.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63d069bab41ecd46a0c6462f46f27844322cad61.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ff2a6501716b8ff2b5e96ef3034f15309ce90c43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6769301.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480919/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV outbreak","modelling HCV","transmission of HCV","influence HCV epidemics","needle injection equipment","various actors","population of injection drug users","persistence of injection drug use","modern opioid epidemic","underappreciated actors","transmitted infection","various aspects","particular importance","nuanced understanding of disease dynamics","Mathematical models","needle exchange programmes","ecology of infectious diseases","outbreaks of viral diseases","importance of new treatment measures","viruses","hosts","certain public health interventions","light","perspectives","environmental reservoir","hepatitis C virus","interactions","terms","products","study","lens"],"language":"en"},

Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31(st) December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms. AIM: To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made. METHOD: Contacts were identified and risk categorized as \u2018close\u2019 or \u2018casual\u2019 for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of \u2018close contact\u2019. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, S.C.-Y.; Kwong, R.T.-S.; Wu, T.C.; Chan, J.W.M.; Chu, M.Y.; Lee, S.Y.; Wong, H.Y.; Lung, D.C.","journal":"J Hosp Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128692.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32259546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120301742?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120301742","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["staff close contacts","COVID","patient close contacts","contact precautions","remaining contacts","airborne precautions","surveillance period","day surveillance","medical surveillance","contact tracing","placement of patients","airborne infection isolation rooms","transmission-based precautions","airborne route","FINDINGS","SARS-CoV","vigilant basic infection control measures","nosocomial transmissions","respiratory symptoms","Respiratory specimens","surgical masks","public hospitals","hospital settings","general ward","hand","environmental hygiene","quarantine","outbreak investigation","droplet","criteria","different cities","outside China","open cubicle","decisions","BACKGROUND","Coronavirus disease","healthcare facilities","recommendations","fever","total","risk","tests","diagnosis","AIM","Hong Kong","CONCLUSION","METHOD","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections, and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other \u002BRNA viruses, coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome and employ a complex genome expression strategy. Next to a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the coronavirus-host interplay. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication, by altering host gene expression or by counteracting the host\u2019s antiviral defenses. These coronavirus\u2013host interactions are key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine the outcome of infection. Due to the complexity of the coronavirus proteome and replication cycle, our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other \u002BRNA viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of coronavirus\u2013host interactions at the level of the infected cell, with special attention for the assembly and function of the viral RNA-synthesising machinery and the evasion of cellular innate immune responses.","publish_time":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Wilde, Adriaan H.; Snijder, Eric J.; Kikkert, Marjolein; van Hemert, Martijn J.","journal":"Roles of Host Gene and Non-coding RNA Expression in Virus Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95e99eed4e794ba4370f856d066c8d7a1910bc46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28643204/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2017_25","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus replication","coronavirus-host interplay","coronavirus infections","coronavirus proteome","coronavirus proteins","host interactions","host cell","current understanding of coronavirus","host gene expression","knowledge of host factors","replication cycle","RNA viruses","basic virus replication","zoonotic coronaviruses","infected cell","severe acute respiratory syndrome","virus assembly","respiratory disease","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","viral RNA-synthesising machinery","serious impact","likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses","large genome","societal impact","viral pathogenesis","complex genome expression strategy","SARS","function","evasion of cellular innate immune responses","MERS","special attention","options","key","optimal environment","level","animal health","case","pathogens","role","host\u2019s antiviral defenses","humans","review","complexity","life threatening","early stage","outcome of infection","importance","example"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Observational. SETTING: Thirty-three Boston-area LTCFs over a 3-year period. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of long-term care who had previously participated in a trial of vitamin E supplementation and had paired serum samples available for viral analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Viral antibody titers to eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus serotype three (PIV-3), PIV-2, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and coronaviruses 229E and OC43) were measured using enzyme immunoassay at baseline and 53 weeks. Infection was defined as a more than quadrupling of viral titers. Clinical data on respiratory illnesses were collected throughout the study period. RESULTS: A total of 617 persons were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 382 (62%) had sera available for viral analysis. A total of 204 viral infections were documented in 157 subjects. Serological responses to all eight viruses were documented, with hMPV (12.8%) and coronavirus 229E (10.5%) being the most common and PIV-2 (2.4%) the least common.

It was previously shown that a major determinant of PS recognition is the second of the two RNA-binding domains of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein.

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all subjects and analyzed by isolation in cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for C. pneumoniae. Serum samples were also obtained and tested for C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies by the microimmunofluorescence test. Results C. pneumoniae was isolated from two (1.2%) asthma patients and none from controls and detected by PCR from nine (5.4%) cases and one (0.9%) control. Both culture positive specimens were also positive in PCR. Further, serologic evidence of acute C. pneumoniae infection was present in 15 (8.9%) of asthma patients and in three (2.8%) of controls (P = .048). The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA was significantly higher in asthma cases than in controls (IgG \u003E/= 1:16; 85.1% versus 67.6%, P = .001; IgA \u2265 1:16: 47.6% versus 16.7%, P \u003C .001). Mean titer of IgG and IgA was also significantly greater in asthma cases than in controls (IgG: 38.8 versus 18.1, P = .0001; IgA: 17.2 versus 6.1, P = .0001). Conclusion Our data suggest that C. pneumoniae infection may trigger acute exacerbations of adult asthma.","publish_time":"1998-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miyashita, Naoyuki; Kubota, Yoshifumi; Nakajima, Masamitsu; Niki, Yoshihito; Kawane, Hiroshi; Matsushima, Toshiharu","journal":"Annals of Allergy, Asthma \u0026 Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97b6a39ead50c95e88f17df017120527462b2110.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1081120610629924; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120610629924","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["Background Chlamydia","C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA","IgG and IgA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma patients","asthma cases","acute exacerbations of asthma","acute exacerbations of adult asthma","pneumoniae-specific IgG","pneumoniae infections","IgA","controls","pneumoniae-specific antibodies","adult patients","Background Chlamydia pneumoniae","possible case of asthma","PCR","serologic evidence of acute","culture positive specimens","control subjects","Mean titer of IgG","prevalence of","frequent causative agent of acute respiratory disease","cell culture","microimmunofluorescence test","Nasopharyngeal swab specimens","polymerase chain reaction","sex","isolation","smoking status","data","Conclusion","Methods","Serum samples","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

A 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. The management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations, making it difficult to compare producers\u2019 cost to benchmark. The objective of this project was to develop a model to calculate the cost of rearing a replacement heifer from birth to weaning under different housing, milk source, allotments, and labor and health management decisions to be used as a dairy farm decision support tool. We calculated the cost for management options with general cost values. We found that the average feed cost represented 46% of the total cost while labor, and fixed and variable costs represented 33%, 9%, and 12%, respectively. The total cost increased as milk allotment increased, but cost per Kg of gain decreased. The ranges in total cost within each management scenario often exceed the difference in cost from one scenario to the next. In conclusion, variable costs have the potential to vary among operations, playing a major role in the total cost of rearing replacements from birth to weaning. ABSTRACT: Dairy calves are raised in various housing and feeding environments on dairy farms around North America. The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. In this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0\u20132 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. The decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. Costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. A 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @Risk and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. As milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. Feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. Average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively. Total pre-weaning costs ranged from $258.56 to $582.98 per calf across all management scenarios and milk allotments.","publish_time":"2019-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hawkins, Anna; Burdine, Kenneth; Amaral-Phillips, Donna; Costa, Joao H.C.","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3e92ff23f71052b519afe647c6d69f0bf1b8e0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6680651.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9070471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["total feed cost","lower cost","producers\u2019 cost","total cost of rearing replacements","general cost values","Average feed cost percentage","Total pre-weaning costs","Dairy calves","management of replacements","different management decisions","management options","management scenarios","health management decisions","replacement dairy heifers","milk source","milk allotments","weaning age","variable costs","replacement female calves","different housing","dairy farms","replacement heifer","heifer herd","replacement female heifers","higher allowance of milk","labor utilization","herd sizes","milking herd","simulation model","pre-weaning mortality rate","different inputs","various housing","dairy farm decision support tool","birth","year period","operations","gain","objective","year investment period","iteration economic simulation","months of age","liquid diet source","Palisade Corporation","PrecisionTree add-ons","reflective of published surveys","Ithaca","account","variation","environments","Risk","literature","NY","USA","biological responses","critical importance","influence","major role","North America","genetic quality","potential","difference","market conditions","disease prevalence","SIMPLE SUMMARY","benchmark","study","conclusion","calf","ranges","project","ABSTRACT","max"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT: Background: Respiratory viruses may persist in the airways of asthmatics between episodes of clinical worsening. We hypothesized that patients with clinically stable, severe asthma exhibit increased and more prolonged viral presence in the airways as compared to mild asthmatics and healthy controls. Methods: Thirty\u2010five subjects (no cold symptoms \u003E4 weeks) entered a 12\u2010week prospective study using three groups: clinically stable mild asthma (GINA 2) (n = 12, age 34.1 \u00B1 13.4 year), severe asthma (GINA 4) (n = 12, age 49.3 \u00B1 14.8 year) and healthy controls (n = 11, age 37.9 \u00B1 14.2 year). All subjects underwent spirometry and completed a written questionnaire on asthma symptoms at baseline. Nasal and throat swabs, induced sputum samples, exhaled breath condensate and gelatine\u2010filtered expired air were analysed at 0, 6 and 12 weeks by a multiplex real\u2010time PCR assay for 14 respiratory viruses using adequate positive and negative controls. Results: Thirty\u2010two of 525 patient assessments (6%) showed a virus\u2010positive sample. Among the 14 respiratory viruses examined, HRV, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 3\u00264, human bocavirus, influenza B and coronavirus were detected. When combining all sampling methods, on average 18% of controls and 30% of mild and severe asthmatics were virus positive, which was not different between the groups (P = 0.34). The longitudinal data showed a changing rather than persistent viral presence over time. Conclusion: Patients with clinically stable asthma and healthy controls have similar detection rates of respiratory viruses in samples from nasopharynx, sputum and exhaled air. This indicates that viral presence in the airways of stable (severe) asthmatics varies over time rather than being persistent.","publish_time":"2011-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turchiarelli, V.; Schinkel, J.; Molenkamp, R.; Foschino Barbaro, M.

In tackling both the new and old viruses as they emerge, humanized mice will continue to be an indispensable tool.","publish_time":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaska, Jenna M.; Ploss, Alexander","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37ac9afdc92c360ec50d7b387e9c61e8da2e7715.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a7623f036aa4a693078f106cdb8263b40c0c72d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4456257.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625715000036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25618248/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625715000036; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2015.01.002; https://manuscript.elsevier.com/S1879625715000036/pdf/S1879625715000036.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["humanized mice","viral infections","viral pathogens","study","viral life cycle","hepatotropic viruses","host responses","old viruses","improvement of humanized mouse models","testing candidate therapies","development of clinical therapies difficult","improved analysis of human immune responses","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","humans","outlet","cost effective","years","researchers\u2019 abilities","identification of factors crucial","infectious disease","restricted species tropism","HIV","pathogenesis","ethical manner","tackling","indispensable tool"],"language":"en"},

Although supplanted by labeled leukocyte imaging for most indications, gallium-67 remains useful for opportunistic infections, pulmonary inflammation and interstitial nephritis and, when [(18)F]FDG is not available, spinal infection and fever of unknown origin. In vitro labeled leukocyte imaging is the radionuclide procedure of choice for most infections in immunocompetent patients. When performed for musculoskeletal infection, complementary bone marrow imaging usually is necessary. Recent data suggest that dual time point imaging might be an alternative to marrow imaging. Several methods of labeling leukocytes in vivo, with agents including antigranulocyte antibodies and antibody fragments, peptides and cytokines, have been investigated, with variable results. These agents are not widely available and none of them are available in the USA. Radiolabeled antibiotics have been investigated as \u201Cinfection-specific\u201D tracers, but the results to date have been disappointing. Conversely, radiolabeled antimicrobial peptides do hold promise as infection-specific tracers. The use of positron-emitting tracers for diagnosing inflammation and infection has generated considerable interest. [(18)F]FDG is useful in fever of unknown origin, spinal osteomyelitis, vasculitis and sarcoidosis. Other positron-emitting tracers that have been investigated include [(18)F]FDG-labeled leukocytes, copper-64-labeled leukocytes, gallium-68 citrate and iodine-124 FIAU. Although radiolabeled tracers are used primarily for diagnosis, they also offer objective biomarkers for assessing response to therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases. They could also potentially be used to target cells and molecules with specific receptor expression for histological characterization, select patients for receptor-targeted therapy and predict response to treatment.","publish_time":"2013-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palestro, Christopher J.; Glaudemans, Andor W.

This study is to determine if BMI extremes are associated with increased 28-day mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) patients presenting with severe sepsis. We performed a retrospective chart review at an urban, level I trauma center of adults admitted with severe sepsis between 1/2005 and 10/2007, and collected socio-demographic variables, comorbidities, initial and most severe vital signs, laboratory values, and infection sources. The primary outcome variables were mortality and LOS. We performed bivariable analysis, logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression to determine the association between BMI, mortality, and LOS. Amongst 1,191 severe sepsis patients (median age, 57 years; male, 54.7 %; median BMI, 25.1 kg/m(2)), 28-day mortality was 19.9 % (95 % CI 17.8\u201322.4) and 60-day mortality was 24.4 % (95 % CI 21.5\u201326.5). Obese and morbidly obese patients were younger, less severely ill, and more likely to have soft tissue infections. There was no difference in adjusted mortality for underweight patients compared to the normal weight comparator (OR 0.74; CI 0.42\u20131.39; p = 0.38). The obese and morbidly obese experienced decreased mortality risk, vs. normal BMI; however, after adjustment for baseline characteristics, this was no longer significant (OR 0.66; CI 0.42\u20131.03; p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in LOS across BMI groups. Neither LOS nor adjusted 28-day mortality was significantly increased or decreased in underweight or obese patients with severe sepsis. Morbidly obese patients may have decreased 28-day mortality, partially due to differences in initial presentation and source of infection. Larger, prospective studies are needed to validate these findings related to BMI extremes in patients with severe sepsis.","publish_time":"2015-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaulton, Timothy Glen; Marshall MacNabb, C.; Mikkelsen, Mark Evin; Agarwal, Anish Kumar; Cham Sante, S.; Shah, Chirag Vinay; Gaieski, David Foster","journal":"Intern Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13f1fddd0f0f8aa06ddb4360b1cf456bfb7f7311.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["BMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["obese patients","day mortality","severe sepsis patients","underweight patients","adjusted mortality","LOS","normal BMI","median BMI","BMI extremes","obese experienced decreased mortality risk","BMI groups","severe vital signs","patient\u2019s body mass","Body mass index","muscle mass","significant difference","body fat percentage","logistic regression","initial presentation","median age","source of infection","infection sources","normal weight comparator","primary outcome variables","socio-demographic variables","restricted cubic spline regression","level","laboratory values","comorbidities","hospital length of stay","trauma center of adults","male","emergency department","differences","association","bivariable analysis","adjustment","years","indicator","findings","retrospective chart review","soft tissue infections","prospective studies","baseline characteristics","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The outcome of 137 patients who underwent OLT using donors after cardiac death (DCDs) for CSHB in our center was reviewed retrospectively. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method; the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis; and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for prognostic factors screening. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 33.6% (46/137); and 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year patient survival rates were 75.8, 72.0, 71.0, and 60.1%, respectively. Most patients (33/46) died during the first month after OLT. The area under the curve values generated by the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72\u20130.92] and 0.68 (95% CI 0.58\u20130.79), respectively (P \u003C 0.01), for the MELD and CTP models in predicting 1-month mortality after OLT. Patients with a preoperative MELD score \u003C33.8 or a CTP score \u003C12.5 had significantly better prognosis than those with higher scores (P \u003C 0.05). Other mortality predictors include hepatic encephalopathy, preoperative infection, serum creatinine \u22651.5 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: The MELD score was more efficient than the CTP score for evaluating the short-term prognosis in patients with CSHB undergoing OLT using DCDs, which should be taken into consideration during graft allocation.","publish_time":"2009-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Liang; Fu, Zhi-Ren; Ding, Guo-Shan; Fu, Hong; Ni, Zhi-Jia; Wang, Zheng-Xin; Shi, Xiao-Min; Guo, Wen-Yuan; Ma, Jun","journal":"World J Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b82d83469b9f1286f5c733bcc574747ea020805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSHB","OLT","CTP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CTP score","OLT","preoperative MELD score","patients","month mortality","CSHB","CTP models","preoperative model of end","preoperative infection","better prognosis","short-term prognosis","DCDs","mortality predictors","Survival analysis","prognostic factors","CI","overall mortality rate","univariate analysis","year patient survival rates","stage liver disease","othotopic liver transplantation","Cox proportional hazards regression model","hepatic encephalopathy","Child-Turcotte","chronic severe hepatitis B","log-rank test","cardiac death","donors","Pugh","Kaplan-Meier method","serum creatinine","receiver","higher scores","utility","curve values","study","characteristics curves","RESULTS","outcome","confidence interval","consideration","graft allocation","BACKGROUND","aim","area","METHODS","center","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

There are three norovirus genogroups infecting humans. These genogroups are divided based on the sequence of their major capsid protein, which is able to form virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed recombinantly. VLPs of the prototypical GI.1 Norwalk virus are known to disassemble into specific capsid protein oligomers upon alkaline treatment. Here, native mass spectrometry and electron microscopy on variants of GI.1 and of GII.17 were performed, revealing differences in terms of stability between these groups. Beyond that, these experiments indicate differences even between variants within a genotype. The capsid stability was monitored in different ammonium acetate solutions varying both in ionic strength and pH. The investigated GI.1 West Chester isolate showed comparable disassembly profiles to the previously studied GI.1 Norwalk virus isolate. However, differences were observed with the West Chester being more sensitive to alkaline pH. In stark contrast to that, capsids of the variant belonging to the currently prevalent genogroup GII were stable in all tested conditions. Both variants formed smaller capsid particles already at neutral pH. Certain amino acid substitutions in the S domain of West Chester relative to the Norwalk virus potentially result in the formation of these T = 1 capsids.","publish_time":"2018-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pogan, Ronja; Schneider, Carola; Reimer, Rudolph; Hansman, Grant; Uetrecht, Charlotte","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5687b9c53c830568b944c43c0d56a2d196150497.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104913.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["West Chester"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["variants of GI","Norwalk virus","capsid stability","differences","West Chester isolate","studied GI","investigated GI","prototypical GI","new variants","alkaline pH","smaller capsid particles","major capsid protein","specific capsid protein oligomers","neutral pH","capsids","VLPs","S domain of West Chester relative","alkaline treatment","terms of stability","prevalent genogroup GII","norovirus genogroups infecting humans","comparable disassembly profiles","electron microscopy","main cause of viral gastroenteritis","different ammonium acetate solutions","Certain amino acid substitutions","native mass spectrometry","variant belonging","ionic strength","sequence","formation","tested conditions","Noroviruses","stark contrast","experiments","genotype"],"language":"en"},

Miniaturization of key bio-diagnostic techniques, such as: nucleic acid detection and quantification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fingerprinting, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), results in substantial reduction of reaction volumes (expensive samples/reagents) and shorter reaction times. Droplet microfluidics (DMF) is one of several miniaturized bio-sample handling techniques available for manipulating clinical samples and reagents in microliter (10(\u22126) L) to picoliter (10(\u221212) L) volume regime. Electro-actuation of sample and reagent in the form of droplets in the aforementioned volume regime, using dielectrophoresis (DEP) and/or Electrowetting (EW) are achieved by means of patterned, insulated metal electrodes on one or more substrates. In this work, we have utilized electro-actuation based DMF technology, integrated with suitably tailored resistive micro-heaters and temperature sensors, to achieve chip based real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). This qRT-PCR micro-device was utilized to detect and quantify the presence of influenza A and C virus nucleic acids, using in-vitro synthesized viral RNA segments. The experimental analysis of the DMF micro-device confirms its capabilities in qRT-PCR based detection and quantification of pathogen samples, with accuracy levels comparable to established commercial bench-top equipment (PCR efficiency \u223C95%).

There were 49 patients in group A who underwent thoracoscopic surgery and 43 patients in group B who underwent conventional surgery. RESULTS: The mechanical ventilation time (55.7 \u00B1 11.4 h vs 75.6 \u00B1 19.2 h), intensive care time (3.6 \u00B1 1.8d vs 4.7 \u00B1 2.0d), postoperative hospitalization time (13.1 \u00B1 2.2d vs 16.8 \u00B1 4.3d), thoracic drainage volume (62.7 \u00B1 25.5 ml vs 125.4 \u00B1 46.1 ml), blood transfusion volume (30.5 \u00B1 10.4 ml vs 55.3 \u00B1 22.7 ml) and surgical incision length (2.0 \u00B1 0.5 cm vs 8.0 \u00B1 1.8 cm) in group A were lower than those in group B, and the differences were statistically significant (P \u003C 0.05).

Virus concentration prior to detergent treatment was best accomplished by ultracentrifugation or by a simple, less expensive, and more practical method involving acid (HCl) precipitation of NDV. Virus concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation was found to have a low antigen titer and was not considered suitable as an AGP antigen. Antigens derived from the LaSota, Roakin, and Texas GB strains formed at least two lines of identity in the AGP test as early as 24 hr after inoculation of the agar gels. Virus used for AGP antigen production could be grown in chicken embryos from an NDV-immune as well as susceptible breeder flock. The NDV AGP antigen was found to be stable after 20 consecutive freezing and thawing cycles and storage at \u221220 C or 4 C for at least 6 months. Detergent-treated NDV was used as an AGP test antigen to determine serum antibody responses of chickens following infection and vaccination. Hemagglutination-inhibition, virus neutralization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay antibody production was also evaluated for comparative purposes. The AGP test was found to be useful as an aid in diagnosing field infections and assessing inactivated virus vaccination responses. These purposes were achieved by demonstrating an increase in the number of AGP positive chickens between preinfection and postinfection or vaccination bleedings. The ease of performance and low cost of the AGP test favors its use for screening large numbers of serum samples, perhaps in conjunction with a quantitative serological test. Further, the AGP test may be useful in regions where limited facilities or technical capabilities preclude the use of other serological procedures.","publish_time":"1987-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"GELB, J.; CIANCI, C.G.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NDV","AGP","NDV AGP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDV AGP antigen","AGP test antigen","AGP antigen production","precipitation of NDV","concentrated NDV","virus neutralization","number of AGP positive chickens","Virus concentration","NDV-immune","Detergent-treated NDV","inactivated virus vaccination responses","quantitative serological test","low antigen titer","soluble Newcastle disease virus","serum antibody responses of chickens","use","vaccination bleedings","detergent treatment","nonionic detergent","agar gels","low cost","serological procedures","comparative purposes","enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay antibody production","agar gel precipitin","polyethylene glycol precipitation","screening large numbers of serum samples","preinfection","regions","diagnosing field infections","postinfection","technical capabilities","limited facilities","Roakin","Texas GB strains","consecutive freezing","thawing cycles","storage","acid","HCl","conjunction","lines of identity","hr","practical method","chicken embryos","LaSota","aid","increase","Hemagglutination-inhibition","ease of performance","susceptible breeder flock","inoculation","ultracentrifugation","Antigens","months"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: To understand the epidemiology of HAdV infections in Singapore, we studied 533 HAdV-positive clinical samples collected from 396 pediatric and 137 adult patients in Singapore from 2012 to 2018. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify HAdV genotypes, clonal clusters, and recombinant or novel HAdVs. RESULTS: The most prevalent genotypes identified were HAdV-B3 (35.6%), HAdV-B7 (15.4%), and HAdV-E4 (15.2%). We detected 4 new HAdV-C strains and detected incursions with HAdV-B7 (odds ratio [OR], 14.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1\u201352.0) and HAdV-E4 (OR, 13.6; 95% CI, 3.9\u201346.7) among pediatric patients over time. In addition, immunocompromised patients (adjusted OR [aOR], 11.4; 95% CI, 3.8\u201334.8) and patients infected with HAdV-C2 (aOR, 8.5; 95% CI, 1.5\u201348.0), HAdV-B7 (aOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2\u201310.9), or HAdV-E4 (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1\u20138.9) were at increased risk for severe disease.

We have used a recombinant retroviral expression vector encoding anglerfish prepro-SRIF-I to infect rat pituitary GH(3) cells. The aim of these studies was to investigate the intracellular storage and secretion of the total pool of endogenous GH compared to that of SRIF. Several clonal lines of GH(3) cells expressing high or low levels of SRIF were treated with TRH, forskolin, or depolarizing concentrations of potassium, and the levels of intracellular and secreted GH or SRIF were determined using highly sensitive RIAs. Approximately 65% of the total GH was secreted basally, whereas less than 20% of the SRIF-immunoreactive material was basally secreted. Forskolin treatment or potassium depolarization stimulated GH release, but only about 50% above basal levels. In contrast, SRIF secretion was stimulated approximately 5-fold in response to these secretagogues. Based on its lower basal rate of secretion compared to GH and its enhanced release in response to a variety of secretagogues, we conclude that the heterologously expressed SRIF is preferentially targeted to the regulated pathway in GH(3) cells.","publish_time":"1989-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fleischer, Norman; Liker, Harley; Stoller, Timothy; D\u0027Ambra, Russell; Shields, Dennis","journal":"Mol Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8514d26e8c5d9084df9b9e5f7eab28c8d7ba70f1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SRIF","GH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SRIF secretion","mature SRIF","secreted GH","total GH","low levels of SRIF","anglerfish prepro-SRIF","SRIF-immunoreactive material","heterologously expressed SRIF","rat pituitary GH","clonal lines of GH","potassium depolarization stimulated GH release","total pool of endogenous GH","cells","levels of intracellular","basal levels","response","lower basal rate of secretion","Forskolin treatment","enhanced release","intracellular storage","amino acids","amino acid peptide hormone","variety of secretagogues","signal peptide","larger precursor","depolarizing concentrations of potassium","recombinant retroviral expression vector","TRH","proregion","studies","carboxyl-terminus","fold","regulated pathway","sensitive RIAs","contrast","aim","Somatostatin"],"language":"en"},

The primary modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appear to be direct mucus membrane contact with infectious droplets and through exposure to formites. Knowledge of the survival characteristics of the virus is essential for formulating appropriate infection-control measures. Methods. Survival of SARS-CoV strain GVU6109 was studied in stool and respiratory specimens. Survival of the virus on different environmental surfaces, including a laboratory request form, an impervious disposable gown, and a cotton nondisposable gown, was investigated. The virucidal effects of sodium hypochlorite, house detergent, and a peroxygen compound (Virkon S; Antec International) on the virus were also studied. Results. SARS-CoV GVU6109 can survive for 4 days in diarrheal stool samples with an alkaline pH, and it can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for \u003E7 days at room temperature. Even at a relatively high concentration (10(4) tissue culture infective doses/mL), the virus could not be recovered after drying of a paper request form, and its infectivity was shown to last longer on the disposable gown than on the cotton gown. All disinfectants tested were shown to be able to reduce the virus load by \u003E3 log within 5 min. Conclusions. Fecal and respiratory samples can remain infectious for a long period of time at room temperature. The risk of infection via contact with droplet-contaminated paper is small. Absorbent material, such as cotton, is preferred to nonabsorptive material for personal protective clothing for routine patient care where risk of large spillage is unlikely. The virus is easily inactivated by commonly used disinfectants.","publish_time":"2005-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Mary Y. Y.; Cheng, Peter K. C.; Lim, Wilina W.

We evaluated the RSV fusion inhibitor presatovir in a randomized, double-blind, Phase II trial in HCT recipients with RSV upper respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Patients were stratified by lymphopenia (\u003C200/\u00B5L) and ribavirin use; were randomized, stratified by lymphopenia (\u003C200/\u03BCL) and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir at 200 mg or a placebo on Days 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17, and were followed through Day 28. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were the time-weighted average change in the nasal RSV viral load between Days 1 and 9 and the proportion of patients developing lower respiratory tract complications (LRTCs) through Day 28. RESULTS: From 23 January 2015 to 16 June 2017, 189 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (96 to presatovir and 93 to the placebo).

Although the pandemic has been contained, concerns over its recurrence remain. It is essential to identify specific diagnostic agents and antiviral vaccine candidates to fight this highly contagious disease. Methods: We generated 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein and used these to thoroughly map the N protein antigenic determinants. We identified the immunodominant antigenic sites responsible for the antibodies in sera from SARS patients and antisera from small animals and differentiated the linear from the conformational antibody-combining sites comprising the natural epitopes by use of yeast surface display. Results: We identified 5 conformational and 3 linear epitopes within the entire N protein; 3 conformational and 3 linear epitopes were immunodominant. The antibody responses to the N protein fragments in mammalian sera revealed that 3 regions of the N protein are strong antigenic domains. We expanded the specificity of the N protein epitope and identified 4 novel conformational epitopes (amino acids 1\u201369, 68\u2013213, 212\u2013341, and 337\u2013422). Conclusion: The antigenic structures identified for the SARS-CoV N protein, the epitope-specific mAbs, and the serum antibody profile in SARS patients have potential use in the clinical diagnosis and understanding of the protective immunity to SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Yunfei; Wan, Ying; Qiu, Li-wen; Zhou, Jingran; Ni, Bing; Guo, Bo; Zou, Qiang; Zou, Liyun; Zhou, Wei; Jia, Zhengcai; Che, Xiao-yan; Wu, Yuzhang","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c76c563c9ef0134403d98d23944419eb1a942774.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108199.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV N protein","N protein epitope","N protein fragments","entire N protein","N protein antigenic determinants","SARS patients","SARS coronavirus","conformational antibody","linear epitopes","novel conformational epitopes","natural epitopes","antigenic structures","epitope-specific mAbs","immunodominant antigenic sites responsible","antibody responses","strong antigenic domains","specific diagnostic agents","serum antibody profile","potential use","mammalian sera","monoclonal antibodies","use of yeast surface display","epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","antiviral vaccine candidates","worldwide threat","public health","clinical diagnosis","antisera","small animals","regions","nucleocapsid","economic stability","protective immunity","amino acids","Background","specificity","contagious disease","concerns","Methods","Conclusion","pandemic","recurrence","Results"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, values for the active form of enzyme were significantly lower, (p \u003C .001) in all three muscle types of 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. This age-related decline in glycogen synthase activity was not due to a reduction in the affinity of the enzyme for its activator (glucose-6-phosphate) and was independent of the concentration of substrate (UDP-glucose) in the assay system. Because similar age-related changes were seen when enzyme activity was expressed per milligram of muscle protein or per gram of muscle tissue, the fall in enzyme activity was not a simple function of an age-related decline in muscle mass.

To study a potential impact of the O-acetyl group on the overall conformation of the carbohydrate chain, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of oligosaccharide chain fragments of increasing length starting from the non-reducing end have been carried out for the first time in this study. They revealed a considerable loss in chain flexibility after addition of the internal N-acetylneuraminic acid onto the chain. Besides MD calculations with different dielectric constants, the conformational behaviour of the complete oligosaccharide chain of the 9-O-acetylated G(D1a) ganglioside was simulated in the solvents water and dimethyl sulfoxide. These solvents were also used in NMR measurements. The results of this study indicate that 9-O-acetylation at the terminal sialic acid does not influence the overall conformation of the ganglioside. An extended interaction analysis of energetically minimized conformations of G(D1a) ((e)Neu5,9Ac(2)) and G(D1a), obtained during molecular dynamics simulations, allowed assessment of the influence of the different parts of the saccharide chains on spatial flexibility. Noteworthy energetic interactions, most interestingly between the 9-O-acetyl group and the pyranose ring of N-acetylgalactosamine, were ascertained by the calculations. However, the strength of this interaction does not force the ganglioside into a conformation, where the 9-O-acetyl group is no longer accessible. Binding of G(D1a) ((e)Neu5,9Ac(2)) to proteins, which are specific for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, should thus at least partially be mediated by the presence of this group. To experimentally prove this assumption, a NMR study of 9-O-acetylated G(D1a) in the presence of an affinitypurified polyclonal IgG fraction from human serum with preferential binding to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid was performed.

The remarkable diversity of human infectious diseases that have been modeled in the macaque includes global, childhood, and tropical diseases as well as newly emergent, sexually transmitted, oncogenic, degenerative neurologic, potential bioterrorism, and miscellaneous other diseases. Historically, macaques played a major role in establishing the etiology of yellow fever, polio, and prion diseases. With rare exceptions (Chagas disease, bartonellosis), all of the infectious diseases in this review are of Old World origin. Perhaps most surprising is the large number of tropical (16), newly emergent (7), and bioterrorism diseases (9) that have been modeled in macaques. Many of these human diseases (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis E, bartonellosis) are a consequence of zoonotic infection. However, infectious agents of certain diseases, including measles and tuberculosis, can sometimes go both ways, and thus several human pathogens are threats to nonhuman primates including macaques. Through experimental studies in macaques, researchers have gained insight into pathogenic mechanisms and novel treatment and vaccine approaches for many human infectious diseases, most notably acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other infectious agents for which macaques have been a uniquely valuable resource for biomedical research, and particularly vaccinology, include influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, hepatitis E virus, papillomavirus, smallpox virus, Mycobacteria, Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia pestis, and Plasmodium species.

The strength of the phosphinic zinc binding and the occupancy of the S\u2032(2) subsite account for the 100\u2010fold increase in affinity of PL250 compared with the dipeptide\u2010derived inhibitor bestatin (K (i) = 4.1 \u00D7 10(\u22126) M). Accordingly, the removal of the C\u2010terminal phenylalanine of PL250 resulted in a large decrease in affinity (K (i) = 2.17 \u00D7 10(\u22127) M). Furthermore, it was observed that the C\u2010terminal carboxyl group of the inhibitor makes no direct interactions with the amino acids of the APN active site. Interestingly, PL250 exhibits the same inhibitory potency for E. coli APN and for mammalian enzymes, suggesting that the structure of the complex could be used as a template for the rational design of various human APN inhibitors needed to study the role of this aminopeptidase in various pathologies.","publish_time":"2009-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fourni\u00E9\u2010Zaluski, Marie\u2010Claude; Poras, Herv\u00E9; Roques, Bernard P.; Nakajima, Yoshitaka; Ito, Kiyoshi; Yoshimoto, Tadashi","journal":"Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/084c057974b2f90fa844d3b36fc01b5fe1204942.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1107/s090744490901779x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19622865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Aminopeptidase N","EC","Ph)CO","APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli APN","Glu320 of APN","affinity of PL250","APN active site","terminal phenylalanine of PL250","phosphinic moiety of PL250","pure aminophosphinic inhibitor PL250","O atoms","rational design of various human APN inhibitors","transition state","Escherichia coli","three\u2010dimensional structure","complex","Aminopeptidase N","derived inhibitor bestatin","amino acids","proposed role","various pathologies","catalytic site","phosphinic zinc binding","terminal carboxyl group","dipeptide","direct interactions","fold increase","Tyr381","template","occupancy","stabilization","mammalian enzymes","inhibitory potency","subsite account","large decrease","hydrogen bond","strength","hydrolysis reaction","enzymatic process","removal","His297","His301","nM","subsites","OH","CONH","Zn ion"],"language":"en"},

Dromedary camels have been implicated due to reports that some confirmed cases were exposed to camels. Risk factors for MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in humans are incompletely understood. This study aimed to describe the demographic characteristics, mortality rate, clinical manifestations and comorbidities with confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. METHODS: Retrospective chart review were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia who reported to the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Saudi Arabia and WHO between April 23, 2014 and August 31, 2015. Patients\u2019 charts were also reviewed for demographic information, mortality, comorbidities, clinical presentations, health care facility and presented with descriptive and comparative statistics using non parametric binomial test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Confirmed cases of male patients (61.1%) exceeded those of female patients (38.9%). Infections among Saudi patients (62.6%) exceeded those among non-Saudi patients (37.4%; P = 0.001). The majority of the patients were aged 21\u201340 years (37.4%) or 41\u201360 years (35.8%); 43 (22.6%) were aged \u003E61 years, and (8) 4.2% were aged 0\u201320 years. There was a difference in mortality between confirmed MERS-CoV cases (63.7% alive versus 36.3% dead cases, respectively). Furthermore, fever with cough and shortness of breath (SOB) (n = 39; 20.5%), fever with cough (n = 29; 15.3%), fever (n = 18; 9.5%), and fever with SOB (n = 13; 6.8%), were the most common clinical manifestations associated with confirmed MERS-CoV cases. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV is considered an epidemic in Saudi Arabia. The results of the present study showed that the frequency of cases is higher among men than women, in Saudi patients than non-Saudi, and those between 21 to 60 years are most affected. Further studies are required to improve the surveillance associated with MERS-CoV to get definite and clear answers and better understanding of the MERS-CoV outbreak as well the source, and route of infection transmission in Saudi Arabia.","publish_time":"2017-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aleanizy, Fadilah Sfouq; Mohmed, Nahla; Alqahtani, Fulwah Y.; El Hadi Mohamed, Rania Ali","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9774fe2b5e6e752ff1e59bd6b2e46d7815b4a49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5217314.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-2137-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28056850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["confirmed MERS-CoV cases","confirmed cases of MERS","MERS-CoV outbreak","Saudi Arabia","MERS coronavirus","non-Saudi patients","Confirmed cases of male patients","years","frequency of cases","dead cases","fever","female patients","comorbidities","clinical presentations","common clinical manifestations","mortality rate","SOB","cough","RESULTS","infections","demographic characteristics","demographic information","Chi-square test","Ministry of Health","present study","Dromedary camels","parametric binomial test","health care facility","better understanding","women","comparative statistics","clear answers","source","Middle East respiratory syndrome","route of infection transmission","shortness of breath","BACKGROUND","MOH","Risk factors","epidemic","Retrospective chart review","METHODS","surveillance","laboratory","reports","humans","difference","Patients\u2019 charts","CONCLUSION","zoonotic disease","studies","majority"],"language":"en"},

These viruses exhibit divergent patterns of neutralization with BTV 17-specific monoclonal antibodies. The six L2 genes of the BTV 17 field isolates all encode a protein of 955 amino acids. Similarity of the nucleotide sequences of the L2 genes with respect to the prototype strain ranges between 93.8% and 95.1%, whereas the similarity between the field isolates ranges from 96.8% to 99.1%. Although very closely related, the L2 gene of each virus is distinct. Furthermore, mutations in the L2 gene of field isolates of BTV do not consistently follow a linear pattern of accumulation over time. Some amino acid changes in the VP2 protein of field strains were conserved over time, whereas others were not correlated with the year of isolation and some substitutions were unique to individual viruses. The predicted VP2s constitute a group of non-identical, but closely related proteins.

This study demonstrated that a commonly used cholesterol-lowering statin medication, simvastatin, which increases HuNoV replication in an in vitro replicon system, also enhances HuNoV infectivity in the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model. In contrast, oral treatment with interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 reduces HuNoV infectivity. Young piglets, all with A or H1 histo-blood group antigens on enterocytes, were treated orally with 8 mg/kg/day of simvastatin; 5 days later, the pigs were inoculated orally with a GII.4 HuNoV (HS194/2009/US strain) and then treated with simvastatin for 5 more days. Simvastatin induced significantly earlier onset and longer duration of HuNoV fecal shedding in treated pigs, frequently with higher fecal viral titers. Simvastatin impaired poly (I:C)-induced IFN-\u03B1 expression in macrophages or dendritic cells, possibly due to lowered toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expression; however, the mechanisms were not related to interferon regulatory factor 3 or nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Thus, the enhanced, earlier infectivity of HuNoV in simvastatin-treated pigs coincided with the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on innate immunity. In contrast to the increased HuNoV shedding that simvastatin induced, viral shedding during the treatment period was reduced or curtailed in the HuNoV-inoculated pigs pre-treated/treated with human IFN-\u03B1. Our findings are the first to indicate that IFN-\u03B1 has potential as antiviral therapy against HuNoV. Based on these intriguing and novel findings using the Gn pig model, we confirmed that HuNoV infectivity is altered by treatment with simvastatin or IFN-\u03B1. Collectively, these findings indicate that Gn pigs are a useful model to test immunomodulators or efficacy of antivirals against HuNoV.","publish_time":"2012-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Wang, Qiuhong; Kim, Yunjeong; Scheuer, Kelly; Zhang, Zhenwen; Shen, Quan; Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b1fca9311e0efc4368f3775dd878f57c5978a5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3402445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22911825/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041619","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HuNoV infectivity","HuNoV replication","increased HuNoV","HuNoV-inoculated pigs","simvastatin-treated pigs","earlier infectivity of HuNoV","day of simvastatin","Gn pigs","human IFN-\u03B1","longer duration of HuNoV fecal shedding","induced IFN-\u03B1 expression","inhibitory effect of simvastatin","Simvastatin impaired poly","Gn pig model","useful model","animal model","viral shedding","oral treatment","treatment period","novel findings","contrast","days","interferon regulatory factor","earlier onset","higher fecal viral titers","human norovirus","nuclear factor kappa B","macrophages","dendritic cells","H1 histo-blood group antigens","immunomodulators","potential","replicon system","gnotobiotic","lowered toll","used cholesterol","statin medication","antiviral therapy","enterocytes","receptor","TLR","pathway","innate immunity","HS194","efficacy of antivirals","mechanisms","US strain","lack","intriguing","GII","development of therapeutic strategies","study","Young piglets"],"language":"en"},

The combination of natural ventilation and window can also facilitate the removal or dilution of gaseous pollutants from indoor sources in newly decorated buildings. However, the windows on the same facade may cause gaseous pollutant cross-transmission during single-sided natural ventilation between households on different floors close to the source. Although some research has focused on the pollutant cross-transmission in buildings, the simplification of windows into rectangular openings often affects accurate knowledge of pollutant transmission characteristics. Therefore, this investigation explored gaseous pollutant cross-transmission through real windows during single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation in a multistory building. Six types of windows were modeled for the indoor pollutant of gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilized to solve characteristics of pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building. The results indicated that the ventilation rates, thermal profiles and pollutant transmission inside and outside the building varied for each window type, although the open window areas were identical. The re-entry ratio of exhausted air entering upper floors and the infection risk of epidemic viruses caused by airborne cross-transmission was sensitive to ventilation rates and window configurations, while the sensitivities for window configurations varied case by case.

There are no available data in temporal trends of vaccination coverage rates in both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines among Thai patients with T2DM. AIM: This study aimed to elucidate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination trends and to identify factors that affect vaccination rates in those patients. METHOD: A retrospective study of randomly medical records stratified by 13 diabetologists was conducted in patients with T2DM from 2010-2018 at Theptarin Hospital, a private multi-disciplinary diabetes center in Bangkok. Adherence to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations according to current guidance on adult immunization in Thailand had been studied. The rate of both vaccinations from each diabetologist had also been recorded. RESULTS: A total of 2,114 medical records (female 51.7%, mean age 65.2\u00B112.8 years, BMI 26.5\u00B14.6 kg/m(2), A1C 7.1\u00B11.3%, median duration of diabetes 13 years) were retrospectively reviewed covering a 9-year period. We audited 3,554 selected outpatient visits for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations rates as key performance index in each year. The overall vaccination rate was 39.6% for influenza, 17.4% for the pneumococcal vaccine, and only 13.7%, for both vaccines. The trends of influenza vaccination rates increased from 32.9% in 2010 to 52.2% in 2018 but the trends of pneumococcal vaccination rates were relatively stable at less than 20%. The rate of both vaccinations varied considerably from 0-44% among our diabetologists. Age \u2265 65 years, duration of DM \u2265 15 years, the presence of chronic respiratory disease, and moderate to severe Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were positively associated with both received vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: The completeness and timeliness of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were unsatisfactory in Thai patients with T2DM. More efforts are needed to increase both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yotsapon, Thewjitcharoen; Siriwan, Butadej; Areeya, Malidaeng; Nalin, Yenseung; Soontaree, Nakasatien; Nampetch, Lekpittaya; Worawit, Kittipoom; Sirinate, Krittiyawong; Thep, Himathongkam","journal":"J Clin Transl Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/090a67641b3f6a9170a75d00795a0ac9d83b8945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395432/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcte.2020.100227; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623720300430?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214623720300430","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangkok","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["pneumococcal vaccination trends","pneumococcal vaccinations rates","trends of pneumococcal vaccination rates","trends of influenza vaccination rates","pneumococcal vaccines","timeliness of influenza","Thai patients","Routine vaccination","temporal trends of vaccination coverage rates","pneumococcal vaccine coverage","overall vaccination rate","T2DM","years","diabetes mellitus","tertiary diabetes center","median duration of diabetes","private multi-disciplinary diabetes center","type","medical records","diabetologists","Bangkok BACKGROUND","retrospective study","mean age","year period","key performance index","severe Charlson Comorbidity Index","current guidance","presence of chronic respiratory disease","Theptarin Hospital","female","Experience","selected outpatient visits","adult immunization","factors","preventive services","available data","Thailand","score","total","completeness","Adherence","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHOD","BMI","A1C","AIM","efforts"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough, and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air bronchogram sign.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Rui; Huang, Lu; Jiang, Hong; Dong, Jin; Peng, Hongfen; Zhang, Dongyou","journal":"AJR.

In this paper, we review the current status of the main technologies used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of antigen-sensitized animals. While companies are adopting advanced high-throughput methods, the major technologies used by veterinary and medical research laboratories are classical hybridoma fusion and recombinant library selection techniques. These methods have inherent advantages and limitations but have many common aspects when using immunized rodents. Laboratories with expertise in both methods of antibody development have a distinct advantage in their ability to advance mAb technology. New and re-emerging infectious threats in today\u2019s world emphasize the need for quality immunoreagents and the need to maintain expertise in mAb development. We provide examples of some common applications for mAb reagents used to identify pathogens such as the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bacillus anthracis, and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. We also outline a framework for investigators to make rational decisions concerning which method to use to develop mAbs based upon characteristics of the pathogen under study and the intended downstream application. Lastly, we provide parameters for the immunisation of mice and a classification system which describes the expected outcome for mAb development strategies when using classes of immunogens to generate mAbs with desired activities.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Jody D.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15b31097cbeb02a3a799b458f9d1c933f47bc082.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110446.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023304001273; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023304001273","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["methods of antibody development","mAbs","mAb development strategies","mAb reagents","choice of methods","mAb technology","need","expertise","advanced high-throughput methods","major technologies","main technologies","SARS-CoV","common aspects","SARS-coronavirus","common applications","infectious threats","infectious agents","medical research laboratories","classical hybridoma fusion","recombinant library selection techniques","today\u2019s world","expected outcome","classes of immunogens","study","classification system","B cells of antigen","quality immunoreagents","limitations","distinct advantage","monoclonal antibodies","rational decisions","mouth disease","immunisation of mice","foot","sensitized animals","current status","Bacillus anthracis","ability","pathogens","intended downstream application","inherent advantages","framework","investigators","FMD","companies","immunized rodents","desired activities","characteristics","examples","parameters"],"language":"en"},

Yet, while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and (ii) that an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.","publish_time":"2017-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voinson, Marina; Alvergne, Alexandra; Billiard, Sylvain; Smadi, Charline","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d618a596def847bdfc19991c694e09bdeccf2287.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0fa11949267aed97bb69fdf1c76ab426d21a9290.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/213579","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human transmission","zoonotic diseases","emerging human infectious diseases","modes of transmission","importance of spillover transmission","incidental host","importance of animal","dynamics of zoonotic pathogens","single-host processes","consideration of direct transmission","dynamics of emerging infectious diseases","epidemiological processes","zoonotic species","humans","animal origin","model","susceptible individuals","epidemic","primary reservoir","multiple outbreaks","size of outbreaks","simple stochastic Susceptible-Infected","recurrent infection","theoretical studies","demographics","number","pathogen evolution","animals","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, entries captured by Public Health England\u2019s (PHE) manual event-based EI system were examined to inform future intelligence gathering activities. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of unique events captured in a database between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. The top five diseases in terms of the number of entries were described in depth to determine the effectiveness of PHE\u2019s EI surveillance system compared to other sources. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2017, a total of 22 847 unique entries were added to the database. The top three initial and definitive information sources varied considerably by disease. Ebola entries dominated the database, making up 23.7% of the total, followed by Zika (11.8%), Middle East respiratory syndrome (6.7%), cholera (5.5%), and yellow fever and undiagnosed morbidity (both 3.3%). Initial reports of major outbreaks due to the top five disease agents were picked up through the manual system prior to being publicly reported by official sources.

Vaccine-induced immune protection correlates with the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies but also opsonising antibodies have been proposed as an important mechanism of the immune response contributing to virus clearance by macrophages and leading to the production of type-I interferon (IFN) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). The present study demonstrates that the opsonising antibody titres mediating enhanced IFN-\u03B1 responses in pDC were similar to neutralizing titres, when antigenically related viruses from the same serotype were employed. However, sera cross-reacted also with non-neutralized isolates of multiple serotypes, when tested in this assay. Both uncomplexed virus and immune complexed virus stimulated pDC via Toll-like receptor 7. An additional finding of potential importance for strain-specific differences in virulence and/or immunogenicity was that pDC activation by FMDV strongly differed between viral isolates. Altogether, our results indicate that opsonising antibodies can have a broader reactivity than neutralizing antibodies and may contribute to antiviral responses induced against antigenically distant viruses.","publish_time":"2012-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lannes, Nils; Python, Sylvie; Summerfield, Artur","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a6f367d81903273daadb6e142149f2feff80d6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3479418.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-43-64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22934974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Picornaviridae","Toll-like","FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["opsonising antibodies","immune complexed virus stimulated pDC","uncomplexed virus","virus clearance","pDC activation","neutralizing titres","mouth disease virus","immune response","FMDV","opsonising antibody titres","immune protection","presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies","enhanced IFN-\u03B1 responses","antiviral responses","related viruses","distant viruses","viral isolates","acute disease of cloven-hoofed species","non-neutralized isolates of multiple serotypes","strain-specific differences","Toll","additional finding of potential importance","Picornaviridae","interferon","immunogenicity","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","virulence","macrophages","broader reactivity","infectious member","present study","important mechanism","production of type","receptor","Foot","sera cross","Vaccine","results","assay"],"language":"en"},

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16\u201328%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account.

The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. FINDINGS: Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29\u201334 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth. INTERPRETATION: The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied \u201CearlyR\u201D package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied \u201Cprojections\u201D package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06\u20132.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384\u20131656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981\u20131177) and 758 (697\u2013817), respectively. Conclusion The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06\u20132.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Sheng; Diao, MengYuan; Yu, Wenbo; Pei, Lei; Lin, Zhaofen; Chen, Dechang","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/349104eb16d3c08e212c6ee78230d8778621c40f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110591.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220300916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097725/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220300916","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["estimated R0","CI of R0","value of R0","change of R0","R0 values","future daily incidence","early stage of outbreak","early stage of COVID","estimated cumulative cases","daily infectiousness","prediction of daily new cases","estimated total number of cumulative cases","data of existing daily incidence","greater outbreak","probable number of new cases","potential of COVID","Diamond Princess cruise ship","serial interval distribution","probable outbreak size","Poisson distribution","reported serial interval","confidence interval","gamma distribution","reproductive number","package","median","plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories","strict infection management","bootstrap resampling method","standard deviation","novel virus","control","earlyR","assumption","model","crucial importance","findings","Maximum-Likelihood","Conclusion","projections","days","Abstract Backgrounds"],"language":"en"},

Modern plasma product production technology remains largely based on the ethanol fractionation process, but much has evolved in the last few years to improve product purity, to enhance the recovery of immunoglobulin G, and to isolate new plasma proteins, such as \u03B11-protease inhibitor, von Willebrand factor, and protein C. Because of the human origin of the starting material and the pooling of 10 000 to 50 000 donations required for industrial processing, the major risk associated to plasma products is the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents. A complete set of measures\u2014and, most particularly, the use of dedicated viral inactivation and removal treatments\u2014has been implemented throughout the production chain of fractionated plasma products over the last 20 years to ensure optimal safety, in particular, and not exclusively, against HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. In this review, we summarize the practices of the modern plasma fractionation industry from the collection of the raw plasma material to the industrial manufacture of fractionated products. We describe the quality requirements of plasma for fractionation and the various treatments applied for the inactivation and removal of blood-borne infectious agents and provide examples of methods used for the purification of the various classes of plasma protein therapies. We also highlight aspects of the good manufacturing practices and the regulatory environment that govern the whole chain of production. In a regulated and professional environment, fractionated plasma products manufactured by modern processes are certainly among the lowest-risk therapeutic biological products in use today.","publish_time":"2007-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burnouf, Thierry","journal":"Transfus Med Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d7814a6d867eeba90065eeb9e8bf94d54608873.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125842.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887796306000940; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887796306000940","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Willebrand"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human plasma","production chain of fractionated plasma products","Protein products","raw plasma material","modern plasma fractionation industry","new plasma proteins","quality requirements of plasma","Modern plasma product production technology","various classes of plasma protein therapies","industrial manufacture of fractionated products","chain of production","lowest-risk therapeutic biological products","removal treatments","removal of blood","modern processes","various treatments","infectious agents","years","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus","ethanol fractionation process","regulatory environment","major risk","professional environment","starting material","industrial processing","transmission of blood","use of dedicated viral inactivation","human origin","product purity","good manufacturing practices","trauma","collection","congenital deficiencies","treatment of life-threatening conditions","management","immunologic disorders","\u03B11-protease inhibitor","purification","Willebrand factor","prevention","examples of methods","recovery of immunoglobulin G","essential class of therapeutics","infections","optimal safety","pooling","donations","aspects","HIV","available option","complete set of measures","review"],"language":"en"},

While a cadre of willing and able health workers is essential for an effective epidemic response, health workforce capacity in times of crisis may be significantly impacted by how risks are perceived by health staff. This study aimed to explore how risk perceptions influenced healthcare workers\u2019 willingness to respond during this outbreak. METHODS: Through in-depth interviews with 11 front-line international health care workers who chose to respond to the West Africa outbreak, this qualitative study explores how perceptions of risk developed and subsequently mediated the decision to respond to the outbreak. Data was thematically organized using NVivo 10. RESULTS: We found that numerous individual and social-level factors played a role in modifying risk perception in health workers. Institutional trust emerged as a key risk attenuator, as did past experience, self-efficacy, duty of care, humanitarian ethos, and cognitive heuristics. Feelings of risk were amplified by infections of co-workers, and risk perceptions of family members and the public, which were mainly informed by media reports, also hampered willingness to respond in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the risk perceptions of health workers, institutions, and the public, while complex and interdependent, are each crucial to understand for an effective public health response to epidemics, and as such should be taken into consideration in future program planning and research.","publish_time":"2017-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gee, Stephanie; Skovdal, Morten","journal":"Glob Health Res Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eadeab29c774bb8b5935c5ce5d741855a8080a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5683558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-017-0042-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["risk perceptions of health workers","perceptions of risk","able health workers","health staff","effective public health response","Feelings of risk","unprecedented public health event","front-line international health care workers","health workforce capacity","risk perceptions of family members","key risk attenuator","West Africa outbreak","effective epidemic response","healthcare workers\u2019 willingness","duty of care","qualitative study","West Africa Ebola Virus Disease","EVD","past experience","role","humanitarian ethos","self-efficacy","in-depth interviews","social-level factors","numerous individual","infections of co-workers","institutions","times of crisis","cadre of willing","addition","epidemics","cognitive heuristics","Institutional trust","recent history","consideration","future program","research","deaths","lives","RESULTS","METHODS","media reports","risks","CONCLUSIONS","decision","Data","NVivo","cases","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

However, limited data exist on the risk factors for childhood asthma phenotypes. Objective We sought to identify risk factors at the first severe wheezing episode for current asthma 7 years later and separately for atopic and nonatopic asthma. Methods One hundred twenty-seven steroid-naive children with the first severe wheezing episode (90% hospitalized/10% emergency department treated) were followed for 7 years. The primary outcome was current asthma at age 8 years, which was also analyzed separately as atopic and nonatopic asthma. Risk factors, including sensitization, viral cause, and other main asthma risk factors, were analyzed. Results At study entry, median age was 11 months (interquartile range, 6-16 months); 17% were sensitized, and 98% were virus positive. Current asthma (n = 37) at 8 years was divided into atopic (n = 19) and nonatopic (n = 18) asthma. The risk factors for current atopic asthma at study entry were sensitization (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 12; P \u003C .001), eczema (adjusted OR, 4.8; P = .014), and wheezing with rhinovirus (adjusted OR, 5.0; P = .035). The risk factors for nonatopic asthma were the first severe respiratory syncytial virus/rhinovirus\u2013negative wheezing episode (adjusted OR, 8.0; P = .001), first wheezing episode at age less than 12 months (adjusted OR, 7.3; P = .007), and parental smoking (adjusted OR, 3.8; P = .028). Conclusions The data suggest diverse asthma phenotypes and mechanisms that can be predicted by using simple clinical markers at the time of the first severe wheezing episode. These findings are important for designing early intervention strategies for secondary prevention of asthma.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lukkarinen, Minna; Koistinen, Annamari; Turunen, Riitta; Lehtinen, Pasi; Vuorinen, Tytti; Jartti, Tuomas","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6850435a9712d187cf1ac512454d701ca83f070c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172285.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347734/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674917304748; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.12.991; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674917304748","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current asthma","nonatopic asthma","current atopic asthma","main asthma risk factors","childhood asthma phenotypes","diverse asthma phenotypes","secondary prevention of asthma","severe wheezing episode","Background Persistent childhood asthma","negative wheezing episode","years","months","adjusted odds ratio","study entry","sensitization","median age","severe respiratory syncytial virus","rhinovirus","limited data","virus positive","early intervention strategies","time","viral cause","interquartile range","steroid-naive children","Results","atopy","Conclusions","mechanisms","primary outcome","simple clinical markers","findings","Methods","Objective","parental smoking","emergency department","eczema"],"language":"en"},

Newer viruses are still being discovered and those that are already known are being incriminated in the aetiology of clinical conditions with hitherto unknown causes. Apart from frequently causing infections in the general community, many types of viruses are also significant nosocomial pathogens. While it is generally agreed that we underestimate the proportion of nosocomial infections that are viral, due to a lack of routine monitoring, viruses easily account for more than 30% of the cases of hospital-acquired infections in many paediatric settings. Indeed, the relative importance of viruses in this respect is increasing due to a number of societal and demographic changes as well as alterations in healthcare practices. Safe vaccines against many common nosocomial viral agents are currently unavailable while there is also a virtual lack of effective and affordable chemotherapy against them. There is, therefore, renewed emphasis on preventive strategies by better understanding of the relative importance of various vehicles in the nosocomial spread of viruses and by infection control using microbicides. This, in turn, has stimulated considerable interest in the development of formulations that are not only safer but which also have demonstrated activity against major types of nosocomial viral pathogens. Further, much work is now underway to design better methods to assess the virucidal activity of microbicides used to decontaminate hands, reusable medical devices and environmental surfaces in critical areas of healthcare settings. It is anticipated that these approaches will result in reducing the health and economic impact of nosocomial infections due to viruses.","publish_time":"2004-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sattar, S.

Notwithstanding the urgent requirement of blood, it is critical to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion because many individuals may be asymptomatic carriers and may donate blood. Several cases in which specific viral RNA could be detected in the serum from patients with COVID-19 have already been reported; these findings suggest that blood donation may be an unexplored route of transmission. However, the American Association of Blood Banks and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended any specific SARS-CoV-2-related actions to be taken at blood collection centres at this time.

As emergent viruses may cause episodic outbreaks of disease over time, human samples are limited. Systems biology and genetic technologies maximize opportunities for identifying critical host and viral genetic factors that regulate susceptibility and virus-induced disease severity. These approaches provide discovery platforms that highlight and allow targeted confirmation of critical targets for prophylactics and therapeutics, especially critical in an outbreak setting. Although poorly understood, it has long been recognized that host regulation of virus-associated disease severity is multigenic. The advent of systems genetic and biology resources provide new opportunities for deconvoluting the complex genetic interactions and expression networks that regulate pathogenic or protective host response patterns following virus infection. Using SARS-CoV as a model, dynamic transcriptional network changes and disease-associated phenotypes have been identified in different genetic backgrounds, leading to the promise of population-wide discovery of the underpinnings of Coronavirus pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Baric, Ralph S.; Ferris, Martin T.","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4f4c623670abff7abee11121ceff491188794c2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3e5b33d5ae55f78fe3250e734dd9a3fb24f3625e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/18a55754d05f19a2baf43a925f91096f6806b3ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4076299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2014.04.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625714000893; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625714000893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic technologies","critical host","associated disease severity","advent of systems genetic","virus-induced disease severity","complex genetic interactions","disease-associated phenotypes","viral genetic factors","host regulation of virus","different genetic backgrounds","pathogenic SARS-CoV","episodic outbreaks of disease","virus infection","Systems biology","MERS-CoV strains","new opportunities","protective host response patterns","biology resources","targeted confirmation of critical targets","large group of emergent human","wide discovery","discovery platforms","emergent viruses","human samples","deconvoluting","expression networks","susceptibility","dynamic transcriptional network changes","significant morbidity","model","prophylactics","animal pathogens","infected individuals","mortality","time","therapeutics","promise of population","underpinnings of Coronavirus pathogenesis","multigenic","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. Objectives We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. Study design During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. Results The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4\u201320.6). Interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-\u03B3-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased during the late course of disease. Initial IP-10 levels during hospital days 1\u20134 were the most significantly correlated with initial viral load (r = 0.88, P \u003C .01). Conclusion SFTS viremia persisted until weeks 2\u20133 and was highly correlated with initial plasma IP-10 levels. In addition, IFN-\u03B1, IL-10, and IP-10 were associated with the initial cytokine storm in SFTS.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Ji-Soo; Kim, Min-Chul; Kim, Ji Yeun; Jeon, Na-Young; Ryu, Byung-Han; Hong, Jeongmin; Kim, Min-Jae; Chong, Yong Pil; Lee, Sang-Oh; Choi, Sang-Ho; Kim, Yang Soo; Woo, Jun Hee; Kim, Sung-Han","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d7899c1294d928e2db603c2aeb771340f7151b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.01.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427908/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218300301; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218300301","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFTS","RNA"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["SFTS patients","initial viral load","Initial IP","pathophysiology of SFTS","IL-12p40","initial plasma IP","initial cytokine storm","Conclusion SFTS viremia","IFN-\u03B1","negative conversion of SFTS viremia","late course of disease","early course of disease","cytokine profiles","hospital days","median duration of viral shedding","high fever","cytokines","admission period of patients","emerging infectious disease","IFN-\u03B3","cytokine bead arrays","levels","addition","concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","thrombocytopenia syndrome","median time","high mortality","Abstract Background Severe fever","vascular endothelial growth factor","VEGF","RANTES","China","Japan","important role","discharge","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","induced protein","patterns of changes","RNA","detailed kinetics","T-cell","Study design","Korea","weeks","interleukin","Activation","Objectives","chemokines","testing","Interferon","limited data","CI"],"language":"en"},

In this report we determined if Advax displays broad applicability against important human pathogens by assessing protective immunity against infection with M. tuberculosis. The fusion protein CysVac2, comprising the M. tuberculosis antigens Ag85B (Rv1886c) and CysD (Rv1285) formulated with Advax provided significant protection in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Protection was associated with the generation of CysVac2-specific multifunctional CD4(\u002B) T cells (IFN-\u03B3(\u002B)TNF(\u002B)IL-2(\u002B)). Addition to Advax of the TLR9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotide (Advax(CpG)), improved both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CysVac2. Immunisation with CysVac2/Advax(CpG) resulted in heightened release of the chemoattractants, CXCL1, CCL3, and TNF, and rapid influx of monocytes and neutrophils to the site of vaccination, with pronounced early priming of CysVac2-specific CD4(\u002B) T cells.

However, the detailed mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with HCV is not yet completely understood. We previously identified a novel C-type lectin\u2014LSECtin predominantly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment.

The second of this three part review series considers the management of diarrhoeic diseases in pre-weaned calves. In neonatal calf diarrhoea, oral rehydration therapy is the single most important therapeutic measure to be carried out by the farmer and is usually successful if instigated immediately after diarrhoea has developed. Continued feeding of milk or milk replacer to diarrhoeic calves is important, to prevent malnourishment and weight loss in affected calves. Indiscriminative antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea is discouraged, whereas systemically ill calves can benefit from systemic antibiotic treatment for the prevention of septicaemia or concurrent diseases. Ancillary treatments and specific preventive measures are discussed. Eimeriosis has a high economic impact on the farming industries due to direct cost of treatment and calf losses, but especially due to decreased performance of clinically as well as sub-clinically affected animals. Emphasis lies on prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment, since the degree of damage to the intestinal mucosa once diarrhoea has developed, makes therapeutic intervention unrewarding.","publish_time":"2011-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorenz, Ingrid; Fagan, John; More, Simon J","journal":"Ir Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5dc4bad737644cb25aeb8e23ba999402b0df872.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3182126.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-0481-64-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21917151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eimeriosis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrhoeic calves","affected calves","metaphylactic treatment","ill calves","Indiscriminative antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea","systemic antibiotic treatment","neonatal calf diarrhoea","direct cost of treatment","management of diarrhoeic diseases","pre-weaned calves","concurrent diseases","Calfhood diseases","high economic impact","important therapeutic measure","major impact","calf losses","milk replacer","therapeutic intervention unrewarding","economic viability of cattle operations","oral rehydration therapy","farming industries","malnourishment","prevention of septicaemia","degree of damage","weight loss","Ancillary treatments","specific preventive measures","intestinal mucosa","review series","Emphasis","prophylactic","Eimeriosis","decreased performance","animals","farmer"],"language":"en"},

Up to the 1(st) October 2015 it has infected at least 1593 people with a global fatality rate of about 35%. Studies to understand the virus are necessary and urgent. In the present study, MERS-CoV main protease (M(pro)) is expressed; the dimerization of the protein and its relationship to catalysis are investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crystal structure of MERS-CoV M(pro) indicates that it shares a similar scaffold to that of other coronaviral M(pro) and consists of chymotrypsin-like domains I and II and a helical domain III of five helices. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis demonstrated that MERS-CoV M(pro) undergoes a monomer to dimer conversion in the presence of a peptide substrate. Glu169 is a key residue and plays a dual role in both dimerization and catalysis. The mutagenesis of other residues found on the dimerization interface indicate that dimerization of MERS-CoV M(pro) is required for its catalytic activity. One mutation, M298R, resulted in a stable dimer with a higher level of proteolytic activity than the wild-type enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV M(pro) shows substrate-induced dimerization and potent proteolytic activity. A critical assessment of the residues important to these processes provides insights into the correlation between dimerization and catalysis within the coronaviral M(pro) family.","publish_time":"2015-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Bo-Lin; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Shi, Lin; Wang, Ting-Yun; Ho, Kuan-I; Chou, Chi-Yuan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff986fb85af07d524411d6eb829e38be349df839.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4682845.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Jeddah","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["dimerization of MERS","MERS-CoV main protease","dimerization interface","substrate-induced dimerization","catalysis","crystal structure of MERS","potent proteolytic activity","coronaviral","catalytic activity","higher level of proteolytic activity","residues important","dimer conversion","stable dimer","peptide substrate","pathogenic human coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","presence","insights","dual role","present study","key residue","processes","wild-type enzyme","RESULTS","Jeddah","monomer","correlation","Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis","global fatality rate","people","places","Saudi Arabia","METHODS","M298R","critical assessment","BACKGROUND","protein","relationship","helical domain","Asian countries","helices","domains","Studies","Glu169","similar scaffold","chymotrypsin","family","CONCLUSIONS","mutation","mutagenesis"],"language":"en"},

The etiology of anemia predominates from ineffective erythropoiesis from marrow infiltration, cytokine related suppression, erythropoietin suppression, and vitamin deficiency; ineffective erythropoiesis is further exacerbated by accelerated clearance due to antibody mediated hemolysis and thrombotic microangiopathy. As the anemia is chronic in nature, symptoms are generally well tolerated and often non-specific. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a balance between providing benefit for patients while avoiding risks of transfusion. Conservative/restrictive RBC transfusion practices have shown equivalent patient outcomes compared to liberal transfusion practices, and meta-analysis has shown improved in-hospital mortality, reduced cardiac events, re-bleeding, and bacterial infections. The implications for a lower threshold for transfusion in patients with malignancies are therefore increasingly being scrutinized. Alternative management strategies for anemia with IV iron and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) should be considered in the appropriate settings.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Neil; Andrews, Jennifer; Goodnough, Lawrence Tim","journal":"Blood Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4427dd14e1d222e045f32526c286bf31ad29653f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127235.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268960X15000168; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268960X15000168; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.blre.2015.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25796130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risks of transfusion","liberal transfusion practices","etiology of anemia","Abstract Anemia","restrictive RBC transfusion practices","erythropoietin suppression","ineffective erythropoiesis","Transfusion of red blood cells","thirds of patients","cytokine related suppression","equivalent patient outcomes","marrow infiltration","antibody mediated hemolysis","iron","re-bleeding","cardiac events","accelerated clearance","meta-analysis","vitamin deficiency","hospital mortality","RBCs","lower threshold","thrombotic microangiopathy","malignant hematological disorders","balance","Conservative","Alternative management strategies","bacterial infections","agents","ESAs","benefit","nature","symptoms","implications","malignancies"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen with a 100 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen in patients with acute PTE. Methods A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted in which 118 patients with acute PTE and either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction were randomly assigned to receive a treatment regiment of either rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h (n = 65) or 100 mg/2 h (n = 53). The efficacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular dysfunctions (RVDs) on echocardiograms, lung perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. Results Progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions were found to be similarly significant in both treatment groups. This is true for patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Three (6%) patients in the rt-PA 100 mg/2 h group and one (2%) in the rt-PA 50 mg/2 h group died as the result of either PTE or bleeding. Importantly, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen resulted in less bleeding tendency than the 100 mg/2 h regimen (3% vs 10%), especially in patients with a body weight \u003C 65 kg (14.8% vs 41.2%, P = .049). No fatal recurrent PTE was found in either group. Conclusions Compared with the 100 mg/2 h regimen, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen exhibits similar efficacy and perhaps better safety in patients with acute PTE. These findings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is worthwhile when treating patients with PTE.

Since it was first identified in a patient who died in a Jeddah hospital in 2012, the World Health Organization has been notified of 1735 laboratory-confirmed cases from 27 countries, including 628 deaths. Most cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoVancestors may be found in OldWorld bats of the Vespertilionidae family. After a proposed bat to camel switching event, transmission of MERS-CoV to humans is likely to have been the result of multiple zoonotic transfers from dromedary camels. Human-to-human transmission appears to require close contact with infected persons, with outbreaks mainly occurring in hospital environments. Outbreaks have been associated with inadequate infection prevention and control implementation, resulting in recommendations on basic and more advanced infection prevention and control measures by the World Health Organization, and issuing of government guidelines based on these recommendations in affected countries including Saudi Arabia. Evolutionary changes in the virus, particularly in the viral spike protein which mediates virus-host cell contact may potentially increase transmission of this virus. Efforts are on-going to identify specific evidence-based therapies or vaccines. The broad-spectrum antiviral nitazoxanide has been shown to have in vitro activity against MERS-CoV. Synthetic peptides and candidate vaccines based on regions of the spike protein have shown promise in rodent and non-human primate models.

To date, over 60 types of HAdV have been identified. Here, HAdV types are characterized in children in the Beijing area with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) and the clinical features and laboratory findings of hospitalized HAdV-infected cases are described. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were collected from pediatric patients with ALRTIs in the emergency department or from those admitted to Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital between March 2007 and December 2012. Infections with common respiratory viruses were determined by PCR or RT-PCR. HAdV positive samples were further typed by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Among 3356 patients with ALRTIs, 194 (5.8 %) were found to have HAdV infection. HAdV infection was primarily confined to children (88.35 %) less than 5 years of age. A total of 11 different types of HAdV were detected throughout the study period, with HAdV-B7 (49.0 %) and HAdV-B3 (26.3 %) as the most prevalent types, followed by HAdV-C2 (7.7 %) and HAdVC1 (4.6 %). Newly emerging and re-emergent types or variants, HAdV-B55 (n = 5), HAdV-C57 (n = 3), and HAdV-B14p1 (n = 1), were identified. Results also included the reported first case of co-infection with HAdV-C2 and HAdV-C57. Clinical entities of patients with single HAdV infection (n = 49) were similar to those with mixed HAdV/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections (n = 41). Patients with HAdV-B7 infection had longer duration of fever and higher serum levels of muscle enzymes than HAdV-B3-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B3 were the predominant types identified in pediatric ALRTIs. HAdV-B7 infection tends to have more severe clinical consequences. The presence of newly emerging types or variants and co-infection with different types of HAdV highlights the need for constant and close surveillance of HAdV infection.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chunyan; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Jing; Ren, Lili; Li, Jianguo; Xie, Zhengde; Xu, Baoping; Yang, Yan; Qian, Suyun; Wang, Jianwei; Shen, Kunling","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3868e20a756883f97b18c851e9e6df7ad0cb11e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4591558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1126-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26429778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["HAdV types","HAdV-B3","HAdV-C2","HAdV-C57","mixed HAdV","HAdV-B55","HAdV-B14p1","HAdV-B7 infection","different types of HAdV","single HAdV infection","HAdV positive samples","close surveillance of HAdV infection","laboratory findings of hospitalized HAdV-infected cases","emerging types","predominant types","prevalent types","pediatric patients","case of co-infection","pediatric respiratory tract infections","pediatric ALRTIs","infected patients","re-emergent types","Respiratory specimens","Clinical entities of patients","acute lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus","common respiratory viruses","variants","clinical features","study period","RT-PCR","RESULTS","severe clinical consequences","Beijing area","Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital","duration of fever","higher serum levels of muscle enzymes","significant role","need","RSV","emergency department","Human adenoviruses","BACKGROUND","presence","total","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","date","years of age","HAdVC1","sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Various cities have already started development and implementation of such Integrated Urban Services and successfully test and use them following specific requirements of local stakeholders. This paper demonstrates the novel concept and approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services (IUS) from a set of four case study cities: Hong Kong, Toronto, Mexico City and Paris, that use different IUS configurations with good existing practice. These cities represent a range of countries, climates and geophysical settings. The aggregate main joint similarities of the IUS in these cities and synergy of the cities\u0027 experience, achievements and research findings are presented, as well as identification of existing gaps in knowledge and further research needs. A list of potential criteria for identifying and classifying IUS demonstration cities is proposed. It will aid future, more detailed analysis of the IUS experience, and selection of additional demonstration cities.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baklanov, Alexander; C\u00E1rdenas, Beatriz; Lee, Tsz-cheung; Leroyer, Sylvie; Masson, Valery; Molina, Luisa T.; M\u00FCller, Tanya; Ren, Chao; Vogel, Felix R.; Voogt, James A.","journal":"Urban Climate","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5476cdca4c00a82a807ed5b7f60d0d920906901b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118613.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100610; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212095519300537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289009/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095519300537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Climate and Environmental Services","World Meteorological Organization","Integrated Urban Services"],"locations":["Toronto","Mexico City"],"keyphrases":["integrated urban services","IUS demonstration cities","resilient cities","Various cities","IUS experience","Environmental Services","new types of urban services","approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological","case study cities","selection of additional demonstration cities","different IUS configurations","climate change","best use of science","World Meteorological Organization","new initiative","cities\u0027 experience","research findings","research needs","good existing practice","identification of existing gaps","Hong Kong","Toronto","Paris","Mexico City","novel concept","knowledge","achievements","synergy","systems","development","implementation","range of countries","Abstract Rapid urbanization","aggregate main joint similarities","climates","WMO","detailed analysis","geophysical settings","specific requirements of local stakeholders","paper","list of potential criteria","technology","future"],"language":"en"},

Because viruses can evolve faster than their hosts, the innate immune system of modern-day vertebrates is for the most part optimized to defend against ancient viruses, rather than newer viral threats.

Adenovirus (Ad) has long been the predominant cause of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in military trainees. In 2011, live oral Ad vaccines for serotypes 4 and 7 were reintroduced into US basic military training populations. This study evaluated the impact on clinical presentations and other respiratory pathogens. Methods. The Center for Advanced Molecular Detection at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland prospectively collects demographic, clinical, and polymerase chain reaction data from respiratory specimens (throat swab and nasal wash) among Air Force trainees presenting for care of ARI. Results. From June 2008 to August 2013, 2660 trainees enrolled and were tested for selected respiratory pathogens. Post-vaccine introduction (VI), reported systemic symptoms were less frequent, including fever (38% vs 94%) and myalgia (37% vs 67%; P \u003C .01). Median temperature and heart rate decreased (98.4 vs 101.3\u00B0F, 81 vs 96 beats per minute; P \u003C .01). Ad detection decreased for all Ad (3% vs 68%), Ad4 (1% vs 70%), 7 (0% vs 8%), 14 (0% vs 5%), and 3 (0.1% vs 2%); P \u003C .01). Rhinovirus and cases with no pathogen identified increased in frequency (35% vs 18%, 51% vs 14%; P \u003C .01). Conclusions. Acute respiratory illness in military trainees post-VI is associated with decreased severity of systemic symptoms and reduced fever and heart rate. Marked reductions in frequency of Ad serotypes are seen, including those in the vaccine, with no serotype shift. However, detection of several other respiratory pathogens, most notably rhinovirus, is observed in increasing proportions, and a majority are now undiagnosed clinical syndromes.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yun, Heather C.; Young, Adam N.; Caballero, Manuel Y.; Lott, Lisa; Cropper, Thomas L.; Murray, Clinton K.","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1ed23f642ae10aad709176ea8025687b34d5c27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4569648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26380351/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofv120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Air Force"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vs","Ad detection","respiratory specimens","selected respiratory pathogens","frequency of Ad serotypes","military trainees post-VI","predominant cause of acute respiratory illness","Air Force trainees","clinical presentations","heart rate","decreased severity of systemic symptoms","live oral Ad vaccines","Rhinovirus","Advanced Molecular Detection","undiagnosed clinical syndromes","Post-vaccine introduction","reduced fever","care of ARI","US basic military training populations","nasal wash","Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland","polymerase chain reaction data","throat swab","demographic","majority","Center","impact","beats","increasing proportions","cases","study","Median temperature","reductions","minute","serotype shift","myalgia","Ad4","Adenovirus","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u201Csilently\u201D spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics.

We examined several MASP2 functional polymorphisms in 104 Brazilian patients with moderate and severe chronic hepatitis C using the primers set to amplify the region encoding the first domain (CUB1), a critical region for the formation of functional mannan-binding lectin (MBL)/MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP)\u20132 complexes, and the fifth domain (CCP2), which is essential for C4 cleavage of the MASP2 gene. We identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms in patients and controls: p. R99Q, p. D120G, p.P126L, p.D371Y, and p.V377A. Our results show that the p.D371Y variant (c.1111 G \u003E T) is associated with susceptibility to HCV infection (p = 0.003, odds ratio = 6.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.85\u201321.70).

The WHO was notified of 27 countries have reported cases of MERS, the majority of these cases occur in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Dromedary camels are likely to be the main source of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans. METHODS: MERS-CoV infection rates among camels in livestock markets and slaughterhouses were investigated in Saudi Arabia. A total of 698 nasal swabs were collected and examined with Rapid assay and rtRT-PCR. Ten MERS-CoV positive samples were subjected to full genomic sequencing. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the Rapid immunochromatographic assay (BioNote, South Korea) was evaluated as a diagnostic tool for MERS-CoV compared to rtRT-PCR. RESULTS: The results showed a high percentage of dromedaries (56.4%) had evidence for nasal MERS-CoV infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the ten MERS-CoV isolates showed that the sequences were closely related to the other MERS-CoV strains recovered from camels and human cases. Moreover, the results showed that 195 samples were positive for MERS-CoV by rapid assay compared to 394 positive samples of rtRT-PCR, which showed low rapid assay sensitivity (49.49%) while, the specificity were found to be 100%.

Co-infection was frequently found in HBoV-positive patients. Thus, whether HBoV is responsible for the respiratory disease is still arguable. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive study was carried out to integrate clinical and virological prevalence in HBoV-positive outpatient children, and to determine genetic and serologic characteristics of HBoV in Shanghai, China. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal/throat swabs and sera were obtained over a 2-year period from 817 children with respiratory tract infection to examine the presence of HBoV and its co-infection. The seroepidemiology of HBoV was studied by ELISA and Western blot against the capsid protein VP2-based fragment. Persistence of HBoV was also analyzed in 12 pairs of return-visit cases. RESULTS: HBoV was identified in 96 samples (11.8%). The co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 51%. IgM was detected in 55.7% of HBoV RT-PCR-positive patients, and in 72.7% of those who had high viral genome load. In addition, persistent viral DNA positivity was detected in 10 of 12 HBoV-positive cases tested, an average of 14 days later, and one child was still HBoV-positive after 31 days. CONCLUSION: HBoV was found frequently in children with respiratory tract symptoms associated with other respiratory viruses, and persisted in the respiratory tract and in serum and urine. The presence of IgM was significantly more prevalent in viremic patients and those diagnosed with high load of HBoV DNA in nasal/throat swabs.","publish_time":"2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Kai; Wang, Wei; Yan, Huajie; Ren, Peijun; Zhang, Jing; Shen, Jun; Deubel, Vincent","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3248603667ebc528d651336bff45e0b4cd208ae2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172221.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209005563; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.11.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209005563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022295/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["presence of HBoV","seroepidemiology of HBoV","Persistence of HBoV","HBoV-positive patients","HBoV-positive cases","HBoV-positive outpatient children","respiratory tract infection","serologic characteristics of HBoV","HBoV RT-PCR","high load of HBoV DNA","respiratory viruses","respiratory tract symptoms","respiratory disease","co-infection rate","Nasal","throat swabs","viremic patients","presence of IgM","days","high viral genome load","persistent viral DNA positivity","STUDY DESIGN","comprehensive study","Western blot","capsid protein VP2-based fragment","virological prevalence","ELISA","addition","Shanghai","discovered virus","year period","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","China","sera","average","serum","urine","world","pairs of return","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","samples","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly. Aim To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance. Methods A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types. Results 50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks. Conclusions The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Event-based Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Shea, Jesse","journal":"International Journal of Medical Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cec3c1a47e3174f7540ad9285b61ab28addb415d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108385.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505617300308; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505617300308; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.01.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347443/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["event-based Internet systems","Internet-based surveillance systems","event-based Internet biosurveillance systems","Internet sources","extension of traditional systems","data sources","disease surveillance","limitations of traditional reporting systems","accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance","Abstract Background Internet access","vast digital data","supplemental data source","analysis of Big Data","comprehensive programmes of surveillance","new surveillance type","infectious disease outbreaks","informal sources","comprehensive estimate of disease burden","new methods","infectious diseases","epidemic intelligence","systematic review","current functionality","report health information","hopes of learning","current state of knowledge","opportunity","different innovative technology","PubMed","Scopus","people","usage","social media","Google Scholar databases","events","grey literature","importance","decision makers","components","indicator","building","process","Results","publication types","news aggregates","extraction","library","future researchers","attributes","humanity","Conclusions","innovations","articles"],"language":"en"},

A sensible working diagnosis can usually be formulated from a careful history and examination and initial simple investigations. The history should include details of exactly where the patient has been, what conditions he or she was living in, and the exact dates of arrival and departure. The quality of pre-travel advice and vaccinations, adherence to chemoprophylaxis against malaria, avoidance of insect bites and general behaviour abroad (including sexual history) are also important. Localizing features of the illness should be sought on examination. Maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying HIV. The most important illness to consider and exclude is malaria (about 40% of cases), and most of the remainder have cosmopolitan viral infections or imported infections such as an arbovirus (dengue), enteric fever or viral hepatitis. Rarer causes are usually evident from the history and examination, which presupposes a good knowledge of geographical medicine. Initial investigations should include adequate malaria films (supplemented by quick antigen detection tests in many laboratories) and blood count, repeated as necessary, blood, urine and faecal cultures, serum biochemistry, chest radiography and other imaging (e.g. liver ultrasonography) as indicated. In patients in whom malaria is suspected despite negative films, the combination of thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly is supportive but not diagnostic of malaria.","publish_time":"2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beeching, Nick","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff8b57e1d85ad83a71c0a4b74b9802e45911b0b1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308535/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906002222; https://doi.org/10.1383/medc.2005.33.7.3; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357303906002222","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic of malaria","examination","adequate malaria films","sexual history","careful history","important illness","tropical illness","Initial investigations","initial simple investigations","cosmopolitan viral infections","negative films","enteric fever","blood count","Abstract Fever","viral hepatitis","acute hospital admission","faecal cultures","vaccinations","adherence","serum biochemistry","common reason","chest radiography","laboratories","urine","general behaviour","avoidance of insect bites","chemoprophylaxis","quick antigen detection tests","imaging","quality of pre-travel advice","combination of thrombocytopenia","UK referral units","dengue","high index of suspicion","underlying HIV","splenomegaly","arbovirus","good knowledge of geographical medicine","exact dates of arrival","departure","remainder","liver ultrasonography","Rarer causes","sensible working diagnosis","Localizing features","details","conditions","cases","patients"],"language":"en"},

Fourteen adult cats were evaluated \u2014 seven without clinical signs of osteoarthritic pain, and seven with hind limb radiographic DJD and pain. Expression of an investigator-selected set of pain signaling genes (including ASIC3, ATF3, COX2, CX3CL1, NAV1.7, NAV1.8, NAV1.9, NGF, NK1R, TNF\u03B1, TRKA) in lumbar spinal cord dorsal horn and lumbar dorsal root ganglia tissues from clinically healthy cats and cats with DJD were studied using quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). HKG identified as the most stable across all tissue samples were many of the ribosomal protein genes, such as RPL30 and RPS19. qPCR results showed ATF3 and CX3CL1 up-regulated in DJD-affected dorsal root ganglia compared to clinically healthy controls. In spinal cord, CX3CL1 was up-regulated and NGF was down-regulated when DJD-affected samples were compared to healthy samples.

Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible \u201Ctrypsin-like\u201D cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo.

Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults is one of the most common infectious diseases seen in general practitioners\u2019 consultations. Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection.

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD \u00B1 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Lei; Mu, Mi; Yang, Pengcheng; Sun, Yu; Wang, Runsheng; Yan, Junhong; Li, Pibao; Hu, Baoguang; Wang, Jing; Hu, Chao; Jin, Yuan; Niu, Xun; Ping, Rongyu; Du, Yingzhen; Li, Tianzhi; Xu, Guogang; Hu, Qinyong; Tu, Lei","journal":"Am J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/361f6760a7ead6ef0575840b2e388a17df082070.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287140/; https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various digestive symptoms","confirmed patients","respiratory symptoms","at-risk patients","longer time","outcomes of COVID","total cases","diarrhea","presenting features of COVID","longer prothrombin time","laboratory data","higher liver enzyme levels","evidence of longer coagulation","admission","onset","multicenter study","present study","gastrointestinal-specific symptom","historical data","lack of appetite","abdominal pain","higher mean liver enzyme levels","antimicrobial treatment","days vs","gastrointestinal tract","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","lower monocyte count","clinical characteristics","real-time polymerase chain reaction","fever","average age","years","SD","imaging","large sample studies","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","analysis","prevalence","severity","DISCUSSION","Clinicians","index of suspicion","women","findings","hospitals"],"language":"en"},

We generated specific antibodies against SARS protein 3a by using a synthetic peptide (P2) corresponding to amino acids 261\u2013274 of the putative protein. Anti-P2 antibodies and the sera from SARS patients could specifically detect the recombinant SARS protein 3a expressed in Escherichia coli and in Vero E6 cells. Expression of SARS protein 3a was detected at 8\u201312 h after infection and reached a higher level after \u223C24 h in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Protein 3a was also detected in the alveolar lining pneumocytes and some intra-alveolar cells of a SARS-CoV-infected patient\u0027s lung specimen.

Nucleoprotein (N) sequences of the virus at passages 155 and 165 were aligned and compared using a computer software program. The suitability of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for differentiation of the vaccine strain from the other TGEVs was investigated. The RFLP analysis identified a change in the cleavage sites of AclI at passages 155 and 165. This RFLP pattern of the N gene differentiated the Chinese vaccine strain from its parental strain, the 11 TGEVs studied and the other reported TGEVs in the GenBank. Using phylogenetic analysis, the Chinese TGEVs were divided into three groups (G1, G2, and G3). The G3 Chinese TGEVs possessed several specific nucleotides and amino acids that were not found in the G1 and G2 Chinese TGEVs or the other reference TGEVs. Analysis of the phylogenetic trees revealed that the G3 TGEVs represent a separate group that is distinct from the non-Chinese TGEVs and from Chinese TGEVs isolated previously. These findings suggest that Chinese strains of TGEV are evolving continuously.","publish_time":"2010-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chengbao; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Qiu, Hua-Ji; Xue, Fei; Liu, Shengwang; Liu, Changming; Zhu, Yuanmao; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis; Feng, Li","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20414714/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-010-0481-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFLP","G1"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["G3 Chinese TGEVs","G3 TGEVs","G2 Chinese TGEVs","non-Chinese TGEVs","reference TGEVs","reported TGEVs","Chinese vaccine strain","Chinese strains of TGEV","RFLP analysis","phylogenetic analysis","passages","parental strain","strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","RFLP pattern","Vaccines","G1","N gene","phylogenetic trees","specific nucleotides","suitability of restriction fragment length polymorphism","prevention","change","differentiation","control of infections","designated H16","separate group","cleavage sites of AclI","cell cultures","sequences","groups","amino acids","PK","China","findings","computer software program","cells","Nucleoprotein","GenBank","level"],"language":"en"},

Being unfamiliar with medical ethics and legal aspects of care, and suboptimal virtues among physicians, have led to patients and the public utilizing legal remedies. In addition, sophistication of medical practice, increasing costs of health care, involvement of insurance systems, increased awareness and high expectations from the community and patients, and increased participation of the media have altered the attitude toward claiming compensation and acquisition of health care delivery among the public. In view of the changing trends of consumers and emerging areas in health care, providers must get accustomed to patient empowerment and come up to their expectations. Interactive programs on these aspects in medical education will help students understand not only the intricacies of medical ethics and the laws and shortcomings of health professionals and/or health systems, but also strengthen their knowledge of ethics and laws to improve their practice. Principles of ethics and legal issues have to be discussed at every stage of medical education.

It was first isolated in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and after that, MERS-CoV exhibited outbreaks in several regions of the world. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of publications involving MERS-CoV at global level by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Scopus database was searched on March 4, 2016 for MERS-CoV publications published between 2012 and 2015. It was performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metrics are changing over time. All publication types were considered; however publications as errata were excluded. Analysis parameters include year of publication, publication type, patterns of international collaboration, research institutions, journals, impact factor, h-index, language, and times cited. RESULTS: A total of 883 MERS-CoV research publications were published across the world. The MERS-CoV-associated publications were originated from 92 countries/territories, indicating the international spread of MERS-CoV research. The USA was the largest contributor, with 319 articles published over 4 years, followed by KSA (113 articles). The total number of citations for these publications has already achieved 8,015, with an average of 9.01 citations per each publication. The h-index for MERS-CoV-associated publications was 48. The USA also have the highest h-index (32), followed by KSA (26) and UK (22). Netherland produced the greatest proportion of publications with international research collaboration (72.7 %) followed by the UK (71 %) and Germany (69.1 %) out of the total number of publications for each country. CONCLUSIONS: There is a rapid increase in research activities related to MERS-CoV from 2012 to 2015. This study demonstrates that the MERS-CoV related literature has grown to be more extensive and global over the past 4 years. The bulk of publications in the field of MERS-CoV research are published by high-income countries such as the USA. Furthermore, the USA, the UK and KSA may have higher quality of articles according to the value of h-index.","publish_time":"2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a679e9fdf3590b7f9204c3dc3ff6307c3d4642b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4897912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27267256/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1600-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","UK","Netherland"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV publications","MERS-CoV research publications","MERS-CoV related literature","field of MERS","associated publications","characteristics of publications","bulk of publications","international spread of MERS","total number of publications","greatest proportion of publications","KSA","USA","international research collaboration","research institutions","research activities","highest h-index","UK","year of publication","publication types","value of h","total number of citations","patterns of international collaboration","years","world","study","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","higher quality of articles","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","global level","high-income countries","Analysis parameters","bibliometric analysis","Scopus database","severe viral pneumonia","clinical symptoms","similarity","journals","impact factor","BACKGROUND","high mortality rate","rapid increase","possible bias","update","humans","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","language","outbreaks","order","metrics","territories","Netherland","largest contributor","regions","country","day","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","times","average","RESULTS","Germany","errata"],"language":"en"},

Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. METHODS: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. RESULTS: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.","publish_time":"2019-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Dan; Lou, Xiuyu; Yan, Hao; Pan, Junhang; Mao, Haiyan; Tang, Hongfeng; Shu, Yan; Zhao, Yun; Liu, Lei; Li, Junping; Chen, Dong; Zhang, Yanjun; Ma, Xuejun","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f849d3e71f4d2eae8a1e39802195bc9c06fc30ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6580463.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1086-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208426/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSP","RSV","VRI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic PSPs","mild symptomatic PSPs","Viral respiratory infection","mild symptoms","respiratory symptom","asymptomatic PSP group","post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group","positive PSPs","quantitative viral load","respiratory syncytial virus","elective surgery","higher viral load","pediatric surgery patients","different respiratory virus infections","preoperative testing of respiratory viruses","Asymptomatic shedding","viral quantity","detected viruses","PIV3 infection","cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases","progression of symptomatic diseases","qRT-PCR","quantitative method","VRI","incidence of infection","HKU1","parainfluenza virus","children","OC43","study","HRV","detected pathogens","surgical procedure","symptom data","CoV NL63","optimal surgical timing","quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","order","enterovirus","association","human rhino","new risk factor","pneumonia","common contraindication","induced sputum","coronavirus","years of age","total","BACKGROUND","assay panel","radiographic evidence","interstitial infiltration","RSV","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Key points \u2022 Mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract represent a major portal of entry for most human viruses and a critical component of the mammalian immunologic repertoire. The major antibody isotype in external secretions is secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA). The major effector cells in mucosal surfaces, however, are not IgA B cells, but T lymphocytes, which may account for up to 80% of the mucosal lymphoid cell population. \u2022 Mucosal immunoprophylaxis is theoretically an important approach to control infections acquired through these portals. Passive antibodies can protect against mucosal viral infections, as shown for respiratory syncytial virus, but very high quantities of passive antibodies are needed to restrict virus replication on mucosal surface. \u2022 Factors likely to induce mucosal antibody and cell-mediated immune responses include oral or respiratory routes of immunization and active (effectively replicating) vaccine agents. \u2022 Very few antiviral vaccines have been developed to protect the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract, and only an attenuated influenza virus vaccine uses the nasal route. Other vaccines, approved for parenteral use, have been administered experimentally by the nasal route; these include active (replicating) and inactive (nonreplicating) vaccines. By this route they induce only a moderate local mucosal response. \u2022 Neither the development of mucosal immunity nor the administration of vaccines via the mucosal route is essential for control or prevention of most respiratory viral infections and diseases acquired through the respiratory tract. Nonetheless, the example of the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine, which induces both systemic and local immune response, is promising for the future of mucosal immunization against respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Denis, F.; Alain, S.; Hantz, S.; Lagrange, P.","journal":"La Presse M\u00E9dicale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04ae258dc2d337cf80a7cede2a0f2c2bff9c4710.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075549820584165X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S075549820584165X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["IgA"],"keyphrases":["the future","the example","voie muqueuse","the mucosal route is essential","the nasal route","voie nasale","the respiratory tract represent","the mucosal lymphoid cell population","developed to protect the mucosal surface","mucosal immunity nor the administration","Neither the development","voie orale","voie parent\u00E9rale","voie inhabituelle","voie essentielle","The major effector cells in mucosal surfaces","mucosal immunization against respiratory viral infections","respiratory syncytial virus","diseases acquired through the respiratory tract","the mammalian immunologic repertoire","most respiratory viral infections","virus respiratoires","r\u00E9ponse immune muqueuse","moderate local mucosal response","the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine","respiratory routes","virus respiratoire syncytial","virus r\u00E9plicatifs","Factors likely to induce mucosal antibody","Passive antibodies can protect against mucosal viral infections","infections acquises","infections virales","niveau de la muqueuse","The major antibody isotype in external secretions is secretory immunoglobin","Mucosal immunoprophylaxis is theoretically an important approach to control infections acquired through these portals","only an attenuated influenza virus vaccine","needed to restrict virus replication","isotype IgA","local immune response","is promising","antiviral vaccines","Other vaccines","exemple du vaccin grippe","cellules IgA de type","major portal","these include active","this route they induce only","vaccine agents","surfaces muqueuses","vaccin grippal","vaccin actif","arbre respiratoire","lymphocytes","vaccins commercialis\u00E9s","vaccins vivants","mediated immune responses include oral","control or prevention","r\u00E9ponse locale mod\u00E9r\u00E9e","vaccins antiviraux muqueux","but very high quantities","effectively replicating","seul exemple","Key points","anticorps n\u00E9cessaires","grippe injectable","Points essentiels","cellules effectrices","most human viruses","which may account","principaux anticorps s\u00E9cr\u00E9t\u00E9s","which induces both systemic","as shown","critical component","entry","however","entr\u00E9e","rougeole","quantit\u00E9s","administered experimentally","approche int\u00E9ressante","parenteral","site critique","appar","immunit\u00E9","m\u00E9diation cellulaire","avenir de la vaccination","varicelle","porte","Nonetheless","facteurs susceptibles","immunoglobulines sp\u00E9cifiques administr\u00E9es","approved","totalit\u00E9 des populations lymphocytaires","nonreplicating","immunoprophylaxie"],"language":"fr"},

But is diabetes per se a risk factor that increases the probability of getting the virus? This paper will discuss this point. There are not many research data on antidiabetic drugs in this context. The potential influence of glucose-lowering agents on the severity of COVID-19 has not been described yet. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and it is also a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. This paper reviews data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and others diabetes drugs on COVID-19 patients. As such, no available evidence has yet suggested that glucose-lowering drugs \u2013 including those targeting DPP4-related pathways \u2013 produce any significant harm or benefit in the context of human infections. However, insulin must remain the first-choice agent in the management of critically ill-hospitalized patients, while it is recommended to suspend other agents in unstable patients.

Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus globally associated with diarrhea. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in children (\u22645 years) from rural communities in South Africa (SA) suffering from AGE. A total of 141 fecal samples of children \u22645 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were collected from rural Primary Health Care facilities in the Vhembe district of SA between June 2017 and July 2018. Clinical symptoms and demographic data were also recorded. A total of 102 (72%) were outpatients and 39 (28%) were hospitalized patients. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) genotypes were determined using Real-Time Multiplex PCR. DNA extracts of positive samples were confirmed by conventional PCR targeting the NS1 gene. Co-infection with other enteric viruses were determined in HBoV positive samples using Real-Time PCR. HBoV was detected in 8 (5.7%) children with AGE. Children were in the age group between 1-24 months. HBoV1 and HBoV3 genotypes were each detected in 3 (37.5%) stool samples and HBoV2 in 2 (25%) stool samples. Co-infection with other enteric viruses included Rotavirus (37.5%); Adenovirus (37.5%); Norovirus (25%) and Astrovirus (12.5%). HBoV infections could be seen as a potential emerging diarrheal pathogen in South Africa. Further studies are required to understand the role of HBoV infections in children and adults with acute gastroenteritis. Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is recognized as a major cause for mortality in children \u22645 years of age in Africa and other developing countries. Viruses known to be involved in AGE includes Rotavirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus and Adenovirus and have been reported globally. Recently the Human Bocavirus (HBoV) have been reported in numerous studies globally as a potential cause of diarrhea. In this study, the prevalence and genetic diversity of human Bocavirus in children with AGE from rural communities in Limpopo, South Africa were investigated. In total, 141 stool samples from children \u2264 5 years with AGE were assessed for the presence of HBoV using Real-Time PCR. HBoV were detected in 8 (5.7%) patients and included 3 positive samples for HBoV1 and HBoV3 respectively and 2 positive for HBoV2. No HBoV4 were detected.

Contaminated feed has been suggested as a vehicle of transmission for PEDV. The objective of this study was to compare thermal and electron beam processing, and the inclusion of feed additives on the inactivation of PEDV in feed. Feed samples were spiked with PEDV and then heated to 120\u2013145\u00B0C for up to 30 min or irradiated at 0\u201350 kGy. Another set of feed samples spiked with PEDV and mixed with Ultracid P (Nutriad), Activate DA (Novus International), KEM-GEST (Kemin Agrifood), Acid Booster (Agri-Nutrition), sugar or salt was incubated at room temperature (~25\u00B0C) for up to 21 days. At the end of incubation, the virus titers were determined by inoculation of Vero-81 cells and the virus inactivation kinetics were modeled using the Weibull distribution model. The Weibull kinetic parameter delta represented the time or eBeam dose required to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For thermal processing, delta values ranged from 16.52 min at 120\u00B0C to 1.30 min at 145\u00B0C. For eBeam processing, a target dose of 50 kGy reduced PEDV concentration by 3 log. All additives tested were effective in reducing the survival of PEDV when compared with the control sample (delta = 17.23 days). Activate DA (0.81) and KEM-GEST (3.28) produced the fastest inactivation. In conclusion, heating swine feed at temperatures over 130\u00B0C or eBeam processing of feed with a dose over 50 kGy are effective processing steps to reduce PEDV survival. Additionally, the inclusion of selected additives can decrease PEDV survivability.","publish_time":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trudeau, Michaela P.; Verma, Harsha; Sampedro, Fernando; Urriola, Pedro E.; Shurson, Gerald C.; McKelvey, Jessica; Pillai, Suresh D.; Goyal, Sagar M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42bb18ca1f49d74b80f2bab85b3878cade647b08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4920390.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27341670/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158128","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Activate DA"],"organizations":["PEDV","Ultracid P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivation of PEDV","PEDV concentration","survival of PEDV","PEDV survival","eBeam processing of feed","PEDV survivability","inclusion of feed additives","Contaminated feed","thermal processing","set of feed samples","eBeam dose","virus concentration","heating swine feed","kGy","effective processing steps","virus inactivation kinetics","virus titers","electron beam processing","target dose","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","KEM-GEST","delta values","inclusion of selected additives","fastest inactivation","log","days","Weibull kinetic parameter delta","Weibull distribution model","time","temperatures","Acid Booster","Kemin Agrifood","Agri-Nutrition","cells","Novus International","salt","sugar","Nutriad","high mortality","inoculation of Vero","conclusion","Infection","control sample","room temperature","Ultracid P","suckling pigs","study","end of incubation","vehicle of transmission","objective"],"language":"en"},

Internet searches such as these may yield results and data of questionable quality and reliability. Health Library is a free-of-charge medical portal on the Internet providing medical information for the general public. Physician\u2019s Databases, an Internet evidence-based medicine source, provides medical information for health care professionals (HCPs) to support their clinical practice. Both databases are available throughout Finland, but the latter is used only by health professionals and pharmacies. Little is known about how the general public seeks medical information from medical sources on the Internet, how this behavior differs from HCPs\u2019 queries, and what causes possible differences in behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate how the general public\u2019s and HCPs\u2019 information-seeking trends from Internet medical databases differ seasonally and temporally. In addition, we aimed to evaluate whether the general public\u2019s information-seeking trends could be utilized for disease surveillance and whether media coverage could affect these seeking trends. METHODS: Lyme disease, serving as a well-defined disease model with distinct seasonal variation, was chosen as a case study. Two Internet medical databases, Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases, were used. We compared the general public\u2019s article openings on Lyme disease from Health Library to HCPs\u2019 article openings on Lyme disease from Physician\u2019s Databases seasonally across Finland from 2011 to 2015. Additionally, media publications related to Lyme disease were searched from the largest and most popular media websites in Finland. RESULTS: Both databases, Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases, show visually similar patterns in temporal variations of article openings on Lyme disease in Finland from 2011 to 2015. However, Health Library openings show not only an increasing trend over time but also greater fluctuations, especially during peak opening seasons. Outside these seasons, publications in the media coincide with Health Library article openings only occasionally. CONCLUSIONS: Lyme disease\u2013related information-seeking behaviors between the general public and HCPs from Internet medical portals share similar temporal variations, which is consistent with the trend seen in epidemiological data. Therefore, the general public\u2019s article openings could be used as a supplementary source of information for disease surveillance. The fluctuations in article openings appeared stronger among the general public, thus, suggesting that different factors such as media coverage, affect the information-seeking behaviors of the public versus professionals. However, media coverage may also have an influence on HCPs. Not every publication was associated with an increase in openings, but the higher the media coverage by some publications, the higher the general public\u2019s access to Health Library.","publish_time":"2017-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pes\u00E4l\u00E4, Samuli; Virtanen, Mikko J; Sane, Jussi; Mustonen, Pekka; Kaila, Minna; Helve, Otto","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5696583.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.8306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","Health Library"],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["medical information","Health Library openings","Internet medical databases","general public\u2019s information","Health Library article openings","Lyme disease","general public\u2019s article openings","health professionals","HCPs\u2019 information","Physician\u2019s Databases","Internet medical portals","HCPs\u2019 article openings","disease surveillance","related information","health issues","media coverage","general public\u2019s access","media publications","health care professionals","medical sources","temporal variations of article openings","Internet searches","general search engine","supplementary source of information","Finland","seeking trends","well-defined disease model","popular media websites","Internet evidence-based medicine source","similar temporal variations","HCPs\u2019 queries","behaviors","results","similar patterns","greater fluctuations","increasing trend","epidemiological data","case study","data of questionable quality","peak opening seasons","distinct seasonal variation","time","example","specific diseases","CONCLUSIONS","possible differences","different factors","reliability","Google","increase","People","influence","OBJECTIVE","aim","clinical practice","BACKGROUND","pharmacies","METHODS","addition"],"language":"en"},

Methods Only cases meeting the case definition were included in the study. We reviewed the medical records of the cases who were admitted to the local hospitals, interviewed cases by a standard questionnaire, and then described the epidemiologic features and analyzed risk factors by means of a case-control study. We collected pharyngeal swab specimens and sent them to different laboratories for isolation and culture. The laboratory used different detection methods such as DIF, PCR, electron microscope examination and microneutralization assay, to identify and then type the positive specimens. Results A total of 871 cases were reported during the period from April 18 to July 4, 2004. The distribution of onset times presented two peaks, one in late May and another in middle June. The epidemic occurred mainly in the elementary and junior high schools in ten townships of one county, and the mean age of the cases was 12 years (range 7 months to 18 years). The course of the disease was acute, and was characterized by fever accompanied with sore throat and tonsillitis. The WBC count of cases was normal or elevated. The mean duration of illness was 5 days (range 2 to 12 days). No fatalities from illness were reported. A case-control study indicated that the possible risk factors were close contact with a case and/or poultry before onset and sharing of towels among members of the family. The typical CPE was observed through inoculating pharyngeal swab specimens into the HEP-2 cell cultures in different laboratories. An infection of adenovirus type 3 was verified by detecting positive specimens in different methods. Conclusion This investigation demonstrated that the acute respiratory infection in cases was caused by adenovirus type 3. Cases occurred in over 70 schools in ten townships in 2004, and the route of transmission was possibly close contact with cases or droplet transmission.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bao, Changjun; Dworkin,; Ni, Daxin; Jiang, Renjie; Li, Xian; Wang, Zhongze; Shi, Zhiyang; Li, Liang; Wang, Hua","journal":"Journal of Nanjing Medical University","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4940630ef0d7fedb1071bd36b1290bfa20ad28e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007437607600719; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007437607600719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DIF","WBC","CPE"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["interviewed cases","WBC count of cases","different methods","different laboratories","case-control study","positive specimens","acute respiratory infection","different detection methods","infection of adenovirus type","case definition","inoculating pharyngeal swab specimens","close contact","outbreak of acute respiratory tract infection","days","range","townships","years","possible risk factors","mean duration of illness","route of transmission","droplet transmission","mean age","county of Jiangsu Province","junior high schools","distribution of onset times","PCR","electron microscope examination","etiology","microneutralization assay","cell cultures","epidemiology","peaks","towels","fever","standard questionnaire","local hospitals","investigation","typical CPE","epidemiologic features","sore throat","tonsillitis","members","China","isolation","poultry","months","laboratory","Abstract Objective","family","course","disease","Conclusion","medical records","epidemic","fatalities","total","period"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that TGEV infection induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in both asynchronous and synchronized PK-15 and ST cells, while UV-inactivated TGEV lost the ability of induction of cell cycle arrest. TGEV infection promoted p21 accumulation, down-regulated cell cycle-regulatory proteins cyclins B1, cdc2, cdk2 and PCNA.

In addition, TGEV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA, and virus titer were higher in the cells released from S-phase- or G2/M phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G0/G1 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18h p.i.

This study presents a review of the methods for the assessment of pedestrian level wind climate, different wind comfort criterion and various techniques to evaluate the wind speed at the pedestrian level. In later sections, brief review for the influence of different parameters related to building design and configuration on pedestrian level wind is presented. After analyzing previous literature it is suggested that there is a strong need for the homogenization of different wind comfort criterion, as it may lead to different consequences for the architects. Among various wind tunnel measurement techniques, use of Irwin probe is simple and accurate compared to hot-wire anemometry and it can be installed at numerous locations for simultaneous measurement of pedestrian level wind speed. For numerical simulation, Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes based technique has been used by various researchers, although this technique is not accurate as much as large eddy simulation and detached eddy simulation.

Environmental quality is arguably the least developed component within the One Health framework, but can be guided by expertise within the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC). Despite SETAC\u0027s long history of tripartite (academic, government, business) interdisciplinary environmental science activities, the term \u201COne Health\u201D is seldom used in SETAC communications (i.e., many of SETAC\u0027s activities are guided by One Health, but it is called by other names in SETAC\u0027s journals, newsletters, and presentations).

Past studies have shown that the perceived susceptibility, the perceived severity of being afflicted with life-threatening diseases, and the perceived benefits of using a facemask are predictors of a person\u2019s use of a facemask. However, I argue that people wear a facemask not merely for infection prevention, and various sociocultural reasons have been motivating people to wear (and not wear) a facemask. Facemasks thus have sociocultural implications for people. Research on the sociocultural meanings of facemasks is scant, and even less is known on how the shifting sociocultural meanings of facemasks are related to the changing social environment, which, I argue, serve as remarkable underlying factors for people using (and not using) facemasks. As new infectious diseases such as avian influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have been emerging, threatening people\u2019s health worldwide, and because facemasks have been documented to have substantial efficacy in the prevention of infection transmission, understanding the sociocultural meanings of facemasks has significant implications for public health policymakers and health care providers in designing a socially and culturally responsive public health and infection control policy for the community. METHODS: A qualitative research design involving the use of 40 individual, in-depth semistructured interviews and a phenomenological analysis approach were adopted. RESULTS: The sociocultural meanings of the facemask have been undergoing constant change, from positive to negative, which resulted in the participants displaying hesitation in using a facemask in the post-SARS era. Because it represents a violation of societal ideologies and traditional Chinese cultural beliefs, the meanings of the facemask that had developed during the SARS outbreak failed to be sustained in the post-SARS era. CONCLUSION: The changes in meaning not only influenced the participants\u2019 perceptions of the facemask but also influenced their perceptions of people who use facemasks, which ultimately influenced their health behavior, preventing them from using facemasks in the post-SARS era. These findings have critical implications for designing a culturally responsive infection prevention and facemask usage policy in the future.","publish_time":"2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siu, Judy Yuen-man","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10f87d75360ca119636fcd75da502bcb0bf7845d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4855818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27145823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-016-0358-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["efficacy of facemasks","shifting sociocultural meanings of facemasks","sociocultural implications","facemask usage policy","responsive infection prevention","perceptions of people","prevention of infection transmission","post-SARS era","responsive public health","health behavior","infection control policy","public health policymakers","various sociocultural reasons","SARS outbreak","health care providers","threatening people\u2019s health","significant implications","perceived severity","perceived benefits","critical implications","perceived susceptibility","person\u2019s use","life-threatening diseases","substantial efficacy","participants\u2019 perceptions","new infectious diseases","qualitative research design","avian influenza","traditional Chinese cultural beliefs","in-depth semistructured interviews","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","violation of societal ideologies","phenomenological analysis approach","clinical importance","predictors","METHODS","BACKGROUND","remarkable underlying factors","constant change","community","future","changing social environment","Past studies","findings","hesitation","RESULTS","international literature","CONCLUSION","changes"],"language":"en"},

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17\u201345% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34\u201358%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24\u201365% (and peak deaths 15\u201369%), compared to 2\u20139% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9\u201318%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eikenberry, Steffen E.; Mancuso, Marina; Iboi, Enahoro; Phan, Tin; Eikenberry, Keenan; Kuang, Yang; Kostelich, Eric; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfc39cdae5551d68568656f3a0fbec7a657bd81d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4aee10ea00a42707483fa3584bb45819476a782b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186508.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300117; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300117; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York","Washington"],"keyphrases":["effective masks","use of face masks","weak masks","Face mask use","community transmission of COVID","effective transmission rate","ineffective face masks","asymptomatic transmission","curtailing community transmission","underlying transmission rate","general public","baseline transmission","peak deaths","community-wide impact of mask use","New York state","Washington","Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios","peak daily death rate","peak death reduction","broad adoption","peak hospitalizations","US states of New York","general population","asymptomatic public","coverage rate","community-wide benefits","product of mask effectiveness","fraction","mortality reduction","pandemic","projected deaths","non-pharmaceutical practices","non-pharmaceutical measures","high value","epidemic dynamics","Model simulations","infectious contacts","compartmental model","immediate near universal","linear proportion","illness","data relevant","conjunction","healthy persons","epidemiologic outcomes","burden","months","spread","social-distancing","changes","respect","results","compliance","order","potential","intervention"],"language":"en"},

MERS-CoV was found to produce severe respiratory illness with case-fatality rates near 50%, and may be transmitted person-to-person in instances of close physical contact, such as among family members and to health care workers. As mice, hamsters, ferrets, and cynomolgus macaques are either not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection or do not develop observable clinical disease, we sought to determine whether rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) can be used as a model of MERS-CoV infection and disease. Animals challenged with MERS-CoV via multiple combined infection routes rapidly developed pneumonia, and we observed other clinical signs of illness, virus shedding, and virus replication in respiratory tissues. Using microarrays to compare transcripts associated with histopathologic lesions removed from the lungs of infected animals, we identified 173 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) associated with lung lesions on day 3 post-infection concurrent with peak clinical signs. Functional analysis indicated that these genes were predominantly associated with proinflammatory processes, recruitment and chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, and antiviral immunity. Using singular value decomposition coupled multidimensional scaling (SVD-MDS), we also identified changes in similar inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a rapid activation of innate immune and inflammatory processes in leukocytes after infection. These data were consistent with cytokine and chemokine profiles in the blood of animals. Due to the urgent need for an effective therapeutic means of treating MERS-CoV patients, we used this rhesus macaque model to evaluate post-exposure treatment with combination interferon (IFN)-a2b and ribavirin (RBV), and identified key transcriptional signatures associated with disease severity and treatment efficacy. Animals treated with IFN-a2b/RBV beginning 8h post-infection did not develop significant clinical or severe histopathologic signs of disease, breathing abnormalities, or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and showed reduced viral loads and lower levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines. Microarray analysis of treated animals showed significant induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and fewer upregulated transcripts associated with inflammatory processes. Additionally, we identified a subset of statistically significant DEGs associated with signaling pathways such as hedgehog, which has been linked to airway function and protection against pulmonary injury. Together, these data indicate that treatment of MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques with IFN-a2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication and improves clinical outcome, and suggests a transcriptomic basis for therapeutic efficacy. As these two drugs are already used together in the clinic, IFN-a2b and ribavirin may be useful for therapeutic intervention and patient management of new human MERS-CoV cases.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rasmussen, Angela L.; Falzarano, Darryl; de Wit, Emmie; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Scott, Dana P.; Brining, Douglas; Bushmaker, Trent; Martellaro, Cynthia; Benecke, Arndt G.; Munster, Vincent J.; Feldmann, Heinz; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466613004833; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466613004833","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV patients","treatment of MERS","model of MERS","IFN-a2b","CoV-infected rhesus macaques","blood of animals","post-infection concurrent","h post-infection","clinical signs of illness","observable clinical disease","similar inflammatory genes","patient management of new human MERS-CoV cases","peak clinical signs","clinical outcome","ribavirin","severe histopathologic signs of disease","lungs of infected animals","virus replication","stimulated genes","significant DEGs","proinflammatory processes","disease severity","therapeutic efficacy","treatment efficacy","Microarray analysis of treated animals","post-exposure treatment","chemotaxis of inflammatory cells","significant induction of interferon","severe respiratory illness","multiple combined infection routes","virus shedding","therapeutic intervention","respiratory tissues","histopathologic lesions","rhesus macaque model","cynomolgus macaques","RBV","data","effective therapeutic means","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","combination interferon","developed pneumonia","lung lesions","transmitted person","Functional analysis","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","fewer upregulated transcripts","radiographic evidence of pneumonia","lower levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines","rapid activation of innate immune","reduced viral loads","multidimensional scaling","ISGs","day","abnormalities","family members","novel betacoronavirus","chemokine profiles","instances of close physical contact","key transcriptional signatures","changes","recruitment","leukocytes","singular value decomposition","case-fatality rates","SVD-MDS","transcriptomic basis","airway function","protection","pulmonary injury","health care workers","hamsters","ferrets","urgent need","antiviral immunity","pathways","Macaca mulatta","mice","subset","microarrays","Arabian Peninsula","hedgehog","drugs"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the characterization of the complete genome sequence of NarPV. The genome is 15,276 nucleotides in length, conforming to the rule-of-six, and has a genome organization typical of most members of the family, with six transcriptional units in the order 3\u2032-N\u2013P-M-F\u2013H-L-5\u2032.

Currently, Oseltamivir is being stockpiled in many countries potentially affected by the influenza A virus subtype H5N1 epidemic. To identify this change in Oseltamivir-treated patients, a method based on real-time PCR using two labeled TaqMan probes was developed for its rapid detection. In order to validate the method, Oseltamivir specimen from treated (Oseltamivir-resistant strain from a Vietnamese patient, two Oseltamivir-treated tigers) and untreated subjects have been used for this study. The results thus obtained as well as those derived from clone selection and sequencing showed that TaqMan probes could clearly discriminate wild type H274 from the mutant 274Y variant. The sensitivity of this assay was as low as 10 copies/\u03BCl and allowed the detection of the mutation in a mixture of wild type and mutant. Overall, the assay based on real-time PCR with two labeled TaqMan probes described here should be useful for detecting Oseltamivir-resistant H274Y H5N1 influenza A virus in many species and various sources of specimens with high sensitivity and specificity.

To enter cells, hantaviruses fuse their envelope membrane with host cell membranes. Previously, we have shown that the Gc envelope glycoprotein is the viral fusion protein sharing characteristics with class II fusion proteins. The ectodomain of class II fusion proteins is composed of three domains connected by a stem region to a transmembrane anchor in the viral envelope. These fusion proteins can be inhibited through exogenous fusion protein fragments spanning domain III (DIII) and the stem region. Such fragments are thought to interact with the core of the fusion protein trimer during the transition from its pre-fusion to its post-fusion conformation. Based on our previous homology model structure for Gc from Andes hantavirus (ANDV), here we predicted and generated recombinant DIII and stem peptides to test whether these fragments inhibit hantavirus membrane fusion and cell entry. Recombinant ANDV DIII was soluble, presented disulfide bridges and beta-sheet secondary structure, supporting the in silico model. Using DIII and the C-terminal part of the stem region, the infection of cells by ANDV was blocked up to 60% when fusion of ANDV occurred within the endosomal route, and up to 95% when fusion occurred with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the fragments impaired ANDV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion, and cross-inhibited the fusion mediated by the glycoproteins from Puumala virus (PUUV). The Gc fragments interfered in ANDV cell entry by preventing membrane hemifusion and pore formation, retaining Gc in a non-resistant homotrimer stage, as described for DIII and stem peptide inhibitors of class II fusion proteins. Collectively, our results demonstrate that hantavirus Gc shares not only structural, but also mechanistic similarity with class II viral fusion proteins, and will hopefully help in developing novel therapeutic strategies against hantaviruses.","publish_time":"2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barriga, Gonzalo P.; Villal\u00F3n-Letelier, Fernando; M\u00E1rquez, Chantal L.; Bignon, Eduardo A.; Acu\u00F1a, Rodrigo; Ross, Breyan H.; Monasterio, Octavio; Mardones, Gonzalo A.; Vidal, Simon E.; Tischler, Nicole D.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac7d8fb495888876f03df56a1d3a3faa1f05e770.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4945073.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27414047/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004799","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DIII","ANDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion of ANDV","pre-fusion","hantavirus membrane fusion","viral fusion proteins","fusion protein trimer","exogenous fusion protein fragments","post-fusion conformation","fragments impaired ANDV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion","Gc fragments","ANDV cell entry","Recombinant ANDV DIII","stem region","envelope membrane","recombinant DIII","Gc envelope glycoprotein","hantavirus Gc shares","viral envelope","stem peptides","Hantaviruses","stem peptide inhibitors of class","membrane hemifusion","Andes hantavirus","ectodomain of class","plasma membrane","hantavirus pulmonary syndrome","host cell membranes","renal syndrome","previous homology model structure","silico model","infection of cells","beta-sheet secondary structure","disulfide bridges","hemorrhagic fever","characteristics","mechanistic similarity","pore formation","transmembrane anchor","transition","humans","glycoproteins","non-resistant homotrimer stage","domains","Puumala virus","C-terminal","PUUV","novel therapeutic strategies","results","core","endosomal route"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, numerous proofs of concept have established that plants can produce biologically active recombinant proteins and immunologically relevant vaccine antigens that are comparable to those made in conventional expression systems. Driving many of these advances is the remarkable plasticity of the plant proteome which enables extensive engineering of the host cell, as well as the development of improved expression vectors facilitating higher levels of protein production. To date, the only plant\u2010derived viral glycoprotein to be tested in humans is the influenza haemagglutinin which expresses at ~50 mg/kg. However, many other viral glycoproteins that have potential as vaccine immunogens only accumulate at low levels in planta. A critical consideration for the production of many of these proteins in heterologous expression systems is the complexity of post\u2010translational modifications, such as control of folding, glycosylation and disulphide bridging, which is required to reproduce the native glycoprotein structure. In this review, we will address potential shortcomings of plant expression systems and discuss strategies to optimally exploit the technology for the production of immunologically relevant and structurally authentic glycoproteins for use as vaccine immunogens.","publish_time":"2018-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Margolin, Emmanuel; Chapman, Ros; Williamson, Anna\u2010Lise; Rybicki, Edward P.; Meyers, Ann E.","journal":"Plant Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00c88aab2bfcca0db253c972382e5eee245d071e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6097131.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of recombinant proteins","conventional expression systems","heterologous expression systems","potential shortcomings of plant expression systems","vaccine immunogens","plant proteome","conventional production platforms","relevant vaccine antigens","development of improved expression vectors","active recombinant proteins","higher levels of protein production","Plant molecular farming","viral glycoproteins","derived viral glycoprotein","authentic glycoproteins","low levels","native glycoprotein structure","scalable approach","complexity of post\u2010translational modifications","control of folding","extensive engineering","plants","use","numerous proofs of concept","recent years","remarkable plasticity","humans","strategies","host cell","glycosylation","disulphide","alternative","countries","technology","influenza haemagglutinin","advances","planta","review","critical consideration","date"],"language":"en"},

With the continuing human outbreak of H5N1 beginning in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, focus on influenza and other respiratory viruses has been increased. It has been accepted for decades that international travel via jet aircraft is a major vector for global spread of influenza, and epidemiological differences between tropical and temperate regions observed. Thus we wanted to study how indoor environmental conditions (enclosed locations) in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. To this end, a survey consisting of 632 readings of temperature (T) versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations were compared to 102 such readings in 2 Australian cities, including ground transport, hotels, shops, offices and other publicly accessible locations, along with 586 time course readings from aircraft. RESULTS: An influenza transmission risk contour map was developed for T versus RH. Empirical equations were created for estimating: 1. risk relative to temperature and RH, and 2. time parameterized influenza transmission risk. Using the transmission risk contours and equations, transmission risk for each country\u0027s locations was compared with influenza reports from the countries. Higher risk enclosed locations in the tropics included new automobile transport, luxury buses, luxury hotels, and bank branches. Most temperate locations were high risk. CONCLUSION: Environmental control is recommended for public health mitigation focused on higher risk enclosed locations. Public health can make use of the methods developed to track potential vulnerability to aerosol influenza. The methods presented can also be used in influenza modeling. Accounting for differential aerosol transmission using T and RH can potentially explain anomalies of influenza epidemiology in addition to seasonality in temperate climates.","publish_time":"2010-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanley, Brian P; Borup, Birthe","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f1378b1fa0165baf6bd31d9e4d0d66d818a37c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2893155.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-98; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20470403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aerosol influenza","temperate locations","influenza reports","influenza modeling","Higher risk enclosed locations","time parameterized influenza transmission risk","influenza transmission risk contour map","risk relative","transmission risk contours","global spread of influenza","high risk","country\u0027s locations","accessible locations","RH","anomalies of influenza epidemiology","different enclosed locations air travelers","differential aerosol transmission","temperate regions","temperate climates","readings of temperature","tropics","luxury hotels","winter temperate zones","time course readings","methods","public health mitigation","luxury buses","ground transport","jet aircraft","Environmental control","relative humidity","tropical nations","Empirical equations","new automobile transport","indoor environmental conditions","major vector","epidemiological differences","addition","shops","offices","seasonality","international travel","Australian cities","decades","potential vulnerability","Accounting","RESULTS","bank branches","continuing human outbreak of H5N1","recent years","attention","survey","BACKGROUND","estimating","CONCLUSION","H1N1 pandemic","respiratory viruses","countries","world","end"],"language":"en"},

Its coding region constitutes less than 50% of the complete gene length, enabling SH gene to be highly variable and the SH protein highly conserved. In standard HRSV molecular epidemiology studies, solely sequences of the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein gene (HVR2) are analyzed. To what extent do the strains identical in HVR2 differ elsewhere in genomes is rarely investigated. Our goal was to investigate whether diversity and inter-genotype differences observed for HVR2 are also present in the SH gene. METHODS: We sequenced 198 clinical samples collected within a limited area and time frame. In this HRSV collection, rapid and significant changes in HVR2 occurred. RESULTS: Over 20% of strains from this pool (containing HRSV genotypes NA1, ON1, GA5, BA9 and BA10) would be incorrectly assumed to be identical to another strain if only the HVR2 region was analysed. The majority of differences found in SH gene were located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). Seven indels were detected, one was genotype GA5 specific. An in-frame deletion of 9 nucleotides (coding for amino acids 49\u201351) was observed in one of group A strains. Fifteen different SH protein sequences were detected; 68% of strains possessed the consensus sequence and most of others differed from the consensus in only one amino acid (only 4 strains differed in 2 amino acids). The majority of differing amino acids in group A viruses had the same identity as the corresponding amino acids in group B strains. When analysis was restricted to strains with identical HVR2 nucleotide sequences and differing SH protein sequences, 75% of differences observed in the SH ectodomain were located within region coding for amino acids 49\u201351. CONCLUSIONS: Basing HRSV molecular epidemiology studies solely on HVR2 largely underestimates the complexity of circulating virus populations. In strain identification, broadening of the genomic target sequence to SH gene would provide a more comprehensive insight into viral pool versatility and its evolutionary processes.

To investigate the penetration of BHV-1, we performed the quantitative measurement of viral DNA by quantitative competitive (QC)PCR in infected cells. In MDBK cells, virions attached to the cell surface, penetrated into the cells and were transported to the nucleus. However in HmLu-1, only a small fraction of the virions attached to the cell surface were allowed to penetrate.

The \u201CBreda\u201D agent had the morphology of a virus and possessed a hemagglutinin. Antigenic studies showed the virus to be antigenically different from bovine coronavirus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine rotavirus, bovine parvovirus and bovine pestivirus (BVD). Attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus was either spherical or kidney shaped, with 7\u20139 nm peplomers on the surface. A few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17\u201320 nm, but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris. Three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus. The virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon, as judged by immunofluorescence. The virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces; excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces. There was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of D-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed, suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus. Fourteen of fortyseven calves in the outbreak were infected with the virus, virus was not identified in other farm outbreaks of the disease.","publish_time":"1982-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woode, G.

Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. Methods An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials. Results COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained. Conclusions The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care. When alterations to the delivery of care are mandated, efforts should be taken to minimize risks and maximize safety while approximating standard practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pothuri, Bhavana; Secord, Angeles Alvarez; Armstrong, Deborah K.; Chan, John; Huh, Warner; Kesterson, Joshua; Liu, Joyce F.; Moore, Kathleen; Fader, Amanda N.; Westin, Shannon N.; Naumann, R.

This exemplifies the required expansion of our knowledge of the virus diversity present in wildlife, as well as the potential transmission of these viruses to domestic animals or humans. METHODS: In the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples (n = 42) collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting the northern part of Spain using random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing. Samples were collected from American mink (Neovison vison), European mink (Mustela lutreola), European polecat (Mustela putorius), European pine marten (Martes martes), stone marten (Martes foina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles) of the family of Mustelidae; common genet (Genetta genetta) of the family of Viverridae; red fox (Vulpes vulpes) of the family of Canidae and European wild cat (Felis silvestris) of the family of Felidae. RESULTS: A number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a kobuvirus and picobirnaviruses.

Recent studies demonstrated that the incidence of severe or fatal M. pneumoniae was gradually increasing, which may be related to the excessive inflammation. However, the exact pathogenesis of excessive inflammation in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia(MPP) is still unclear. This study aimed to reveal the role of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 axis in children with MPP. METHODS: Children hospitalized in Respiratory Department during Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2015 were enrolled. All children enrolled was confirmed with MP infection using real-time PCR and ELISA. Children were excluded if they were co-infected with other pathogens. A total of 52 children with MPP and 26 controls were enrolled. miR-29c expression in monocytes of children with MPP was determined by real-time PCR and soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) and IL-17 were determined by ELISA, and explore their clinical significance. miR-29c overexpression and silencing technology and luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm whether B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c. The levels of transcription factor ROR-\u03B3t in CD4\u002B T cells and cytokine IL-17A in supernatant were detected after stimulated by different concentrations of B7-H3 fusion protein in vitro. RESULTS: Of all 52 children with MPP, the mean age of the children were 77 \u00B1 33 months, and 23 cases were male accounting for 44.2%. Nineteen cases had pleural effusion accounting for 36.5%. Children with MPP had significantly lower level of miR-29c and higher level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 compared to controls (both P \u003C 0.05). The level of miR-29c significantly increased during convalescent phase compared to that of acute phase while sB7-H3 and IL-17 significantly decreased during convalescent phase (both P \u003C 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 in children with MPP during acute-stage (r = 0.361,P = 0.009). Children with MPP combined with pleural effusion had significantly higher level of sB7-H3 compared to those without pleural effusion (9952.3 \u00B1 3065.3 vs. 7449.7 \u00B1 2231.5, pg/ml), and the levels of sB7-H3 was positively correlated with the number of days of fever. The level of miR-29c was negatively correlated with M. pneumoniae specific IgG, IgM level. High concentrations of B7-H3(15\u03BCg/ml) could enhance ROR-\u03B3t expression and increase IL-17A. Functional studies based on luciferase reporter assay and immunofluorescence staining suggested that B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c, and miR-29c silencing or overexpression could up- or down-regulate the expression of B7-H3 in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The axis of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 plays a vital role in children with MPP through excessive inflammation. miR-29c and B7-H3 may be the new target for the prevention and treatment of MPP, and may be the novel and potential biomarkers for the assessment of prognosis.","publish_time":"2019-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qing-ling; Wu, Yin-yin; Sun, Hui-ming; Gu, Wen-jing; Zhang, Xin-xing; Wang, Mei-juan; Yan, Yong-dong; Hao, Chuang-li; Ji, Wei; Chen, Zheng-rong","journal":"Ital J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22837889db9cf1b27c6d98ccb6ab7d6816a41acc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6518711.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088519/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-019-0655-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["Respiratory Department"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sB7-H3","soluble B7-H3","monocytes of children","c expression","role of miR","axis of miR","lower level of miR","c silencing","c overexpression","expression of B7","H3 fusion protein","treatment of MPP","direct target of miR","higher level of sB7","different concentrations of B7","High concentrations of B7","IgM level","levels of sB7","cytokine IL","Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia","pleural effusion accounting","acute phase","convalescent phase","ROR-\u03B3t expression","pneumoniae specific IgG","luciferase reporter assay","Th17 axis","real-time PCR","new target","exact pathogenesis of excessive inflammation","ELISA","cases","controls","levels of transcription factor ROR-\u03B3t","silencing technology","acute-stage","vital role","T cells","Functional studies","Recent studies","male accounting","CD4","immunofluorescence staining","MP infection","incidence of severe","potential biomarkers","novel","prevention","THP","mean age","assessment of prognosis","common causes of community","supernatant","METHODS","Respiratory Department","months","positive correlation","BACKGROUND","\u03BCg","number of days","pathogens","fever","clinical significance","CONCLUSIONS","total","study","RESULTS","pg"],"language":"en"},

The first is to explain the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths. The second is to suggest a strategy to cope with future epidemic threats having accelerated viral infectivity in society. Using data on N = 55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 7th, 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 \u03BCm or less in diameter) or ozone in previous years. In particular, hinterland cities with average higher number of days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (and a low intensity of wind speed) have a very high number of infected people on 7th April 2020 (arithmetic mean about 2200 infected, with average polluted days greater than 80), than coastal cities also having days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 or ozone but with high intensity of wind speed (arithmetic mean about 944.70 infected individuals, with about 60 average polluted days); moreover, cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM10), they have a very high average number of infected people (about 3350 infected individuals, 7th April 2020), whereas cities having less than 100 days of air pollution, they have a lower average number of infected individuals (about 1014). The findings here also suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which Italian provincial capitals can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, is about 48 days. Moreover, results here reveal that the explanatory variable of air pollution in cities under study seems to be a more important predictor in the initial phase of diffusion (on 17th March 2020, b1 = 1.27, p \u003C 0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b2 = 0.31, p \u003C 0.05). In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April 2020 with b\u20321 = 0.81, p \u003C 0.001) also because of indirect effect of lockdown, whereas coefficient of transmission by interpersonal contacts has stability (b\u20322 = 0.31, p \u003C 0.01). This result reveals that accelerated transmissions dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of \u201Cair pollution-to-human transmission\u201D rather than \u201Chuman-to-human transmission\u201D. Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are different for each region (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc.). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study of Italy suggest that a proactive strategy to cope with future epidemics is to also apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities- having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog days-that seem to have an environment that may damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, healthcare and health sector.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coccia, Mario","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f816537d34fec5cc29ae5c992c64e83f58541e5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720319872?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720319872; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days of air pollution","air pollution of cities","mechanism of air pollution","transmission dynamics of COVID","fog days","max number of days","high number of infected people","average higher number of days","high average number of infected people","human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity","explanatory variable of air pollution","limits","PM10","data of infected individuals","transmissions dynamics of COVID","accelerated diffusion of COVID","fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity","lower average number of infected individuals","hinterland cities","polluting cities","average polluted days greater","coefficient of transmission","coastal cities","vast diffusion of COVID","high intensity of wind speed","biological characteristics of viral infectivity","high association","high level of deaths","health level of individuals","ozone","environmental science","low intensity of wind speed","low wind speed","high percentage of moisture","case study of Italy","impact of future epidemics similar","immune system of people","meteorological conditions","future epidemic threats","arithmetic mean","North Italy","interpersonal contacts","comprehensive strategy","proactive strategy","initial phase of diffusion","geo-environmental determinants","society","regions","results","biological characteristics of virus","Italian province capitals","Italian provincial capitals","health sector","specific factors","phase of maturity","general factors","terms of biology","sustainability science","socioeconomic terms","presence of polluting industrialization","habits","reduction of levels","incubation period","complex interaction","diameter","particulate matter","healthcare","sustainable policy","\u03BCm","important predictor","stability","indirect effect of lockdown","result reveals","systemic causes","previous years","sex","b2","b1","goals","Lessons","findings"],"language":"en"},

A variety of very sensitive immunological methods is now available for detecting virus-specific proteins in secretions of the respiratory and alimentary tracts. Monoclonal antibodies help to make these more specific. Virus nucleic acids can also be detected in secretions and cells in situ by hybridization with purified radio-labelled nucleic acid. Virus diseases specifically surveyed include varicella zoster and measles, both very important in immuno-suppressed patients; epidemic influenza; and the human papilloma viruses, of which 33 different types are now known, and which cause not common warts on hands and feet, but also venereally transmitted inapparent papillomas upon the surface of the uterine cervix, often leading to cervical carcinoma. The problems of diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are reviewed. The aetiology of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis is still largely obscure, but a retrovirus may be involved. The diagnosis of rabies is also considered.","publish_time":"1985-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flewett, T H","journal":"Br Med Bull","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13009dd6366bfb720732cd5746d422cbf589f044.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus diseases","Virus infections","virus-specific proteins","Virus nucleic acids","secretions","virus particles of characteristic morphology","problems of diagnosis","rapid diagnosis","diagnosis of rabies","various diseases","non-B hepatitis","aetiology of chronic non-","sensitive immunological methods","human papilloma viruses","effective antiviral chemotherapy","epidemic influenza","feet","surface","hybridization","purified radio","immuno-suppressed patients","venereally transmitted inapparent papillomas","earliest symptoms","situ","varicella zoster","uterine cervix","paper concentrates","hands","measles","cells","life-threatening illnesses","common warts","Experience","variety","alimentary tracts","immunodeficiency syndrome","cervical carcinoma","immune serum","different types","large numbers","Monoclonal antibodies","rotavirus","diarrhoea","Sensitivity","retrovirus"],"language":"en"},

We recently reported that enteral delivery of proteins markedly stimulated global duodenal protein synthesis in carbohydrate-fed healthy humans, but specifically affected proteins remain unknown. Objective: We aimed to assess the influence of an enteral protein supply on the duodenal mucosal proteome in carbohydrate-fed humans. Design: Six healthy volunteers received for 5 h, on 2 occasions and in random order, either an enteral infusion of maltodextrins alone (0.25 g \u00B7 kg(\u22121) \u00B7 h(\u22121)) mimicking the fed state or maltodextrins with a protein powder (0.14 g proteins \u00B7 kg(\u22121) \u00B7 h(\u22121)). Endoscopic duodenal biopsy specimens were then collected and frozen until analysis. A 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\u2013based comparative proteomics analysis was then performed, and differentially expressed proteins (at least \u00B11.5-fold change; Student\u2019s t test, P \u003C 0.05) were identified by mass spectrometry. Protein expression changes were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Results: Thirty-two protein spots were differentially expressed after protein delivery compared with maltodextrins alone: 28 and 4 spots were up- or downregulated, respectively. Among the 22 identified proteins, 11 upregulated proteins were involved either in the cytoskeleton (ezrin, moesin, plastin 1, lamin B1, vimentin, and \u03B2-actin) or in protein biosynthesis (glutamyl-prolyl\u2013transfer RNA synthetase, glutaminyl\u2013transfer RNA synthetase, elongation factor 2, elongation factor 1\u03B4, and eukaryotic translation and initiation factor 3 subunit f). Conclusions: Enteral delivery of proteins altered the duodenal mucosal proteome and mainly stimulated the expression of proteins involved in cytoskeleton and protein biosynthesis. These results suggest that protein supply may affect intestinal morphology by stimulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling.

CONTEXT AND SETTING: Our large (\u003E12,000,000 tests/year) academic hospital laboratory is the Belgian National Reference Center (NRC) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. We performed a moving total of \u003E 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in parallel to standard routine testing since the start of the outbreak. A LIS implementation team dedicated to develop tools to remove the bottlenecks, primarily situated in the pre- and post-analytical phase, was established early in the crisis. RESULTS: We outline the design, implementation and requirements of LIS functionality related to managing increased test demand during the COVID-19 crisis, including tools for test ordering, standardized order sets integrated into a computerized provider order entry module, notifications on shipping requirements, automated triaging based on digital metadata forms, and the establishment of databases with contact details of other laboratories and primary care physicians to enable automated reporting. We also describe our approach to data mining and reporting of actionable daily summary statistics to governing bodies and other policymakers. DISCUSSION: Rapidly developed, agile extendable LIS functionality and its meaningful use alleviates the administrative burden on laboratory personnel and improves turn-around-time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. It will be important to maintain an environment that is conducive for the rapid adoption of meaningful LIS tools post-COVID crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weemaes, Matthias; Martens, Steven; Cuypers, Lize; Van Elslande, Jan; Hoet, Katrien; Welkenhuysen, Joris; Goossens, Ria; Wouters, Stijn; Houben, Els; Jeuris, Kirsten; Laenen, Lies; Bruyninckx, Katrien; Beuselinck, Kurt; Andr\u00E9, Emmanuel; Depypere, Melissa; Desmet, Stefanie; Lagrou, Katrien; Van Ranst, Marc; Verdonck, Ann K L C; Goveia, Jermaine","journal":"J Am Med Inform Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eb5fba2b7c8dc5f552903ea4b353f0c614dc986.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348469/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["requirements of LIS functionality","LIS implementation team","SARS-CoV","test ordering","agile extendable LIS functionality","automated reporting","rapid adoption of meaningful LIS tools post-COVID crisis","requirements of laboratory information system","laboratory personnel","shipping requirements","result reporting","time of SARS","academic hospital laboratory","increased test demand","standard routine testing","meaningful use","automated triaging","PCR tests","reporting of actionable daily summary statistics","standardized order sets","post-analytical phase","computerized provider order entry module","notifications","NRC","Belgian National Reference Center","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","laboratories","primary care physicians","sample flow","registration","digital metadata forms","establishment of databases","contact details","data mining","administrative burden","bodies","year","turn","start","development","design","environment","approach","moving total","CONTEXT","SETTING","policymakers","DISCUSSION","outbreak","bottlenecks","pandemic","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This shift in the way that healthcare is delivered raises new concerns over community healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). A literature search between 2000 and December 2013 was conducted in databases including PubMed, SciVerse ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. National and international guideline and policy documents were searched using Google. Many terms were used in the literature searches, including \u2018nosocomial\u2019, \u2018healthcare infection\u2019, \u2018community\u2019 and \u2018nursing home\u2019. The rates of HCAI in community healthcare are similar to the rates found in the acute hospital setting, but the types of infection differ, with a greater focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the community and ventilator-associated pneumonias in the hospital setting. Patients who acquire a community HCAI are more likely to exhibit reduced physical condition, have increased levels of morbidity and have higher mortality rates than individuals without infection. Infection control programmes have been developed worldwide to reduce the rates of hospital HCAIs. Such interventions are equally as valid in the community, but how best to implement them and their subsequent impact are much less well understood. The future is clear: HCAIs in the community are going to become an ever-increasing burden and it is critical that our approach to these infections is brought quickly in line with present hospital sector standards.","publish_time":"2014-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackay, W.

The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip and knee arthroplasties in an Italian high-volume orthopedic center, located in the region of the country first and worst affected by the Coronavirus. METHODS: Data from institutional database were retrospectively analyzed to obtain the number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed from February 24 to April 10 2020. The figures were compared with those of the same 7-week period of the last year (2019). RESULTS: The number of hip and knee arthroplasties showed a decrease from 706 in the same period of 2019 to 166 (76.5% less) in the current year. In 2019, a mean of 101 \u00B1 9 hip and knee arthroplasties were performed per week compared with a mean of 24 \u00B1 34 in 2020. Ten patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV2 during hospital stay. Two of these patients died after a regular postoperative period after developing unexpectedly COVID-19 during rehabilitation. The mortality in the 7-week period of the current year was 1.2% compared with 0% in 2019. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of COVID-19 had a considerable effect in our center on the number of hip and knee arthroplasties that rapidly decreased to 0 in parallel to the worsening of the situation in the country. Efforts will be soon requested because our practice is going to deal with the after-effects of the pandemic in the near future.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019Apolito, Rocco; Faraldi, Martina; Ottaiano, Immacolata; Zagra, Luigi","journal":"J Arthroplasty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22d3f724a4498fabcfb51c5c423f6ab1dad7686f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194696.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883540320304447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370923/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883540320304447; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.057","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["knee arthroplasties","number of hip","week period","outbreak of COVID","current year","pandemic","regular postoperative period","patients","country","mean","Coronavirus disease","Italian high-volume orthopedic center","world","decrease","healthcare systems","SARS-CoV2","considerable effect","METHODS","institutional database","hospital","worsening","situation","strain","region","impact","important consequences","near future","paper","BACKGROUND","after-effects","CONCLUSION","mortality","RESULTS","aim","rehabilitation","Efforts","practice","figures"],"language":"en"},

Id proteins can be produced via tumor-myeloma hybridomas or recombinant methods in mammalian, bacteria, or insect cells. We now demonstrate that terminal mannose residues, characteristic of recombinant proteins produced in insect cells, yield Id proteins with significantly enhanced immunostimulatory properties compared to Id proteins derived from mammalian cells. Recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cell-derived Id showed higher binding to and activation of human dendritic cells mediated by mannose receptors. In vivo, insect cell-derived Id elicited higher levels of tumor-specific CD8(\u002B) CTL and improved eradication of pre-established murine lymphoma. Insect cell and mammalian Id generated similar levels of tumor-specific antibodies, showing no impairment in antibody responses to native tumor antigen despite the glycoslylation differences in the immunogen. Combining insect cell production and maleimide-based KLH conjugation offered the highest levels of anti-tumor immunity. Our data comparing sources of recombinant Id protein tumor antigens used in therapeutic cancer vaccines demonstrate that insect cell-derived antigens can offer several immunologic advantages over proteins derived from mammalian sources.","publish_time":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Betting, David J.; Mu, Xi Y.; Kafi, Kamran; McDonnel, Desmond; Rosas, Francisco; Gold, Daniel P.; Timmerman, John M.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cbb452e992c39733bf98350429a20f72bbea481.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b0db555d971c72130764dac9d89e7984d2a225b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2683685.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.10.055; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2683685?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08014412; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08014412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19000731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Id proteins","mammalian Id","Id-KLH","insect cells","insect cell-derived antigens","sources of recombinant Id protein tumor antigens","Recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cell-derived Id","higher levels of tumor","insect cell production","similar levels of tumor","tumor-specific immunoglobulin","mammalian cells","protein tumor antigen vaccines","native tumor antigen","tumor-myeloma hybridomas","characteristic of recombinant proteins","recombinant methods","mammalian sources","highest levels of anti-tumor immunity","specific antibodies","specific CD8","activation of human dendritic cells","therapeutic cancer vaccines","higher binding","Therapeutic vaccination of lymphoma patients","murine lymphoma","mannose receptors","carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin","terminal mannose residues","maleimide-based KLH conjugation","impairment","enhanced immunostimulatory properties","antibody responses","immunologic advantages","CTL","glycoslylation differences","bacteria","improved eradication of","idiotype","data","clinical investigation","immunogenicity"],"language":"en"},

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected. We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1\u00B705 \u00D7 10\u22122 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 \u00D7 10\u22124 to 2.72 \u00D7 10\u22122) for N, 5.34 \u00D7 10\u22123 (5.10 \u00D7 10\u22124, 1.28 \u00D7 10\u22122) for S, 1.69 \u00D7 10\u22123 (3.94 \u00D7 10\u22124, 3.60 \u00D7 10\u22123) for P, 1.65 \u00D7 10\u22123 (4.47 \u00D7 10\u22124, 3.24 \u00D7 10\u22123) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.

Alterations in proteolytic activity occur during pathological conditions such as cancer. One of the major deregulated classes of proteases in cancer is caspases, the proteolytic initiators and mediators of the apoptotic machinery. The ability to image apoptosis noninvasively in living cells and animal models of cancer can not only provide new insight into the biological basis of the disease but can also be used as a quantitative tool to screen and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. Optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence-based genetically engineered biosensors has been developed in our laboratory and exploited to study protease activity in animal models with a high signal to noise. Using the circularly permuted form of firefly luciferase, we have developed a reporter for Caspase 3/7, referred to as Caspase 3/7 GloSensor. Here, we discuss the use of the Caspase 3/7 GloSensor for imaging apoptotic activity in mouse xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and present the potential of this powerful platform technology to image the proteolytic activity of numerous other proteases.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pal, Anupama; Rehemtulla, Alnawaz","journal":"Proteases and Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c742b540b429e7f7d80ff16866f108d590adfc04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6435259.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-7595-2_22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29318559/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal models of cancer","proteolytic activity of numerous","engineered mouse models of cancer","imaging apoptotic activity","proteolytic initiators","study protease activity","GloSensor","regulated process of proteolytic processing","mouse xenografts","apoptotic machinery","biological basis","major deregulated classes of proteases","engineered biosensors","multiple biological functions","Optical molecular imaging","caspases","living cells","bioluminescence","mediators","potential","powerful platform technology","high signal","pathological conditions","addition","apoptosis","laboratory","new insight","non-specific degrading function","permuted form of firefly luciferase","novel therapeutic strategies","enzymes","protein-cleaving","noise","Alterations","quantitative tool","ability","disease","reporter"],"language":"en"},

The serum ACE2 levels on postoperative day 1 were divided into quartile categories. Results After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, current smoking status, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and tumour clinical stages, the risk of developing postoperative morbidities was significantly higher in the lowest serum ACE2 level quartile than in the highest quartile (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-6.23; p=0.008).

Yield from blood culture is low, but lung aspirate culture provides a higher diagnostic yield. We aimed to determine if diagnostic yield could be increased further by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b) and viruses in lung aspirate fluid. METHODS: A total of 95 children with radiological focal, lobar or segmental consolidation had lung aspirate performed and sent for bacterial culture and for PCR for detection of bacteria, viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii. In children with a pneumococcal aetiology, pneumococcal bacterial loads were calculated in blood and lung aspirate fluid. RESULTS: Blood culture identified a bacterial pathogen in only 8 patients (8%). With the addition of PCR on lung aspirate samples, causative pathogens (bacterial, viral, pneumocystis) were identified singly or as co-infections in 59 children (62%). The commonest bacterial organism was S.pneumoniae (41%), followed by H. influenzae b (6%), and the commonest virus identified was adenovirus (16%), followed by human bocavirus (HBoV) (4%), either as single or co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a select group of African children, lung aspirate PCR significantly improves diagnostic yield. Our study confirms a major role of S.pneumoniae and viruses in the aetiology of childhood pneumonia in Africa.","publish_time":"2011-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrol, Enitan D.; Mankhambo, Limangeni A.; Guiver, Malcolm; Banda, Daniel L.; Denis, Brigitte; Dove, Winifred; Jeffers, Graham; Molyneux, Elizabeth M.; Molyneux, Malcolm E.; Hart, C.

Rosenzweig, The paradox of enrichment, Science 171 (1971) 385\u2013387] is still a fundamental problem in ecology. Most of the solutions have been proposed at an individual species level of organization and solutions at community level are lacking. Knowledge of how learning and memory modify behavioral responses to species is a key factor in making a crucial link between species and community levels. PoE resolution via these two organizational levels can be interpreted as a microscopic- and macroscopic-level solution. Fractional derivatives provide an excellent tool for describing this memory and the hereditary properties of various materials and processes. The derivatives can be physically interpreted via two time scales that are considered simultaneously: the ideal, equably flowing homogeneous local time, and the cosmic (inhomogeneous) non-local time. Several mechanisms and theories have been proposed to resolve the PoE problem, but a universally accepted theory is still lacking because most studies have focused on local effects and ignored non-local effects, which capture memory. Here we formulate the fractional counterpart of the Rosenzweig model and analyze the stability behavior of a system. We conclude that there is a threshold for the memory effect parameter beyond which the Rosenzweig model is stable and may be used as a potential agent to resolve PoE from a new perspective via fractional differential equations.","publish_time":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rana, Sourav; Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi; Pal, Joydeep; N\u2019Gu\u00E9r\u00E9kata, Gaston M.; Chattopadhyay, Joydev","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d282f121c0eb838dc110a4b8389a7f948c93f2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127129.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711300294X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2013.03.061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288086/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037843711300294X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PoE","Rosenzweig"],"organizations":["Rosenzweig [M.

Here we describe a model designed to provide initial quantitative predictions of the risk of entry of such viruses to European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) through four routes: human travel, legal trade (e.g. fruit and animal products), live animal movements and illegal importation of bushmeat. The model utilises available datasets to assess the movement via these routes between individual countries of the world and EU MSs. These data are combined with virus specific data to assess the relative risk of entry between EU MSs. As a case study, the model was parameterised for NiV. Scenario analyses showed that the selection of exporting countries with NiV and potentially contaminated trade products were essential to the accuracy of all model outputs. Uncertainty analyses of other model parameters identified that the model expected number of years to an introduction event within the EU was highly susceptible to the prevalence of NiV in bats. The relative rankings of the MSs and routes, however, were more robust. The UK, the Netherlands and Germany were consistently the most likely points of entry and the ranking of most MSs varied by no more than three places (maximum variation five places). Legal trade was consistently the most likely route of entry, only falling below human travel when the estimate of the prevalence of NiV in bats was particularly low. Any model-based calculation is dependent on the data available to feed into the model and there are distinct gaps in our knowledge, particularly in regard to various pathogen/virus as well as host/bat characteristics. However, the strengths of this model lie in the provision of relative comparisons of risk among routes and MSs. The potential for expansion of the model to include other routes and viruses and the possibility of rapid parameterisation demonstrates its potential for use in an outbreak situation.","publish_time":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simons, Robin R.

Each year in the United States of America, influenza viruses are responsible for seasonal epidemics resulting in over 200,000 hospitalizations and 30,000\u201350,000 deaths. Accurate and early diagnosis of influenza viral infections are critical for rapid initiation of antiviral therapy to reduce influenza related morbidity and mortality both during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Several different approaches are currently available for diagnosis of influenza infections in humans. These include viral isolation in cell culture, immunofluorescence assays, nucleic acid amplification tests, immunochromatography-based rapid diagnostic tests, etc. Newer diagnostic approaches are being developed to overcome the limitations associated with some of the conventional detection methods. This review discusses diagnostic approaches currently available for detection of influenza viruses in humans.","publish_time":"2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vemula, Sai Vikram; Zhao, Jiangqin; Liu, Jikun; Wang, Xue; Biswas, Santanu; Hewlett, Indira","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d14e19f66d1a9c36b98aa2365aab80e9845616e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4848591.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v8040096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27077877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of influenza infections","detection of influenza viruses","influenza related morbidity","early diagnosis of influenza viral infections","rapid diagnostic tests","Newer diagnostic approaches","seasonal epidemics","different approaches","humans","viral isolation","nucleic acid amplification tests","conventional detection methods","rapid initiation of antiviral therapy","immunofluorescence assays","immunochromatography","cell culture","mortality","United States of America","vaccine","virus research","significant advancement","major public health concern","year","hospitalizations","pandemics","review","limitations","deaths"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be the pathogen responsible for a cluster of pneumonia cases associated with severe respiratory disease that occurred in December 2019 in China. This novel pulmonary infection, formally called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly in China and beyond. On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate. At present, chest-computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units. In this short communication, we present our experimental CXR scoring system that we are applying to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to quantify and monitor the severity and progression of this new infectious disease.

The flow shape of each breathing pattern was characterized by two angles and averaged values of 18 subjects. Two exhaled air velocities, u m and u p , were measured and compared. The mean peak centerline velocity, u m was found to decay correspondingly with increasing horizontal distance x in a form of power function. The mean propagation velocity, u p was found to correlate with physiological parameters of human subjects. This was always lower than u m at the mouth/nose opening, due to a vortex like airflow in front of a single exhalation cycle. When examining the talking and breathing process between two persons, the potential infectious risk was found to depend on their breathing patterns and spatial distribution of their exhaled air.

We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. METHODS: We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive RT-PCR sample for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, one tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored, including 73 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence in this cluster of one asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient, suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspect Covid-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danis, Kostas; Epaulard, Olivier; B\u00E9net, Thomas; Gaymard, Alexandre; Campoy, S\u00E9phora; Bothelo-Nevers, Elisabeth; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Spaccaferri, Guillaume; Ader, Florence; Mailles, Alexandra; Boudalaa, Zoubida; Tolsma, Violaine; Berra, Julien; Vaux, Sophie; Forestier, Emmanuel; Landelle, Caroline; Fougere, Erica; Thabuis, Alexandra; Berthelot, Philippe; Veil, Raphael; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Chidiac, Christian; Lina, Bruno; Coignard, Bruno; Saura, Christine","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/245319b9ff57c43cd0d2d027218c842a7c87ce3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277759/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore","England","France","Spain"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic case","index case","confirmed case of SARS","pediatric case","tertiary case","SARS-CoV","chalet","symptomatic patient","transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals","similar viral load","different schools","potential different transmission dynamics","interrupt transmission","secondary cases","French residents","French Alps","days","French Health authorities","close monitoring","close interactions","tested negative","infected child","positive endotracheal aspirate","lower respiratory tract results","positive RT-PCR sample","need","clinical evolution of suspect Covid","concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens","disease","family","influenza","cluster","dissociation","overall attack rate","coinfection","Spain","picornavirus","English tourists","children","coronavirus","England","investigation","occurrence","Englishman","person","Singapore","CONCLUSIONS","fact","France","contacts","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

To establish a productive infection in new host species, viruses must overcome barriers to replication mediated by diverse and rapidly evolving host restriction factors such as protein kinase R (PKR). Many viral antagonists of these restriction factors are species specific. For example, the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist, RhTRS1, inhibits PKR in some African green monkey (AGM) cells, but does not inhibit human or rhesus macaque PKR. To model the evolutionary changes necessary for cross-species transmission, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses RhTRS1 in a strain that lacks PKR inhibitors E3L and K3L (VV\u0394E\u0394K\u002BRhTRS1). Serially passaging VV\u0394E\u0394K\u002BRhTRS1 in minimally-permissive AGM cells increased viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Notably, adaptation in these AGM cells also improved virus replication 1000- to 10,000-fold in human and rhesus cells. Genetic analyses including deep sequencing revealed amplification of the rhtrs1 locus in the adapted viruses. Supplying additional rhtrs1 in trans confirmed that amplification alone was sufficient to improve VV\u0394E\u0394K\u002BRhTRS1 replication. Viruses with amplified rhtrs1 completely blocked AGM PKR, but only partially blocked human PKR, consistent with the replication properties of these viruses in AGM and human cells. Finally, in contrast to AGM-adapted viruses, which could be serially propagated in human cells, VV\u0394E\u0394K\u002BRhTRS1 yielded no progeny virus after only three passages in human cells. Thus, rhtrs1 amplification in a minimally permissive intermediate host was a necessary step, enabling expansion of the virus range to previously nonpermissive hosts. These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brennan, Greg; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Rothenburg, Stefan; Shendure, Jay; Geballe, Adam P.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d964ce1c8dd79290032b1b70d511f256b805e558.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3953438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626510/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AGM","AGM PKR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RhTRS1 replication","rhtrs1 amplification","human cells","virus replication","rhtrs1 locus","amplified rhtrs1","additional rhtrs1","blocked AGM PKR","viral replication","blocked human PKR","permissive AGM cells","rhesus cells","AGM-adapted viruses","new host species","efficient replication","replication properties","resistant host species","rhesus macaque PKR","rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist","PKR inhibitors E3L","species specific","cross-species transmission","permissive intermediate host","evolving host restriction factors","virus range","progeny virus","passaging VV\u0394E\u0394K","cross-species pathogen transmissions","necessary step","adaptations necessary","weak viral antagonist","evolutionary changes necessary","recombinant vaccinia virus","viral antagonists","fold","general evolutionary mechanism","protein kinase R","deep sequencing","African green monkey","humans","molecular foothold","strain","K3L","barriers","emerging infectious diseases","productive infection","Genetic analyses","animals","hypothesis","expansion","example","passages","majority","nonpermissive hosts","contrast","data"],"language":"en"},

These systems can be triggered by chemical compounds but also by cytokines, toll-like receptor ligands, nucleic acids, lipids, bacteria and viruses. Despite representing unique signaling cascades, new data indicate that the UPR and NF-\u03BAB pathways converge within the nucleus through ten major transcription factors (TFs), namely activating transcription factor (ATF)4, ATF3, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) homologous protein (CHOP), X-box-binding protein (XBP)1, ATF6\u03B1 and the five NF-\u03BAB subunits. The combinatorial occupancy of numerous genomic regions (enhancers and promoters) coordinates the transcriptional activation or repression of hundreds of genes that collectively determine the balance between metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes and the extent of apoptosis and autophagy or repair of cell damage and survival. Here, we also discuss results from genetic experiments and chemical activators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that suggest a link to the cytosolic inhibitor of NF-\u03BAB (I\u03BAB)\u03B1 degradation pathway. These data show that the UPR affects this major control point of NF-\u03BAB activation through several mechanisms. Taken together, available evidence indicates that the UPR and NF-\u03BAB interact at multiple levels. This crosstalk provides ample opportunities to fine-tune cellular stress responses and could also be exploited therapeutically in the future.","publish_time":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmitz, M.

Identifying the causative agent of a new epidemic is one of the most important steps for effective response to disease outbreaks. Traditionally, virus discovery required propagation of the virus in cell culture, a proven technique responsible for the identification of the vast majority of viruses known to date. However, many viruses cannot be easily propagated in cell culture, thus limiting our knowledge of viruses. Viral metagenomic analyses of environmental samples suggest that the field of virology has explored less than 1% of the extant viral diversity. In the last decade, the culture-independent and sequence-independent metagenomic approach has permitted the discovery of many viruses in a wide range of samples. Phylogenetically, some of these viruses are distantly related to previously discovered viruses. In addition, 60\u201399% of the sequences generated in different viral metagenomic studies are not homologous to known viruses. In this review, we discuss the advances in the area of viral metagenomics during the last decade and their relevance to virus discovery, clinical microbiology and public health. We discuss the potential of metagenomics for characterization of the normal viral population in a healthy community and identification of viruses that could pose a threat to humans through zoonosis. In addition, we propose a new model of the Koch\u0027s postulates named the \u2018Metagenomic Koch\u0027s Postulates\u2019. Unlike the original Koch\u0027s postulates and the Molecular Koch\u0027s postulates as formulated by Falkow, the metagenomic Koch\u0027s postulates focus on the identification of metagenomic traits in disease cases. The metagenomic traits that can be traced after healthy individuals have been exposed to the source of the suspected pathogen.","publish_time":"2012-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mokili, John L; Rohwer, Forest; Dutilh, Bas E","journal":"Curr Opin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62602a34f0a3a3a13b839eb27809dc1975c8c1dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102772.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2011.12.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625711001908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22440968/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625711001908","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of viruses","knowledge of viruses","discovered viruses","Metagenomic Koch\u0027s Postulates\u2019","different viral metagenomic studies","identification of metagenomic traits","Viral metagenomic analyses of environmental samples","Molecular Koch\u0027s postulates","original Koch\u0027s postulates","area of viral metagenomics","vast majority of viruses","virus discovery","normal viral population","spread of viral agents","re-emergence of viral diseases","extant viral diversity","sequence-independent metagenomic approach","culture-independent","cell culture","decade","addition","healthy community","effective response","disease outbreaks","disease cases","quick response","new epidemic","new model","potential of metagenomics","healthy individuals","wide range of samples","clinical microbiology","Falkow","proven technique responsible","adequate preparedness","important steps","characterization","relevance","goal","propagation","public health","advances","sequences","source","causative agent","threat","date","field of virology","suspected pathogen","humans","zoonosis","review"],"language":"en"},

Aim To investigate the burden, spectrum, risk factors, and impact of paediatric HCAI by prospective clinical surveillance at a South African referral hospital. Methods Continuous prospective clinical and laboratory HCAI surveillance using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions was conducted at Tygerberg Children\u0027s Hospital, South Africa, from May 1st to October 31st in 2014 and 2015. Risk factors for HCAI and associated mortality were analysed with multivariate logistic regression; excess length of stay was estimated using a confounder and time-matching approach. Findings HCAI incidence density was 31.1 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI: 28.2\u201334.2); hospital-acquired pneumonia (185/417; 44%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (45/417; 11%), bloodstream infection (BSI) (41/417; 10%), and surgical site infection (21/417; 5%) predominated. Device-associated HCAI incidence in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was high: 15.9, 12.9 and 16 per 1000 device-days for ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated BSI and catheter-associated UTI, respectively. HCAI was significantly associated with PICU stay (odds ratio: 2.0), malnutrition (1.6), HIV infection (1.7), HIV exposure (1.6), McCabe score \u2018fatal\u2019 (2.0), comorbidities (1.6), indwelling devices (1.9), blood transfusion (2.5), and transfer in (1.4). Two-thirds of paediatric deaths were HCAI-associated, occurring at a median of four days from HCAI onset with significantly higher crude mortality for HCAI-affected vs HCAI-unaffected hospitalizations [24/325 (7.4%) vs 12/1022 (1.2%); P \u003C0.001]. HCAI resulted in US$371,887 direct costs with an additional 2275 hospitalization days, 2365 antimicrobial days, and 3575 laboratory investigations. Conclusion HCAI was frequent with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Establishment of HCAI surveillance and prevention programmes for African children is a public health priority.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dramowski, A.; Whitelaw, A.; Cotton, M.

Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target-template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds.

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are recognized as having significant social, economic and ecological costs, threatening human health, food security, wildlife conservation and biodiversity. We review the processes underlying the emergence of infectious disease, focusing on the similarities and differences between conceptual models of disease emergence and biological invasions in general. 2. Study of the IUCN\u0027s list of the world\u0027s worst invaders reveals that disease is cited as a driver behind the conservation, medical or economic impact of nearly a quarter of the species on the data base. 3. The emergence of novel diseases in new host species are, in essence, examples of invasions by parasites. Many of the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence and classical invasions are also shared, with environmental change and global transport providing opportunities for the introduction and spread of invaders and novel parasites. 4. The phases of disease emergence and biological invasions have many parallels; particularly the early and late phases, where demographic and anthropogenic factors are key drivers. However, there are also differences in the intermediate phases, where host\u2013parasite co\u2010evolution plays a crucial role in determining parasite establishment in novel hosts. 5. Similar opportunities and constraints on control and management occur at the different phases of invasions and disease emergence. However, exploitation of host immune responses offers additional control opportunities through contact control and vaccination against EIDs. We propose that cross\u2010fertilization between the disciplines of disease emergence and invasion biology may provide further insights into their prediction, control and management.","publish_time":"2012-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatcher, Melanie J.; Dick, Jaimie T.

This study assessed the viral quality of the Umgeni River in South Africa seasonally. A two\u2010step tangential flow filtration process was setup to remove the bacteria and to concentrate the virus populations from large volume water samples. The concentrated water samples contained up to 659 and 550 pfu/mL of somatic and F\u2010RNA coliphages, respectively. Several virus families including Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae and Reoviridae were found in the river based on the morphologies examined under transmission electron microscopy. All concentrated water samples produced substantial cytopathic effects on the Vero, HEK 293, Hela and A549 cell lines. These results indicate the potential of viruses in the water samples especially from the lower catchment areas of the Umgeni River to infect human hosts throughout the year.

Influenza surveillance systems are widely used around the world and play an important role in influenza epidemic prevention and control. METHODS: As a theater centers for disease prevention and control, we established an influenza monitoring platform (IMP) in 2014 to strengthen the monitoring of influenza-like illness and influenza virus infection. In this study, we introduced the constitution, influenza virus detection, and quality control for an IMP. The monitoring effect was also evaluated by comparing the monitoring data with data from national influenza surveillance systems. The experiences and problems associated with the platform also were summarized. RESULTS: A theater IMP was established based on 3 levels of medical units, including monitoring sites, testing laboratories and a checking laboratory. A series of measures were taken to guarantee the quality of monitoring, such as technical training, a unified process, sufficient supervision and timely communication. The platform has run smoothly for 3 monitoring years to date. In the 2014\u20132015 and 2016\u20132017 monitoring years, sample amount coincided with that obtained from the National Influenza Surveillance program. In the 2015\u20132016 monitoring year, due to the strict prevention and control measures, an influenza epidemic peak was avoided in monitoring units, and the monitoring data did not coincide with that of the National Influenza Surveillance program. Several problems, including insufficient attention, unreasonable administrative intervention or subordination relationships, and the necessity of detection in monitoring sites were still observed. CONCLUSIONS: A theater IMP was established rationally and played a deserved role in the prevention and control of influenza. However, several problems remain to be solved.","publish_time":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jian; Yang, Hui-Suo; Deng, Bing; Shi, Meng-Jing; Li, Xiang-Da; Nian, Qing-Gong; Song, Wen-Jing; Bing, Feng; Li, Qing-Feng","journal":"Mil Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/899c5959f51505b0935e46c2e77129156026806e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5694910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29502518/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-017-0144-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Influenza Surveillance"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monitoring of influenza","influenza monitoring platform","control of influenza","monitoring data","monitoring units","monitoring sites","quality of monitoring","monitoring years","monitoring effect","influenza epidemic prevention","influenza virus detection","national influenza surveillance systems","National Influenza Surveillance program","influenza epidemic peak","influenza virus infection","control measures","quality control","theater IMP","disease prevention","problems","strict prevention","theater centers","military training","technical training","necessity of detection","important role","deserved role","series of measures","levels of medical units","acute respiratory infectious disease","high incidence rate","unified process","unreasonable administrative intervention","subordination relationships","sufficient supervision","Chinese army","insufficient attention","testing laboratories","illness","timely communication","constitution","checking laboratory","soldiers\u2019 health","world","BACKGROUND","METHODS","experiences","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","date","sample","study"],"language":"en"},

This chapter describes the nature and modern treatment of waste water, land applications of waste water, and methods of land applications of biosolids and animal wastes. The amount of organic matter in domestic wastes determines the degree of required biological treatment. Various tests are used to assess the amount of organic matter: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). The complete sewage treatment comprises three major steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. Tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in reducing the concentration of pathogens. The treated domestic wastewater may be disposed of via land application for crop irrigation or as a means of additional treatment and disposal through the three basic methods that include low-rate irrigation, overland flow, and high-rate infiltration.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.","journal":"Environmental Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fa172d7d037fa67feb25a999d9afceed6aa4e64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171382.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123705198000249; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123705198000249","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biological treatment","Tertiary treatment processes","modern treatment of waste water","primary goal of wastewater treatment","means of additional treatment","complete sewage treatment","degradation of organic matter","land applications of waste water","methods of land applications of biosolids","total organic carbon","domestic wastes","biochemical oxygen demand","low-rate irrigation","treated domestic wastewater","basic methods","crop irrigation","physicochemical processes","animal wastes","high-rate infiltration","BOD","overland flow","major steps","COD","removal","disposal","nature","degree","Publisher Summary","controlled conditions","TOC","chapter","concentration of pathogens","Various tests"],"language":"en"},

We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions. Patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts. The chi-square test, Student\u2019s t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups. Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression. Diagnostic efficacies of developed models were quantified by receiver operating characteristic curve. Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram. RESULTS: Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different. Besides ground-glass opacities (p = 0.032) and consolidation (p = 0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1\u20133 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.027). Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417). Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000). The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Current vaccines have failed to completely prevent PRRS outbreaks. Recently, we have shown that poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine (NP-KAg) induces a cross-protective immune response in pigs. To further improve its cross-protective efficacy, the NP-KAg vaccine formulation was slightly modified, and pigs were coadministered the vaccine twice intranasally with a potent adjuvant: Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole-cell lysate. In vaccinated virulent heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs, the immune correlates in the blood were as follows: 1) enhanced PRRSV-specific antibody response with enhanced avidity of both immunoglobulin (Ig)-G and IgA isotypes, associated with augmented virus-neutralizing antibody titers; 2) comparable and increased levels of virus-specific IgG(1) and IgG(2) antibody subtypes and production of high levels of both T-helper (Th)-1 and Th2 cytokines, indicative of a balanced Th1\u2013Th2 response; 3) suppressed immunosuppressive cytokine response; 4) increased frequency of interferon-\u03B3(\u002B) lymphocyte subsets and expanded population of antigen-presenting cells; and most importantly 5) complete clearance of detectable replicating challenged heterologous PRRSV and close to threefold reduction in viral ribonucleic acid load detected in the blood. In conclusion, intranasal delivery of adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine formulation to growing pigs elicited a broadly cross-protective immune response, showing the potential of this innovative vaccination strategy to prevent PRRS outbreaks in pigs.

Cardiologists need to be better prepared regarding standard disinfection procedures, and be aware of the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and its use in the critical care setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sugimoto, Tadafumi; Mizuno, Atsushi; Kishi, Takuya; Ito, Naoya; Matsumoto, Chisa; Fukuda, Memori; Kagiyama, Nobuyuki; Shibata, Tatsuhiro; Ohmori, Takashi; Oishi, Shogo; Fuse, Jun; Kida, Keisuke; Kawai, Fujimi; Ishida, Mari; Sanada, Shoji; Komuro, Issei; Node, Koichi","journal":"Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.cj-20-0302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cardiologists","chief manifestations of COVID","important aspects of COVID","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","coronavirus disease","infected patients","cardiovascular disease","use","healthcare providers","departments","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","hospitals","collaboration","treatments","regular update of information","essentials","SARS-CoV","increasing attention","indications","relationship","systematic review","critical care setting","Methods","Results","standard disinfection procedures","Protection","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The amplified materials were pooled and processed using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The raw sequences were deconvoluted on the basis of the barcode and then processed through a standardized bioinformatics pipeline. The unique reads (348, 70 and 13) had limited similarity to known astroviruses, bocaviruses and parechoviruses. Specific primers were synthesized to assess the prevalence of the viruses in healthy piglets. Our results indicate extremely high rates of positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Several novel astroviruses, bocaviruses and Ljungan-like viruses were identified in stool samples from healthy pigs. The rates of isolation for the new viruses were high.

Epidemics usually occur when health systems are unprepared. During an unexpected epidemic, health authorities engage in damage control, fear drives action, and the desire to understand the threat is greatest. As humanity recovers, policy-makers seek scientific expertise to improve their \u201Cpreparedness\u201D to face future events. Global spread of disease is exemplified by the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, by the spread of dengue fever through transcontinental migration of mosquitos, by the relentless influenza virus pandemics, and, most recently, by the unexpected emergence of Ebola virus, spread by motorbike and long haul carriers. Other pathogens that are remarkable for their epidemic expansions include the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus diseases carried by rodents over great geographic distances and the arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya and Zika) enabled by ecology and vector adaptations. Did we learn from the past epidemics? Are we prepared for the worst? The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global health infrastructure. Besides acquiring treatments, vaccines, and other preventive medicine, bio-surveillance is critical to preventing disease emergence and to counteracting its spread. So far, only the western hemisphere has a large and established monitoring system; however, diseases continue to emerge sporadically, in particular in Southeast Asia and South America, illuminating the imperfections of our surveillance. Epidemics destabilize fragile governments, ravage the most vulnerable populations, and threaten the global community. Pandemic risk calculations employ new technologies like computerized maintenance of geographical and historical datasets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Next Generation sequencing, and Metagenomics to trace the molecular changes in pathogens during their emergence, and mathematical models to assess risk. Predictions help to pinpoint the hot spots of emergence, the populations at risk, and the pathogens under genetic evolution. Preparedness anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the capacities of infrastructure, the sources of emergency funding, and finally, the international partnerships needed to manage a disaster before it occurs. At present, the world is in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health disparities despite exponential population growth, political conflicts, migration, global trade, urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming. For the sake of humanity, we must focus on developing the necessary capacities for health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response.","publish_time":"2017-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez, Jean-Paul; Souris, Marc; Valdivia-Granda, Willy","journal":"Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/127f079e09edd16fc527d618396763265d9c2ec2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986822/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6981-4_1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Geographic Information Systems"],"locations":["Africa","West Nile","Southeast Asia","South America"],"keyphrases":["health surveillance","Global spread of disease","health systems","disease emergence","global community","resilient global health infrastructure","epidemic preparedness","health disparities","health authorities","global trade","global warming","pathogens","spread of dengue fever","spread of yellow fever","unexpected epidemic","unexpected emergence of Ebola virus","successive epidemics","past epidemics","hot spots of emergence","epidemic expansions","hantavirus diseases","bio-surveillance","capacities of infrastructure","Pandemic risk calculations","world","scientific community","Geographic Information Systems","transmission of communicable diseases","molecular changes","vulnerable populations","necessary capacities","scientific expertise","pandemic response","humanity recovers","sake of humanity","transcontinental migration of mosquitos","exponential population growth","great geographic distances","major environmental changes","relentless influenza virus pandemics","computerized maintenance of geographical","historical datasets","political conflicts","new technologies","damage control","arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers","arthropod","GIS","rodents","urbanization","fear drives action","desire","South America","Zika","chikungunya","West Nile","viruses","motorbike","preventive medicine","established monitoring system","policy-makers","Americas","ecology","Southeast Asia","Metagenomics","Africa","needs","sources of emergency funding","western hemisphere","Generation sequencing","fragile governments","intermediate phase","long haul carriers","mathematical models","vaccines","imperfections","risks","international partnerships","vector adaptations","ultimate goal","genetic evolution","disaster","threat","treatments","Predictions","future events","present","worst"],"language":"en"},

The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in the management of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1\u20132 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at four consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.

A continuous surveillance of 16 respiratory viruses was conducted from November 2010 to October 2011 of outpatients with influenza\u2010like illness in Nanjing, China. The two largest general hospitals and a provincial virus laboratory in Nanjing participated in this study. Throat swabs were collected from outpatients during medical visits for influenza\u2010like illness and were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using PCR. Three hundred seventeen viruses were detected in samples from 246 (50.6%) patients with influenza\u2010like illness. The viruses found mostly commonly were influenza, rhinovirus, hCoV HKU1, and adenovirus. The identification rates of respiratory viruses differed significantly among different sampling seasons (P = 0.0002). The rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were much higher during the influenza\u2010like illness winter peak than during the influenza\u2010like illness summer peak and other months. Co\u2010infections were detected in 57 (11.7%) patients and were found most commonly in adults older than 60 years. RSV was detected in 5.9% and 2.6% of patients who were 0\u20135 and 6\u201315 years old, respectively, but was not detected in other age groups. This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the population and account for a large proportion of influenza\u2010like illness.

However, the recently emerged coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) is the most pathogenic human coronavirus discovered to date. The SARS-CoV spike (S) protein mediates virus entry by binding cellular receptors and inducing fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane. Coronavirus S proteins are palmitoylated, which may affect function. Here, we created a non-palmitoylated SARS-CoV S protein by mutating all nine cytoplasmic cysteine residues. Palmitoylation of SARS-CoV S was required for partitioning into detergent-resistant membranes and for cell\u2013cell fusion. Surprisingly, however, palmitoylation of S was not required for interaction with SARS-CoV M protein. This contrasts with the requirement for palmitoylation of mouse hepatitis virus S protein for interaction with M protein and may point to important differences in assembly and infectivity of these two coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2010-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"McBride, Corrin E.; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/717dd42addf863934e0fc3d70800886cd0a76663.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2914208.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210003752; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210003752; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.05.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20580052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-palmitoylated SARS-CoV S protein","Palmitoylation of SARS","SARS-CoV spike","Coronavirus S proteins","palmitoylation of mouse hepatitis virus S protein","cell fusion","interaction","emerged coronavirus","host cell membrane","pathogenic human coronavirus","virus entry","Abstract Coronaviruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome","enveloped RNA viruses","viral envelope","detergent-resistant membranes","requirement","cellular receptors","partitioning","mild disease","assembly","infectivity","important differences","date","cytoplasmic cysteine residues","humans","contrasts","function"],"language":"en"},

While human convalescent sera may not be readily available in the early stages of an outbreak, antisera of animal origin can be produced in a short time frame. Here, we compared adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLP) with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), both expressing the Ebola virus antigens. The neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted VLPs were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent VSV, indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies. This approach also yielded high-titer antisera against Nipah virus glycoproteins, illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families. Multiple-step immunoglobulin G purification using a two-step 20\u201340% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability.

Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM10; aerodynamic diameter \u003C10 \u03BCm) and fine (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter \u003C2.5 \u03BCm) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments. In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings. It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amoatey, Patrick; Omidvarborna, Hamid; Baawain, Mahad Said; Al-Mamun, Abdullah","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c0a27f01b3e045dd8aebb1c99e39d35afc7d82e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416534/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139356; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720328734; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720328734?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["public buildings","virus transmissions","virus droplets","residential buildings","indoor environments","indoor air temperatures","potential factor of virus","arid Middle Eastern countries","habitual indoor burning of incense","\u03BCm","aerodynamic diameter","SARS-CoV","Abstract Majority of countries","spread","role of poor indoor environmental conditions","building ventilation","transmission of SARS","residential homes","relevant public health agencies","mechanical ventilation systems","overconsumption of air conditioning","harsh ambient climatic conditions","hot climate","elevated outdoor temperature","humidity levels","PM10","social distancing","disinfections","quarantine","major source of coarse","globe","particles","general measure","particulate matters","future viral outbreak","control measures","PM2","inhalation","different situation","wearing of masks"],"language":"en"},

In the gammaretroviruses, typified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gag and pol are in the same reading frame, separated by a UAG stop codon, and termination codon readthrough is required for expression of the viral Gag-Pol fusion protein. Here, we investigated the effect on MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency. We began by manipulating the readthrough signal in the context of an infectious viral clone to generate a series of MuLV variants in which readthrough was stimulated or reduced. In carefully controlled infectivity assays, it was found that reducing the MuLV readthrough efficiency only 4-fold led to a marked defect and that a 10-fold reduction essentially abolished replication. However, up to an \u223C8.5-fold stimulation of readthrough (up to 60% readthrough) was well tolerated by the virus. These high levels of readthrough were achieved using a two-plasmid system, with Gag and Gag-Pol expressed from separate infectious clones. We also modulated readthrough by silencing expression of eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) or by introducing aminoglycosides into the cells. The data obtained indicate that gammaretroviruses tolerate a substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis but are very sensitive to a reduction in levels of this polyprotein. Thus, as is also the case for ribosomal frameshifting, antiviral therapies targeting readthrough with inhibitory agents are likely to be the most beneficial. IMPORTANCE Many pathogenic RNA viruses and retroviruses use ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough to regulate expression of their replicase enzymes. These translational \u201Crecoding\u201D processes are potential targets for antiviral intervention, but we have only a limited understanding of the consequences to virus replication of modulating the efficiency of recoding, particularly for those viruses employing readthrough. In this paper, we describe the first systematic analysis of the effect of increasing or decreasing readthrough efficiency on virus replication using the gammaretrovirus MuLV as a model system. We find unexpectedly that MuLV replication is only slightly inhibited by substantial increases in readthrough frequency, but as with other viruses that use recoding strategies, replication is quite sensitive to even modest reductions. These studies provide insights into both the readthrough process and MuLV replication and have implications for the selection of antivirals against gammaretroviruses.","publish_time":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Csibra, Eszter; Brierley, Ian; Irigoyen, Nerea","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27b5819a442f4af88897625612d73a398b439bfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4178896.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991001/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00898-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moloney"],"organizations":["UAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MuLV readthrough efficiency","Translational readthrough","readthrough process","readthrough frequency","readthrough signal","MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency","termination codon readthrough","fold stimulation of readthrough","high levels of readthrough","virus replication","replication cycles","gammaretrovirus MuLV","efficiency of recoding","stop codon","series of MuLV variants","gammaretroviruses","viral Gag-Pol fusion protein","substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis","antiviral intervention","fold reduction","ribosomal frameshifting","antiviral therapies","infectious viral clone","pathogenic RNA viruses","effect","recoding strategies","Moloney murine leukemia virus","potential targets","suppression of termination","substantial increases","model system","plasmid system","silencing expression of eukaryotic release factors","separate infectious clones","processes","inhibitory agents","UAG","implications","context","IMPORTANCE","consequences","selection of antivirals","limited understanding","eRF1","reading frame","insights","systematic analysis","modest reductions","marked defect","replicase enzymes","aminoglycosides","controlled infectivity assays","eRF3","polyprotein","studies","cells","paper","data"],"language":"en"},

The rhesus macaque is the only known disease model for MERS-CoV, developing an acute localized-to-widespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease(2,3) that recapitulates mild-to-moderate human MERS-CoV cases(4,5). The combination of interferon-\u03B12b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro(6); therefore, this strategy was initiated 8 h post-infection in the rhesus macaque model. Treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no-to-very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed reduced levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers in addition to reduced viral genome copies, altered gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs.

Therefore, these cellular proteases are putative targets for the development of antivirals that inhibit their activity. Host proteases have been described to play essential roles in Ebola, HCV, HIV and influenza, such that specific protease inhibitors are able to reduce infection. RSV utilizes a host protease in its replication cycle but its potential as antiviral target is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of protease inhibitors on RSV infection. METHODS: To measure the sensitivity of RSV infection to protease inhibitors, cells were infected with RSV and incubated for 18 h in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. Cells were fixed, stained and studied using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Several protease inhibitors, representing different classes of proteases (AEBSF, Pepstatin A, E-64, TPCK, PMSF and aprotinin), were tested for inhibitory effects on an RSV A2 infection of HEp-2 cells. Different treatment durations, ranging from 1 h prior to inoculation and continuing for 18 h during the assay, were evaluated. Of all the inhibitors tested, AEBSF and TPCK significantly decreased RSV infection. To ascertain that the observed effect of AEBSF was not a specific feature related to HEp-2 cells, A549 and BEAS-2B cells were also used. Similar to HEp-2, an almost complete block in the number of RSV infected cells after 18 h of incubation was observed and the effect was dose-dependent. To gain insight into the mechanism of this inhibition, AEBSF treatment was applied during different phases of an infection cycle (pre-, peri- and post-inoculation treatment). The results from these experiments indicate that AEBSF is mainly active during the early entry phase of RSV. The inhibitory effect was also observed with other RSV isolates A1998/3\u20132 and A2000/3\u20134, suggesting that this is a general feature of RSV. CONCLUSION: RSV infection can be inhibited by broad serine protease inhibitors, AEBSF and TPCK. We confirmed that AEBSF inhibition is independent of the cell line used or RSV strain. The time point at which treatment with the inhibitor was most potent, was found to coincide with the expected moment of entry of the virion with the host cell.","publish_time":"2017-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van der Gucht, Winke; Leemans, Annelies; De Schryver, Marjorie; Heykers, Annick; Caljon, Guy; Maes, Louis; Cos, Paul; Delputte, Peter L.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a789bc7f1713d549288d3effb72ff34cd3b0ab0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5561636.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818113/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0824-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","TPCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitivity of RSV infection","RSV strain","RSV A2 infection of HEp","effect of protease inhibitors","AEBSF treatment","number of RSV infected cells","specific protease inhibitors","general feature of RSV","RSV isolates A1998","observed effect of AEBSF","infection cycle","AEBSF inhibition","early entry phase of RSV","Host proteases","broad serine protease inhibitors","B cells","TPCK","host cell","different classes of proteases","Different treatment durations","cellular proteases","h of incubation","post-inoculation treatment","different phases","specific feature","RESULTS","expected moment of entry","viral activities","replication cycle","cell line","essential roles","important roles","inhibitory effects","viral protein production","uncoating","influenza","potential","Ebola","HCV","putative targets","HIV","virion","A549","development of antivirals","antiviral target","disease induction","complete block","Pepstatin","BEAS","mechanism","PMSF","aprotinin","experiments","presence","absence","time point","fluorescence microscopy","activity","insight","dose-dependent","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","A2000","METHODS","assay"],"language":"en"},

Conclusion The use of corticosteroids in SARS has been debated; opinions conflict about whether the immediate benefits in terms of saving lives compensate for the adverse effects, including AVN.","publish_time":"2009-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Hui; De Vlas, Sake J.; Liu, Wei; Wang, Tian\u2010Bao; Cao, Zhao\u2010Yang; Li, Chun\u2010Peng; Cao, Wu\u2010Chun; Richardus, Jan Hendrik","journal":"Trop Med Int Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47998ce47866b5151aea13d028c6f8e32936c96d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169846.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508438/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02187.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","AVN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of AVN","SARS patients","cases of hip necrosis","use of corticosteroids","years of observation","total dose of corticosteroids","months","post\u2010SARS follow\u2010up assessments","X\u2010rays of hips","corticosteroid treatment","observation time","severe acute respiratory syndrome","lives","immediate benefits","MRI","knees","shoulders","avascular osteonecrosis","ankles","opinions conflict","relationship","health care workers","Magnetic resonance images","Methods Longitudinal study","wrists","terms","cent","Conclusion","sole factor","cohort","adverse effects","Objective","Results","joints"],"language":"en"},

Several studies have been done to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date. Methods In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. Results We estimated that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in Wuhan.

The velocity of respiratory flow was scaled using similarity laws between air and water. Breath simulation was performed via a computer-controlled piston-cylinder system. Food-dye visualization allows a qualitative analysis of the re-inhaled fraction of this exhaled flow. For the quantitative analysis, neutrally buoyant particles were added to the water medium, and illuminated by the laser which illuminates the whole breathing region of the respiratory model, such that the trajectory and quantity of the re-inhaled particles can be recorded and counted. The experimental results in the pediatric airway replica show that a negligible fraction (\u003C0.06%) of the exhaled airflow is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing in the absence of the rising thermal plume. The artificial plume generated by a heated aluminium brick at the tank bottom increases the re-inhalation ratio by 4 times under the investigated case (albeit still at a very low value of 0.15%).

We report here the X-ray structures of the syn1 and syn2 transmembrane subunit ectodomains, featuring a 6-helix bundle (6HB) typical of the post-fusion state of gamma-retrovirus and filovirus fusion proteins. Contrary to the filoviruses, for which the fusion glycoprotein was crystallized both in the post-fusion and in the spring-loaded pre-fusion form, the highly unstable nature of the syncytins\u0027 prefusion form has precluded structural studies. We undertook a proline-scanning approach searching for regions in the syn1 6HB central helix that tolerate the introduction of helix-breaker residues and still fold correctly in the pre-fusion form. We found that there is indeed such a region, located two \u03B1-helical turns downstream a stutter in the central coiled-coil helix - precisely where the breaks of the spring-loaded helix of the filoviruses map. These mutants were fusion-inactive as they cannot form the 6HB, similar to the \u201CSOSIP\u201D mutant of HIV Env that allowed the high-resolution structural characterization of its labile pre-fusion form.

However, a large difference in HA incidence between Canada and HA-endemic countries has made travel an important contributor to hepatitis A prevalence in Canada. There is also a (smaller) incidence differential between Canada and the US. Although the US has only moderately higher HA incidence, the volume of travel by Canadians to the US is many times higher than travel volume to endemic countries. Hence, travel to the US may constitute a source of low to moderate risk for Canadian travelers. To our knowledge, travel to the US has never been included as a potential risk factor for HA infection in Canadian epidemiologic analyses. The objective of this study was to use dynamic models to investigate the possible effects on hepatitis A incidence in Canada due to (1) implementing vaccination in the US, and (2) varying the volume of travel by Canadians to the US. METHODS: We developed and analyzed age-structured compartmental models for the transmission and vaccination of hepatitis A, for both Canada and the US. Models were parameterized using data on seroprevalence, case reporting, and travel patterns. The potential effect of hepatitis A prevalence in the US on hepatitis A prevalence in Canada was captured through a term representing infection of Canadians due to travel in the US. RESULTS: The model suggests that approximately 22% of HA cases in Canada in the mid 1990s may have been attributable to travel to the US. A universal vaccination programme that attained 70% coverage in young children in the US in the mid 1990s could have reduced Canadian incidence by 21% within 5 years. CONCLUSION: Since not all necessary data were available to parameterize the model, the results should be considered exploratory. However, the analysis shows that, under plausible assumptions, the US may be more important for determining HA prevalence in Canada than is currently supposed. As international travel continues to grow, making vaccination policies ever more relevant to populations beyond a country\u0027s borders, such multi-country models will most likely come into wider use as predictive aids for policy development.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amariei, Raluca; Willms, Allan R; Bauch, Chris T","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f40d65d9dcb0b71bd266e62f77bc51d4c449eed1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2292190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18307785/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-8-23","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US","HA"],"locations":["United States","Canada"],"keyphrases":["Canada","volume of travel","travel volume","HA prevalence","travel patterns","international travel","higher HA incidence","vaccination of hepatitis","HA infection","Canadian incidence","low-incidence","HA-endemic countries","HA cases","incidence differential","potential effect of hepatitis","dynamic models","infection of Canadians","vaccination policies","Canadian travelers","multi-country models","universal vaccination programme","RESULTS","age-structured compartmental models","non-endemic disease","potential risk factor","Canadian epidemiologic analyses","times higher","moderate risk","source of low","important contributor","necessary data","wider use","country\u0027s borders","possible effects","predictive aids","populations","case reporting","coverage","seroprevalence","transmission","policy development","United States","large difference","young children","study","plausible assumptions","term","analysis","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","knowledge","objective","METHODS","years"],"language":"en"},

They do so through concerted action of distinct receptor-binding (\u201Clectin\u201D) and receptor-destroying sialate O-acetylesterase (\u201Desterase\u201D) domains. Most HEs target 9-O-acetylated Sias. In one lineage of murine coronaviruses, however, HE esterase substrate and lectin ligand specificity changed dramatically as these viruses evolved to use 4-O-acetylated Sias instead. Here we present the crystal structure of the lectin domain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain S HE, resolved both in its native state and in complex with a receptor analogue. The data show that the shift from 9-O- to 4-O-Ac-Sia receptor usage primarily entailed a change in ligand binding topology and, surprisingly, only modest changes in receptor-binding site architecture. Our findings illustrate the ease with which viruses can change receptor-binding specificity with potential consequences for host-, organ and/or cell tropism, and for pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2012-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langereis, Martijn A.; Zeng, Qinghong; Heesters, Balthasar; Huizinga, Eric G.; de Groot, Raoul J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/007bf75961da42a7e0cc8e2855e5c208a5ec65c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3266934.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetylated Sias","receptor-binding specificity","receptor analogue","O-acetylated sialic acids","receptor-binding site architecture","sialate O-acetylesterase","Sia receptor usage","concerted action of distinct receptor-binding","lectin ligand specificity","ligand binding topology","esterase substrate","HEs target","lectin domain of mouse hepatitis virus","reversible virion attachment","MHV","potential consequences","organ","toro","orthomyxoviruses","envelope glycoproteins of corona","host","modest changes","strain S","complex","crystal structure","cell tropism","lineage of murine coronaviruses","hemagglutinin-esterases","ease","native state","pathogenesis","findings","domains","shift","data"],"language":"en"},

It has also been shown that the influenza A virus can be transmitted to mammalian species such as tigers and domestic cats and dogs through ingestion of infected birds. Another group of animals that should also be considered as potential hosts for the influenza A virus are the crocodilians. Many crocodilian species share aquatic environments with wild birds that are known to harbor influenza viruses. In addition, many large crocodilians utilize birds as a significant food source. Given these factors in addition to the close taxonomic proximity of aves to the crocodilians, it is feasible to ask whether crocodilian species may also harbor the influenza A virus. Here we analyzed 37 captive crocodilians from two locations in Florida (plus 5 wild bird fecal\u2010samples from their habitat) to detect the presence of influenza A virus. Several sample types were examined. Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR tests targeting the influenza A matrix gene were positive for four individual crocodilians\u2014Alligator sinensis, Paleosuchus trigonatus, Caiman latirostris and Crocodylus niloticus. Of the seven serum samples tested with the avian influenza virus agar gel immunodiffusion assay, three showed a nonspecific reaction to the avian influenza virus antigen\u2014A. sinensis, P. trigonatus and C. niloticus (C. latirostris was not tested).

Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) is used increasingly to diagnose respiratory infections and has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. Objective of the present study was to develop a one-step mRT-PCR that could detect 18 respiratory viruses in three sets. The method was compared with real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for its sensitivity and specificity. Clinical specimens from 843 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms were used in the study. 503 (59.7%) samples were detected positive by mRT-PCR. Of these 462 (54.8%) exhibited presence of a single pathogen and 41 (4.9%) had multiple pathogens. rRT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples, where 419 (49.7%) exhibited one virus and 20 (2.4%) showed co-infections. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rRT-PCR was 91.9% and kappa correlation 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% while that of rRT-PCR was 86.9% and 99.4% respectively. Rhinovirus (17.2%) was the most frequently detected virus followed by respiratory syncytial virus B (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 (8.54%), parainfluenza virus-3 (5.8%) and metapneumovirus (5.2%). In conclusion, mRT-PCR is a rapid, cost effective, specific and highly sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2013-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choudhary, Manohar L.; Anand, Siddharth P.; Heydari, Mostafa; Rane, Grishma; Potdar, Varsha A.; Chadha, Mandeep S.; Mishra, Akhilesh C.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d5f0773a3e949292d246854d7532ef2885ebdba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119668.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313883/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.12.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413000049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413000049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rRT-PCR","one-step mRT-PCR","specificity of mRT","respiratory symptoms","real time RT-PCR","detected virus","detection of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus B","accurate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections","parainfluenza virus","sensitive method","sensitivity","co-infections","positive samples","viral culture","antigen detection","present study","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","pediatric patients","patient management","Clinical specimens","Concordance","presence","single pathogen","H1N1pdm09","Objective","kappa correlation","sets","conclusion","multiple pathogens","Rhinovirus","metapneumovirus"],"language":"en"},

We previously reported the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain BH10 by human IFITM1, 2 and 3. It is unknown whether other HIV-1 strains are similarly inhibited by IFITMs and whether there exists viral countermeasure to overcome IFITM inhibition. We report here that the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain (HIV-1(NL4-3)) is not restricted by IFITM1 and its viral envelope glycoprotein is partly responsible for this insensitivity. However, HIV-1(NL4-3) is profoundly inhibited by an IFITM1 mutant, known as \u0394(117\u2013125), which is deleted of 9 amino acids at the C-terminus. In contrast to the wild type IFITM1, which does not affect HIV-1 entry, the \u0394(117\u2013125) mutant diminishes HIV-1(NL4-3) entry by 3-fold. This inhibition correlates with the predominant localization of \u0394(117\u2013125) to the plasma membrane where HIV-1 entry occurs. In spite of strong conservation of IFITM1 among most species, mouse IFITM1 is 19 amino acids shorter at its C-terminus as compared to human IFITM1 and, like the human IFITM1 mutant \u0394(117\u2013125), mouse IFITM1 also inhibits HIV-1 entry. This is the first report illustrating the role of viral envelope protein in overcoming IFITM1 restriction. The results also demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal region of IFITM1 in modulating the antiviral function through controlling protein subcellular localization.","publish_time":"2015-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Rui; Ding, Shilei; Pan, Qinghua; Liu, Shan-Lu; Qiao, Wentao; Liang, Chen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f02529d9be6c7576b60d295c4e04d15a9a432614.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4349745.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738301/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118794","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV","mouse IFITM1","human IFITM1 mutant \u0394","wild type IFITM1","overcoming IFITM1 restriction","C-terminal region of IFITM1","entry","NL4","spite of strong conservation of IFITM1","C-terminus","IFITM inhibition","predominant localization of \u0394","inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type","role of viral envelope protein","viral envelope glycoprotein","viral countermeasure","inhibition correlates","report","amino acids shorter","controlling protein subcellular localization","strain BH10","antiviral function","proteins","species","importance","wide range of viruses","interferon-inducible transmembrane","IFITMs","strains","contrast","plasma membrane","insensitivity","results","fold"],"language":"en"},

The full-length genome of ZJQ-221 was found to be 15,246 nucleotides and consisted of seven non-overlapping genes encoding eight proteins (i.e., NP, V, P, M, F, SH, HN and L).

The evidence to date supports an important effect of DPP4 in catalytic cleavage of incretin peptides and this perhaps represents the main mechanism by which DPP4 inhibition improves glycemic control. DPP4 also plays an important role in the degradation of multiple chemokines of which stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) is perhaps an increasingly recognized target, given its importance in processes, such as hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and stem cell homing.

Enteric diseases in newborn piglets are often of endemic presentation, but may also occur as outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of different pathogens involved in cases of recurrent neonatal diarrhoea in Spain. RESULTS: A total of 327 litters from 109 sow farms located in Spain with neonatal recurrent diarrhoea were sampled to establish a differential diagnosis against the main enteric pathogens in piglets. In total, 105 out of 109 (96.3%) case submissions were positive to one of the examined enteric organisms considered potentially pathogenic (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens types A and C, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV], Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus [PEDV] or Rotavirus A [RVA]). Fifty-eight out of 109 (53.2%) submissions were positive for only one of these pathogens, 47 out of 109 (43.1%) were positive for more than one pathogen and, finally, 4 out of 109 (3.7%) were negative for all these agents. Escherichia coli strains were isolated from all submissions tested, but only 11 of them were classified into defined pathotypes. Clostridium perfringens type A was detected in 98 submissions (89.9%) and no C. perfringens type C was found. Regarding viruses, 47 (43.1%) submissions were positive for RVA, 4 (3.7%) for PEDV and none of them for TGEV. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, C. perfringens type A, E. coli and RVA were the main pathogens found in faeces of neonatal diarrheic piglets in Spain.","publish_time":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mesonero-Escuredo, Susana; Strutzberg-Minder, Katrin; Casanovas, Carlos; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26945898e55a1c496ddbbf74d0fdec3eeafef9e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5885353.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632701/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-018-0083-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia","E. coli"],"organizations":["RVA","TGEV"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["neonatal recurrent diarrhoea","main pathogens","main enteric pathogens","Spain","perfringens type C","RVA","case submissions","cases of recurrent neonatal diarrhoea","faeces of neonatal diarrheic piglets","newborn piglets","Clostridium perfringens types","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","TGEV","Escherichia coli strains","frequency of different pathogens","Enteric diseases","PEDV","CONCLUSION","total","examined enteric organisms","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","pre-weaning mortality","major disease problem","early stages of animal production","sow farms","differential diagnosis","litters","Rotavirus","outbreaks","high morbidity","endemic presentation","BACKGROUND","target weight","study","RESULTS","defined pathotypes","objective","agents","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Monoclonal antibody reagents that recognise specific antigens on SARS-CoV are needed urgently. In this report, the development and immunochemical characterisation of a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV is presented, based upon their specificity, binding requirements, and biological activity. Initial screening by ELISA, using highly purified virus as the coating antigen, resulted in the selection of 103 mAbs to the SARS virus. Subsequent screening steps reduced this panel to seventeen IgG mAbs. A single mAb, F26G15, is specific for the nucleoprotein as seen in Western immunoblot while five other mAbs react with the Spike protein. Two of these Spike-specific mAbs demonstrate the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV in vitro while another four Western immunoblot-negative mAbs also neutralise the virus. The utility of these mAbs for diagnostic development is demonstrated. Antibody from convalescent SARS patients, but not normal human serum, is also shown to specifically compete off binding of mAbs to whole SARS-CoV. These studies highlight the importance of using standardised assays and reagents. These mAbs will be useful for the development of diagnostic tests, studies of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2004-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Jody D; Jones, Steven; Drebot, Michael A; Andonov, Anton; Sabara, Marta; Yuan, Xin Y; Weingartl, Hana; Fernando, Lisa; Marszal, Peter; Gren, Jason; Nicolas, Brigitte; Andonova, Maya; Ranada, Francesca; Gubbins, Michael J; Ball, T.Blake; Kitching, Paul; Li, Yan; Kabani, Amin; Plummer, Frank","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dadc371023bcc9e2150f5f5d47d7011a0ce4c918.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119589.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093404001272; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093404001272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS virus","studies of SARS","binding of mAbs","SARS-coronavirus","IgG mAbs","negative mAbs","Spike-specific mAbs","convalescent SARS patients","CoV pathogenesis","diagnostic development","specific antigens","vaccine development","development of diagnostic tests","Monoclonal antibody reagents","purified virus","Western","panel of murine monoclonal antibodies","protective antigens","binding requirements","Initial screening","Spike protein","Subsequent screening steps","immunochemical characterisation","ability","F26G15","coating antigen","normal human serum","importance","ELISA","selection","biological activity","standardised assays","specificity","global need","single mAb","report","nucleoprotein","utility"],"language":"en"},

Baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was found to be associated with COVID-19 severity. Indeed, the significant increase of baseline IL-6 was positively correlated to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to the increased baseline of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. High baseline IL-6 was also associated with more progressed chest computed tomography (CT) findings. Significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in patients during recovery, while IL-6 was further increased in exacerbated patients.

However, NHBE cells are expensive, difficult to culture, and vary with the source patient. An alternate approach is to use a continuous cell line that has features of bronchial epithelial cells such as Calu-3, an epithelial cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma, as an in vitro model of respiratory virus infection. The results show that Calu-3 fully polarize when grown on permeable supports as liquid-covered cultures. Polarized Calu-3 are susceptible to RSV infection and release infectious virus primarily from the apical surface, consistent with studies in NHBE cells. The data demonstrate that polarized Calu-3 may serve as a useful in vitro model to study host responses to RSV infection.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Caidi, Hayat; Anderson, Larry J.; Haynes, Lia M.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf7f3eb4d6d3a32dd168816c638341f5d034a994.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112923.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.03.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21458491/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411001182; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411001182","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHBE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model of respiratory virus infection","RSV infection","NHBE cells","infectious virus","Polarized Calu","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus","normal human bronchial epithelial cells","epithelial cell line","upper respiratory tract epithelium","human lung adenocarcinoma","continuous cell line","host interactions","study host responses","analysis of lung tissue response","apical surface","studies","replication","permeable supports","liquid-covered cultures","good system","alternate approach","data","source patient","results"],"language":"en"},

Peak flow can be measured during inspiration or expiration. Of these measurements, nasal inspiratory peak flow is the best validated technique for home monitoring in clinical trials. The equipment is portable, relatively inexpensive, and simple to use. One disadvantage, however, is that nasal inspiratory peak flow is influenced by lower airway as well as upper airway function. Rhinomanometry is a more sensitive technique that is specific for nasal measurements. The equipment, however, requires an operator, is more expensive, and is not portable. Thus, it is applicable only for clinic visit measures in clinical trials. Measurements require patient cooperation and coordination, and not all can achieve repeatable results. Thus, this objective measure is best suited to laboratory challenge studies involving smaller numbers of selected volunteers. A nonphysiological measure of nasal patency is acoustic rhinometry. This sonic echo technique measures internal nasal luminal volume and the minimum cross-sectional area. The derivation of these measures from the reflected sound waves requires complex mathematical transformation and makes several theoretical assumptions. Despite this, however, such measures correlate well with the nasal physiological measures, and the nasal volume measures have been shown to relate well to results obtained by imaging techniques such as computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. Like rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry is not suitable for home monitoring and can be applied only to clinic visit measures or for laboratory nasal challenge monitoring. It has advantages in being easy to use, in requiring little patient cooperation, and in providing repeatable results. In addition to nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis is recognized to be associated with impaired mucociliary clearance and altered nasal responsiveness. Measures exist for the monitoring of these aspects of nasal dysfunction. Although measures of mucociliary clearance are simple to perform, they have a poor record of reproducibility. Their incorporation into clinical trials is thus questionable, although positive outcomes from therapeutic intervention have been reported. Measures of nasal responsiveness are at present largely confined to research studies investigating disease mechanisms in allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. The techniques are insufficiently standardized to be applied to multicenter clinical trials but could be used in limited-center studies to gain insight into the regulatory effects of different therapeutic modalities.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nathan, Robert A.; Eccles, Ron; Howarth, Peter H.; Steinsv\u00E5g, Sverre K.; Togias, Alkis","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ef2b2ac31e6f1c498641e1b775c7120152577ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112320.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674904032713; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674904032713","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal measurements","nasal volume measures","Measures of nasal responsiveness","nasal physiological measures","Nasal obstruction","nasal peak flow","nasal inspiratory peak flow","laboratory nasal challenge monitoring","measurement of nasal airflow","aspects of nasal dysfunction","internal nasal luminal volume","nonphysiological measure of nasal patency","measures of mucociliary clearance","home monitoring","multicenter clinical trials","rhinomanometry","repeatable results","laboratory challenge studies","best validated technique","sensitive technique","research studies","acoustic rhinometry","imaging techniques","equipment","sonic echo technique","limited-center studies","impaired mucociliary clearance","little patient cooperation","lower airway","objective measure","nonallergic rhinitis","therapeutic intervention","magnetic resonance imaging","upper airway function","regulatory effects of different therapeutic modalities","computed tomography scanning","complex mathematical transformation","reflected sound waves","insight","disease mechanisms","smaller numbers of selected volunteers","minimum cross-sectional area","airways resistance","present","positive outcomes","addition","theoretical assumptions","conductance","coordination","inspiration","incorporation","poor record of reproducibility","operator","derivation","advantages","expiration","disadvantage"],"language":"en"},

It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries. Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV. Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367\u2013606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells. The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients\u2019 lives. The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to DPP4 receptor and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection. These findings indicate that this truncated RBD protein shows promise for further development as an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2013-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Kou, Zhihua; Ma, Cuiqing; Tao, Xinrong; Wang, Lili; Zhao, Guangyu; Chen, Yaoqing; Yu, Fei; Tseng, Chien-Te K.; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4c35983add63a4f8eee72b1d8fa864de4147ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3852489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324708/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081587","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV spike","receptor of MERS","inhibited MERS-CoV infection","spread of MERS","prevention of MERS","Fc protein","vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies","truncated RBD protein","recombinant protein","binding of RBD","DPP4 receptor","recombinant S377","human IgG Fc fragment","truncated receptor-binding domain","residues","purified S377","Development of effective therapeutics","patients\u2019 lives","amino acid fragment","Middle East respiratory syndrome","emerging respiratory infectious disease","high mortality","vaccines","safe vaccine","promise","culture supernatant of transfected","T cells","dipeptidyl peptidase","therapeutic modality","findings","novel coronavirus","potential","Saudi Arabia","countries"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study is to characterize an emerging variant pathogenic IBV originating from field outbreaks in vaccinated Egyptian layer flock. Samples were collected from disease-suspected flock with a history of administration of live and inactivated IBV vaccines (Ma5 type). Virus propagation in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs), after three successive passages, revealed typical IBV lesions such as curling and dwarfism. The reported isolate was identified by a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay targeting nucleocapsid (N) gene and, further characterized by full-length spike (S1) gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering of the isolated virus within 4/91 genotype of GI-13 lineage. Deduced amino acid sequences identity revealed 75\u201376% and 88\u201390% similarity with the currently used classic (H120, Ma5, and M41) and variant vaccine strains (4/91 and CR88) in Egypt, respectively. Recombination analysis gave an evidence for distinct patterns of origin for the studied isolate providing another example of intra-genotypic recombination among IBVs and the first example of recombination within the GI-13 lineage in the Egyptian field. The studied isolate (IBV/CK/EG/Fadllah-10/2019) emerged as a result of recombination between the variant group (Egy/var I genotype, GI-23 lineage) as a major parent and the CR88 variant vaccine strain (4/91 genotype, GI-13 lineage) as minor parent. Our data suggest that both mutation and recombination may be contributing to the emergence of IBV variants which ascertain the importance of disease monitoring in vaccinated flocks as well as re-appropriation for the current vaccine strategies.

Our aim was to analyze and present the clinical outcomes of EES for the management of these lesions in a community hospital setting. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 56 patients with sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions who underwent EES between 2010 and 2018. RESULTS: There was male predominance (53.6%) with a mean age of 54.9 \u00B1 13.7 years. Lesions were 45 pituitary adenomas, 5 meningiomas, 3 metastatic, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 Rathke cyst, and 1 mucocele. Gross total excision was achieved in 57.1%, subtotal excision occurred in 37.5%, and decompression and biopsy were achieved in 5.4% patients. Postoperative vision normalized or improved in 27 patients (86.1%) and was stable in 4 patients (13.9%). Recovery of a preexisting hormonal deficit occurred in 13 (23.2%) patients, and a new hormonal deficit occurred in 9 patients (16.1%). The mean hospital stay was 6.1 \u00B1 4.9 days. Postoperative complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak in 8 patients (14.3%). Four patients (7.1%) had meningitis. Diabetes insipidus was present in 19 patients (33.9%), and postoperative intracranial hematoma requiring evacuation was necessary in 2 patients (3.6%). The mean follow-up duration was 47.5 \u00B1 25.8 months. Lesion progression or recurrence requiring redo surgery occurred in 5 patients (8.9%). Regarding the learning curve, the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, new hormonal deficits, and diabetes insipidus decreased in the second half of the patients.

However, there are limited data on the characteristics of the fever and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of CAP between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, the adenovirus-positive (Adv) group, the adenovirus-negative (Non-Adv) group and the unknown pathogen group, according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens. We evaluated and compared the demographics, clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of the 251 military personnel with CAP during the study periods, 67 were classified into the Adv group, while 134 were classified into the Non-Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group. The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of fever after admission (3.2 \u00B1 1.6 vs. 1.9 \u00B1 1.2 vs. 2.2 \u00B1 1.5 days, P = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 \u00B1 2.2 vs. 3.9 \u00B1 2.5 vs. 3.7 \u00B1 2.0 days, P = 0.006) than patients in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The patients in the Adv group had a higher mean temperature at admission (37.8 \u00B1 0.3 vs. 37.3 \u00B1 0.3 vs. 37.3 \u00B1 0.3, P = 0.005), and more patients were observed over 40 and 39 to 40(14.9% vs. 2.2% vs. 4.0%, 35.8% vs. 3.7% vs. 6.0%, P \u003C 0.001) than those in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The Adv group more commonly had no response or exhibited adverse events after antipyretic treatment compared to the Non-Adv group (17.9% vs. 1.5%, 35.0% vs. 4.3%, P \u003C 0.001, P = 0.05, respectively). In addition, the time from admission to overall clinical stabilization was significantly longer in the patients in the Adv group than in those in the Non-Adv group (4.3 \u00B1 2.8 vs. 2.9 \u00B1 1.8 days, P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups, and no patient died in either group. CONCLUSION: In this study, Adv-positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoo, Hongseok; Oh, Jimi; Park, Chul","journal":"Mil Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b50c31a428792413355bec3fe2f5eaa30e73fefe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7033854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32079545/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-00235-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Non-Adv group","Adv-positive CAP","unknown pathogen groups","admission","immunocompetent military personnel patients","treatment of CAP","antipyretic treatment","days","adenovirus-positive community","adenovirus-negative","distinct fever characteristics","antipyretic therapy","longer duration of fever","results","immunocompetent adults","clinicolaboratory findings","radiological findings","Korean military training center","study periods","length of hospital stay","outbreak of adenoviral pneumonia","Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital","PCR","test","responses","polymerase chain reaction","higher mean temperature","sputum culture","time","bacteria","viruses","demographics","adverse events","significant difference","clinical stabilization","respiratory specimens","medical records","limited data","METHODS","addition","symptom onset","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. METHODS: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)) or normoxic (21% O(2)/5% CO(2)) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P \u003C 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-\u03B1\u2212converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/TACE.

Whole genome phylogeny showed that this MERS-CoV strain did not cluster with the other MERS-CoV strains from Dubai that we reported recently. Instead, it formed a unique branch more closely related to other MERS-CoV strains from patients in Qatar and Hafr-Al-Batin in Saudi Arabia, as well as the MERS-CoV strains from patients in the recent Korean outbreak, in which the index patient acquired the infection during travel in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Non-synonymous mutations, resulting in 11 unique amino acid differences, were observed between the MERS-CoV genome from the present study and all the other available MERS-CoV genomes. Among these 11 unique amino acid differences, four were found in ORF1ab, three were found in the S1 domain of the spike protein, and one each was found in the proteins encoded by ORF4b, ORF5, envelope gene, and ORF8. MERS-CoV detection for all other 254 dromedaries in this closed dairy herd was negative by nucleocapsid protein-capture ELISA and RNA detection. MERS-CoV IgG sero-positivity gradually increased in dromedary calves with increasing age, with positivity rates of 75% at zero to three months, 79% at four months, 89% at five to six months, and 90% at seven to twelve months.

Completed questionnaires were received from 66 hospitals (97%). The median number of acute inpatient beds per hospital was 156; this was 522 in regional/tertiary referral centres. Only 31 (47%) hospitals had on-site consultant microbiologist sessions, and there was an infection control nurse in 56 (85%) hospitals. Eighteen (29%) hospitals had an occupational health physician, and 48 (73%) hospitals had an infection control committee. There was a median of one isolation room for every 16 acute beds, and a median of five rooms with en-suite bathroom facilities per hospital in those hospitals that provided data. All hospitals had documented infection control policies, and these were available in electronic format in 25 (38%) hospitals. Fifty-five (83%) hospitals undertook surveillance of nosocomial infection, and alcohol-based hand hygiene facilities were available, either at a handwashing sink or at the entrance to a ward, in 57 (86%) hospitals. In the Republic of Ireland, there remains a significant shortage of microbiologists/infection control doctors, occupational health physicians and infection control nurses. Isolation facilities are also inadequate. Although there is much agreement internationally on the importance of nosocomial infection and the priorities for surveillance, there are no agreed basic minimum standards for the resources and facilities necessary to control and prevent nosocomial infection.","publish_time":"2006-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunney, R.; Humphreys, H.; Murphy, N.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2ff2bd97b524d2afa22221e568df4fa865cc9a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132451.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670106002167; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670106002167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Republic"],"keyphrases":["acute hospitals","infection control doctors","infection control nurses","infection control committee","surveillance of nosocomial infection","documented infection control policies","importance of nosocomial infection","control of antimicrobial resistance","Isolation facilities","resources available","facilities necessary","acute beds","median number of acute inpatient beds","Republic of Ireland","en-suite bathroom facilities","occupational health physicians","alcohol-based hand hygiene facilities","isolation room","significant shortage of microbiologists","current practice","agreed basic minimum standards","development of national guidelines","rooms","on-site consultant microbiologist sessions","priorities","entrance","tertiary referral centres","Summary","handwashing sink","survey","electronic format","agreement","data","ward","questionnaires"],"language":"en"},

No MERS vaccines are licensed for human use, reinforcing the urgency to develop safe and efficacious vaccines to prevent MERS. MERS-CoV spike protein forms a trimer, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) serves as a vaccine target. Nevertheless, the protective efficacy of RBD in its native trimeric form has never been evaluated. In this study, a trimeric protein, RBD-Fd, was generated by fusing RBD with foldon trimerization motif. It bound strongly to the receptor of MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and elicited robust RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, maintaining long-term neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection. RBD-Fd potently protected hDPP4 transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that MERS-CoV RBD in its trimeric form maintains native conformation and induces protective neutralizing antibodies, making it a candidate for further therapeutic development.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tai, Wanbo; Zhao, Guangyu; Sun, Shihun; Guo, Yan; Wang, Yufei; Tao, Xinrong; Tseng, Chien-Te K.; Li, Fang; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b45de2f44dbed76d9997f1088e62c4dfcd82a72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5167628.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216303002; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.10.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216303002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27750111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV RBD","MERS vaccines","receptor of MERS","MERS-CoV infection","RBD-Fd","MERS-CoV spike protein","lethal MERS-CoV challenge","protective efficacy of RBD","elicited robust RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies","trimeric protein","protective neutralizing antibodies","native trimeric form","long-term neutralizing activity","native conformation","efficacious vaccines","human use","human health","receptor-binding domain","protected hDPP4 transgenic mice","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome","coronavirus","urgency","dipeptidyl peptidase","candidate","foldon trimerization motif","study","results","therapeutic development","vaccine target"],"language":"en"},

For a homogeneous population, we find that: (i) the susceptible proportion is s * = 1 / R 0 e , where R 0 e is a modified reproduction number, equal to R 0 only in certain circumstances; (ii) the proportions of the population in each stage of infection are proportional to the expected time spent by an infected individual in that stage before recovery or death. We demonstrate robustness of the formula s * = 1 / R 0 for many human infections by noting conditions under which R 0 e is approximately equal to R 0, while pointing out other circumstances under which this approximation fails.

To characterize the coughed viral aerosol, the sampler needs to sample at higher flow rate and possess high physical collection efficiency as well as high viral preservation. However, most current inertia-based high flow bioaerosol samplers are not suited for viral aerosol sampling since the viability will be lost doing the sampling process. Current condensation growth methods only have good physical collection efficiency and viral preservation at low flow rate (\u003C 10 LPM). In this study, we developed a viral aerosol sampling system using a cooler and steam-jet aerosol collector (SJAC) for bioaerosol collection for the first time. The system is based on mixing condensation growth method and has high viral preservation at a higher flow rate (12.5 LPM). We control the inlet aerosol flow temperature and the SJAC mixing reservoir temperature to improve the physical collection efficiency and viability preservation of the viral aerosol. Results indicate that the physical collection efficiency is 70\u201399% for aerosol 30\u2013100 nm when the aerosol flow and mixing reservoir temperature was 19 and 50 \u00B0C, respectively. In addition, the system was 7 and 22 times more efficient for viability preservation of MS2 bacteriophage than the commonly used All Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) and BioSampler\u00AE, respectively. Finally, the system can be applied to sample at a lower concentration (10(5) PFU/m(3)), and results shows the system was 4.7 times more efficient for viability preservation than using AGI-30 alone. The developed viral collection system will improve our understanding of the characteristics of coughed aerosol and can be used for future evaluation of respiratory protective equipment and environmental sampling.","publish_time":"2017-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Xiao-Ting; Hsu, Nai-Yun; Wang, Jen-Ren; Chen, Nai-Tzu; Su, Huey-Jen; Lin, Ming-Yeng","journal":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44031097dd39d7fde7b22c1115fc23ed0ac076dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29177778/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0754-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glass Impinger"],"organizations":["SJAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral aerosol sampling system","coughed viral aerosol","Viral aerosol infection","high viral preservation","developed viral collection system","large amounts of viral aerosol","inlet aerosol flow temperature","characteristics of coughed aerosol","high physical collection efficiency","bioaerosol collection","good physical collection efficiency","higher flow rate","steam-jet aerosol collector","low flow rate","high flow bioaerosol samplers","viability preservation of MS2 bacteriophage","mixing reservoir temperature","environmental sampling","sampling process","SJAC","mixing condensation growth method","times","AGI","LPM","Results","Current condensation growth methods","current inertia","severe acute respiratory syndrome","future evaluation of respiratory protective equipment","influenza flu","understanding","adverse health effects","SARS","lower concentration","Glass Impinger","study","PFU","BioSampler","addition"],"language":"en"},

Mucosal HPVs have evolved mechanisms that impede IFN-\u03B2 synthesis and downregulate genes induced by IFN. Here we show that these HPV types directly subvert a cellular transcriptional response to IFN-\u03B2 as a potential boost in infection. Treatment with low levels of human IFN-\u03B2 induced initial amplification of HPV-16 and HPV-11 plasmid genomes and increased HPV-16 or HPV-31 DNA copy numbers up to 6-fold in HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. IFN treatment also increased early gene transcription from the major early gene promoters in HPV-16, HPV-31 and HPV-11. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the viral genomes and ectopic interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression in transfection experiments using IRF-1 (\u2212/\u2212) , IRF-2 (\u2212/\u2212) and dual knockout cell lines determined that these responses are due to the activation of IRF-1 interaction with a conserved interferon response element demonstrated in several mucosal HPV early gene promoters.

A nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method was developed to detect a portion of the haemagglutinin gene of avian influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7 irrespective of lineage. A further NASBA assay, based on the matrix gene, was able to detect examples of all known subtypes (H1\u2013H15) of avian influenza virus.

Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris, Mallory J.; Hay, Simon I.; Drake, John M.","journal":"Biol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d62a5bd6b927e5eac13751a66df4458f3fdc4c13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["difference of variance","summary statistics","disease transmission system","early warning signals of critical slowing","early warning signals of resurgence","autocorrelation","lag","infectious disease systems","time series of disease incidence","local transmission chain","decay time","characteristic signatures","characteristic behaviours","resurgence of malaria","infectious diseases","ordinary surveillance activities","transition","infection","stability","approach","rolling window","prediction","instance","extinction","disease-free equilibrium","methods","autocovariance","size of effect","imported case","fluctuations","number of cases","phenomenon","criticality","speed","Kericho","Kenya","outbreak","permutation tests","phenomena","increases","results","empirical test","directions","Campaigns"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, in order to specify the effects of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the immune system, one half of the cats (n = 15) were previously infected with the Swiss isolate FIV Zurich 2. The second half of the animals (n = 15) served as non-infected controls. Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals. The whole group of cats was observed for over 3 years. There were no further vaccinations during this period. CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4(\u002B):CD8(\u002B) ratio than FeLV infection.

Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes.

So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes.

Three post-EAV infection equine sera raised against different EAV isolates reacted strongly in the ELISA, as did two equine sera raised against EAV vaccines, indicating that the viral epitope was conserved between the viruses tested.

The binding of S1P to five G protein-coupled S1P receptors regulates many physiological systems, particularly the immune and vascular systems. Our understanding of the functions of S1P has been aided by the tractability of the system to both chemical and genetic manipulation. Chemical modulators have been generated to affect most of the known components of S1P biology, including agonists of S1P receptors and inhibitors of enzymes regulating S1P production and degradation. Genetic knockouts and manipulations have been similarly engineered to disrupt the functions of individual S1P receptors or enzymes involved in S1P metabolism.

Achieving this goal seemed inevitable in 1982 when a series of calcium channel blockers were demonstrated to restore the efficacy of chemotherapy agents. A large number of other compounds have since been demonstrated to restore chemotherapeutic sensitivity in cancer cells or tissues. Where do we stand almost three decades since the first reports of ABCB1 inhibition? Unfortunately, in the aftermath of extensive fundamental and clinical research efforts the situation remains gloomy. Only a small handful of compounds have reached late stage clinical trials and none are in routine clinical usage to circumvent chemoresistance. Why has the translation process been so ineffective? One factor is the multifactorial nature of drug resistance inherent to cancer tissues; ABCB1 is not the sole factor. However, expression of ABCB1 remains a significant negative prognostic indicator and is closely associated with poor response to chemotherapy in many cancer types. The main difficulties with restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy reside with poor properties of the ABCB1 inhibitors: (1) low selectivity to ABCB1, (2) poor potency to inhibit ABCB1, (3) inherent toxicity and/or (4) adverse pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs. Despite these difficulties, there is a clear requirement for effective inhibitors and to date the strategies for generating such compounds have involved serendipity or simple chemical syntheses. This chapter outlines more sophisticated approaches making use of bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry and structure informed drug design. Generating a new arsenal of potent and selective ABCB1 inhibitors offers the promise of restoring the efficacy of a key weapon in cancer treatment \u2013 chemotherapy.","publish_time":"2009-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crowley, Emily; McDevitt, Christopher A.; Callaghan, Richard","journal":"Multi-Drug Resistance in Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dbcc029cf2eac4ce4b6684fc2f1f7f06312c53e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121335.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of ABCB1","selective ABCB1 inhibitors","reports of ABCB1 inhibition","drug efflux pump ABCB1","cancer tissues","efficacy of chemotherapy agents","cancer cells","cancer treatment","cancer types","efficacy of anticancer drugs","effective inhibitors","poor properties","poor response","poor potency","multifactorial nature of drug resistance inherent","clinical research efforts","routine clinical usage","small handful of compounds","structure informed drug design","late stage clinical trials","mediating resistance","chemotherapeutic sensitivity","restoration of sensitivity","inherent toxicity","main difficulties","sole factor","combinatorial chemistry","P-glycoprotein","use of bioinformatics","aftermath of extensive fundamental","situation","key weapon","significant negative prognostic indicator","sophisticated approaches","new arsenal of potent","prominent role","serendipity","adverse pharmacokinetic interactions","clear requirement","promise","simple chemical syntheses","series of calcium channel blockers","low selectivity","chapter","chemoresistance","strategies","incredible drive","translation process","large number","decades","goal"],"language":"en"},

Various epigenetic mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we examined the effects of ten epigenetic agents on pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection by using GFP-reporter assays. Inhibitors of bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4), which receives much more attention in cancer than viral infection, was found to exhibit substantial anti-viral activity against PRV as well as a range of DNA and RNA viruses. We further demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition boosted a robust innate immune response. BRD4 inhibition also de-compacted chromatin structure and induced the DNA damage response, thereby triggering the activation of cGAS-mediated innate immunity and increasing host resistance to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition on viral infection was mainly attributed to the attenuation of viral attachment. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism through which BRD4 inhibition restrains viral infection and points to its potent therapeutic value for viral infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiang; Li, Guo-Li; Ming, Sheng-Li; Wang, Chun-Feng; Shi, Li-Juan; Su, Bing-Qian; Wu, Hong-Tao; Zeng, Lei; Han, Ying-Qian; Liu, Zhong-Hu; Jiang, Da-Wei; Du, Yong-Kun; Li, Xiang-Dong; Zhang, Gai-Ping; Yang, Guo-Yu; Chu, Bei-Bei","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c97e0b3f7315db8cc9c653102971f093e9e41fdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122826.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","viral infectious diseases","attenuation of viral attachment","inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition","substantial anti-viral activity","PRV","epigenetic modification","epigenetic agents","DNA damage response","Various epigenetic mechanisms","innate immunity","Chromatin dynamics","robust innate immune response","range of DNA","pathogenesis of human diseases","de-compacted chromatin structure","potent therapeutic value","points","genome stability","pseudorabies virus","host resistance","unique mechanism","gene expression","activation of cGAS","GFP-reporter assays","RNA viruses","effects","Inhibitors of bromodomain protein","attention","cancer","findings"],"language":"en"}]}

Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the changes in arterial pressure and gene expression of components of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) and neuroinflammatory markers in the NTS of rats fed a HFD and treated with either an AT1R blocker or with virus-mediated AT2R overexpression in the NTS. Male Holtzman rats (300\u2013320 g) were fed either a standard rat chow diet (SD) or HFD for 6 weeks before commencing the tests. AT1R blockade in the NTS of HFD-fed rats attenuated the increase in arterial pressure and the impairment of reflex bradycardia, whereas AT2R overexpression in the NTS only improved the baroreflex function. The HFD also increased the hypertensive and decreased the protective axis of the RAS and was associated with neuroinflammation within the NTS. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neuroinflammatory components, but not AT1R, in the NTS was reduced by AT2R overexpression in this site. Based on these data, AT1R and AT2R in the NTS are differentially involved in the cardiovascular changes induced by a HFD. Chronic inflammation and changes in the RAS in the NTS may also account for the cardiovascular responses observed in HFD-fed rats.","publish_time":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Speretta, Guilherme F.; Ruchaya, Prashant J.; Delbin, Maria A.; Melo, Mariana R.; Li, Hongwei; Menani, Jos\u00E9 V.; Sumners, Colin; Colombari, Eduardo; Bassi, Mirian; Colombari, D\u00E9bora S.

The spectrum of illness ranges from acute bronchitis, which is very common, through influenza virus infection and exacerbations of underlying lung disease, to pneumonia, which, fortunately is uncommon (\u003C1.5% LRTI), but can be severe. Acute bronchitis is generally mild, self-limiting and usually does not require antibacterial therapy. Influenza virus infection in pregnant women has been recently related to increased hospitalization for acute cardiorespiratory conditions. At present, the safety of the newer neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza virus infection has not been established in pregnancy and they are not routinely recommended. In influenza virus infection complicated by pneumonia, antibacterial agents active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfection should be used. There are few data on infective complications of asthma or COPD in pregnancy. The latter is rare, as patients with COPD are usually male and aged over 45 years. Management is the same as for nonpregnant patients. The incidence and mortality of pneumonia in pregnancy is similar to that in nonpregnant patients. Infants born to pregnant patients with pneumonia have been found to be born earlier and weigh less than controls. Risk factors for the development of pneumonia include anemia, asthma and use of antepartum corticosteroids and tocolytic agents. Based on the few available studies, the main pathogens causing pneumonia are S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and viruses. \u03B2-Lactam and macrolide antibiotics therefore remain the antibiotics of choice in terms of both pathogen coverage and safety in pregnancy. In HIV-infected pregnant patients, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, but not Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), is more common than in nonpregnant patients. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) has not definitely been associated with adverse clinical outcomes despite theoretical risks. Currently it is still the treatment of choice in PCP, where mortality remains high. In conclusion, there are few data specifically related to pregnant women with different types of LRTI. Where data are available, no significant differences compared with nonpregnant patients have been identified. In considering the use of any therapeutic agent or investigation in pregnant patients with LRTI, safety aspects must be carefully weighed against potential benefit. Otherwise, management strategies should not differ from those for nonpregnant patients. Further research in this area is warranted.","publish_time":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Wei Shen; Macfarlane, John T.; Colthorpe, Charlotte L.","journal":"Am J Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c67e2135484bb0037ab424597be97d9bb207f68c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100023.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonpregnant patients","mortality of pneumonia","development of pneumonia","pregnant women","HIV-infected pregnant patients","pregnancy","treatment of influenza virus infection","recurrent bacterial pneumonia","Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia","data","acute bronchitis","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","incidence of lower respiratory tract infection","women of child","antibiotics of choice","safety aspects","different types of LRTI","treatment of choice","PCP","COPD","Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfection","antibacterial agents active","acute cardiorespiratory conditions","macrolide antibiotics","tocolytic agents","available studies","antibacterial therapy","management strategies","infective complications of asthma","Staphylococcus aureus","Haemophilus influenzae","exacerbations of underlying lung disease","investigation","newer neuraminidase inhibitors","terms","pathogen coverage","main pathogens","therapeutic agent","significant differences","antepartum corticosteroids","increased hospitalization","adverse clinical outcomes","theoretical risks","viruses","anemia","\u03B2-Lactam","spectrum of illness","Risk factors","Infants","Trimethoprim","sulfamethoxazole","cotrimoxazole","present","potential benefit","research","area","population","years","conclusion","controls"],"language":"en"},

Interactions between co-occurring pathogens in a population may be mutualistic, competitive or facilitative. For some pathogen combinations, these interrelated effects will have epidemiological consequences; however this is as yet poorly incorporated into practical disease ecology. For example, screening of Mallards for influenza A viruses (IAV) have repeatedly revealed high prevalence and large subtype diversity in the Northern Hemisphere. Other studies have identified avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) and coronaviruses (CoVs) in Mallards, but without making inferences on the larger viral assemblage. In this study we followed 144 wild Mallards across an autumn season in a natural stopover site and constructed infection histories of IAV, APMV-1 and CoV. There was a high prevalence of IAV, comprising of 27 subtype combinations, while APMV-1 had a comparatively low prevalence (with a peak of 2%) and limited strain variation, similar to previous findings. Avian CoVs were common, with prevalence up to 12%, and sequence analysis identified different putative genetic lineages. An investigation of the dynamics of co-infections revealed a synergistic effect between CoV and IAV, whereby CoV prevalence was higher given that the birds were co-infected with IAV. There were no interactive effects between IAV and APMV-1. Disease dynamics are the result of an interplay between parasites, host immune responses, and resources; and is imperative that we begin to include all factors to better understand infectious disease risk.","publish_time":"2014-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Avril, Alexis; Tolf, Conny; Schager, Anna; Larsson, Sara; Borg, Olivia; Olsen, Bj\u00F6rn; Waldenstr\u00F6m, Jonas","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df46bf0f02a7a1acdb3792013774d7efe6eef372.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106038.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134814004171; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.11.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25461850/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134814004171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high prevalence of IAV","APMV","CoV prevalence","low prevalence","constructed infection histories of IAV","Disease dynamics","multiple parasites","Multiple infections","screening of Mallards","wild Mallards","dynamics of co-infections","subtype combinations","Avian CoVs","infectious disease risk","practical disease ecology","simultaneous infection","interrelated effects","interactive effects","pathogen combinations","large subtype diversity","host immune responses","avian paramyxovirus type","natural stopover site","autumn season","interplay","synergistic effect","population","limited strain variation","sequence analysis","different putative genetic lineages","influenza","previous findings","resources","Northern Hemisphere","inferences","result","birds","co-occurring pathogens","larger viral assemblage","Interactions","epidemiological consequences","studies","factors","example","rule","peak","investigation","coronaviruses","study","exception"],"language":"en"},

Since cytokines play a central role in the initiation and development of inflammation, we evaluated the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in AIR patient sera. We demonstrate that IL-6 and CXCL9 are both elevated in AIR patient sera. Moreover, the presence and concentration of these 2 molecules appear to correlate with AIR patient disease severity. This cytokine profile, IL-6 and CXCL9, has been described to participate in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our study provides support for an activated inflammatory process in AIR and identifies possible mechanisms that can drive autoimmunity in this disease.","publish_time":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Detrick, Barbara; Gangaputra, Sapna; Palsgrove, Doreen N; Heaney, Christopher D; Hooks, John J; Sen, H Nida","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f61e882d447ad3f4eee81d8242869dc201042d89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5801042.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572817302692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29310941/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2017.12.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817302692","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AIR patient sera","AIR patient disease severity","prominent features of AIR","Autoimmune retinopathy","role of inflammation","CXCL9","presence of proinflammatory cytokines","inflammatory diseases","central role","development of inflammation","variety of autoimmune","activated inflammatory process","rare immune-mediated retinopathy","photoreceptor dysfunction","visual field deficits","chemokines","circulating antiretinal antibodies","setting of progressive unexplained vision loss","possible mechanisms","support","initiation","molecules","ARAs","autoimmunity","study","cytokine profile","concentration"],"language":"en"},

Serum samples from dromedary camels (n = 86) were used to determine camel anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA positivity. Human samples collected between 2009 and 2016 from \u003E20 years old Bedouins (n = 305), non-Bedouin Arabs (n = 320) and Jews (n = 195), were randomly selected using an age-stratified sampling design. Human HEV IgG levels were determined using Wantai IgG ELISA assay. Of the samples obtained from camels, 68.6% were anti-HEV positive. Among the human populations, Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs had a significantly higher prevalence of HEV antibodies (21.6% and 15.0%, respectively) compared with the Jewish population (3.1%). Seropositivity increased significantly with age in all human populations, reaching 47.6% and 34.8% among \u2A7E40 years old, in Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs, respectively. The high seropositivity in camels and in \u2A7E40 years old Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs suggests that HEV is endemic in Israel.

The co-circulation of multiple IBV types and the ongoing emergence of IBV variants are the epidemiological challenges in China. Factors contributing to the continual emergence include mutations, insertions and deletions in the S1 protein genes; recombination between local IBV strains circulating in chicken flocks in China; and recombination between local strains and vaccine strains. Vaccination-challenge analysis between circulating field strains and Mass-type H120 vaccine indicated the need to develop new vaccines from local IBV strains. These results also emphasize the importance of continued IBV surveillance in China.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Zongxi; Sun, Chuyang; Yan, Baolong; Zhang, Xiaonan; Wang, Yu; Li, Chengren; Zhang, Qingxia; Ma, Yazhen; Shao, Yuhao; Liu, Qiaoran; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9776cea82e94b7dcf730f6918259099516b29d19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833270/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2010.09.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134810002467; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134810002467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["local IBV strains","local strains","vaccine strains","China","reference strains","circulating field strains","ongoing emergence of IBV variants","S1 gene","importance of continued IBV surveillance","co-circulation of multiple IBV types","recombination","phylogenetic study","comprehensive study","S1 protein genes","continual emergence","sequence analysis","Vaccination-challenge analysis","Mass-type H120 vaccine","epidemiology","insertions","deletions","need","pathogenicity of infectious bronchitis virus","chicken flocks","new vaccines","epidemiological challenges","mutations","molecular characterization","isolates","results","Factors","year period"],"language":"en"},

It is acknowledged that filling this gap needs a combination of rigorous sampling and improved diagnostic technologies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are powerful tools with the potential for comprehensive and unbiased detection of pathogens in clinical samples. We reviewed the use of this new technology for the diagnosis of suspected infectious encephalitis, and discuss the feasibility for introduction of NGS methods as a frontline diagnostic test. Methods A systematic literature review was performed, using MESH and text word searches for variants of \u201Csequencing\u201D and \u201Cencephalitis\u201D in Medline and EMbase, and searching bibliographies and citations using the Web of Science database. Two authors independently reviewed, extracted and summarised data. Findings The review identified 25 articles reporting 44 case reports of patients with suspected encephalitis for whom NGS was used as a diagnostic tool. We present the data and highlight themes arising from these cases. There are no randomly controlled trials to assess the utility of NGS as a diagnostic tool. Interpretation There is increasing evidence of a role for NGS in the work-up of undiagnosed encephalitis. Lower costs and increasing accessibility of these technologies will facilitate larger studies of these patients. We recommend NGS should be considered as a front-line diagnostic test in chronic and recurring presentations and, given current sample-to-result turn-around times, as second-line in acute cases of encephalitis.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Julianne R.; Bharucha, Tehmina; Breuer, Judith","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f3dfa1d4e3ffba1d199cbdf180baa47805a2e67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112567.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305150/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445317304139; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445317304139; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2017.12.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected encephalitis","utility of NGS","aetiology of encephalitis","diagnostic tool","undiagnosed encephalitis","introduction of NGS methods","acute cases of encephalitis","front-line diagnostic test","frontline diagnostic test","improved diagnostic technologies","diagnosis of suspected infectious encephalitis","half of clinical cases","current sample","generation sequencing","clinical samples","summarised data","case reports of patients","systematic literature review","Abstract Background Current estimates","recurring presentations","MESH","potential","unbiased detection of pathogens","combination of rigorous sampling","powerful tools","citations","variants","articles","feasibility","text word searches","new technology","bibliographies","accessibility","result turn","EMbase","work","larger studies","Web of Science database","times","gap","evidence","resourced settings","Medline","role","Lower costs","controlled trials","use","Findings","themes","authors","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

To understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by MVM, three types of capsids, virus-like particles, wild type empty (no DNA) capsids, and DNA packaged virions, were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). Both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-O-methylated sialic acid derivatives, while MVMp showed additional binding to 9-O-acetylated and 9-O-lactoylated sialic acid derivatives, indicating recognition differences. The glycans recognized contained a type-2 Gal\u03B21-4GlcNAc motif (Neu5Ac\u03B12-3Gal\u03B21-4GlcNAc or 3\u2032SIA-LN) and were biantennary complex-type N-glycans with the exception of one. To correlate the recognition of the 3\u2032SIA-LN glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for MVMp, MVMi, or both strains, the N- and O-glycans, and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies, A9 fibroblasts, EL4 T lymphocytes, and the SV40 transformed NB324K cells, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by MVM. Significantly, the NB324K showed fucosylation at the non-reducing end of their biantennary glycans, suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the Lewis X motif as in 3\u2032SIA-Le(X) identified in a previous glycan microarray screen.","publish_time":"2014-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halder, Sujata; Cotmore, Susan; Heimburg-Molinaro, Jamie; Smith, David F.; Cummings, Richard D.; Chen, Xi; Trollope, Alana J.; North, Simon J.; Haslam, Stuart M.; Dell, Anne; Tattersall, Peter; McKenna, Robert; Agbandje-McKenna, Mavis","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e77269850b7b4bf57514e226ea66cd48ac31db5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3903596.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGM","MVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-glycans","recognition of sialic acids","biantennary glycans","cellular recognition","recognition differences","SIA-LN glycan motif","MVMp","recognition of different modifications of sialic acid","sialylated glycan microarray","O-methylated sialic acid derivatives","O-lactoylated sialic acid derivatives","previous glycan microarrays","sialylated glycan motifs","biantennary complex-type N-glycans","GlcNAc motif","previous glycan microarray screen","NB324K cells","biantennary structures","wild type","MVMi","viruses","Lewis X motif","SGM","cell lines permissive","strains of minute virus of mice","MALDI-TOF","types of capsids","additional binding","DNA packaged virions","TOF mass spectrometry","natural expression","EL4 T lymphocytes","studies","role","A9 fibroblasts","non-reducing end","polar glycolipids present","SV40","Neu5Ac\u03B12-3Gal\u03B21","essential requirement","fucosylation","particles","prototype","abundance","successful infection","potential","preference","exception"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged \u226516 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8\u201310 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 \u03BCg per week for 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis. We used \u03C72 and Fischer\u0027s exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables. Findings We analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0\u20138] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group). Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5\u00B788 \u00D7 109/L [SD 3\u00B795] vs 9\u00B788 \u00D7 109/L [6\u00B763]; p=0\u00B7023). 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0\u00B7004). After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0\u00B7054). Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4\u00B732 g/L [SD 2\u00B747] vs 2\u00B714 g/L [1\u00B790]; p=0\u00B7002). Interpretation In patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days. Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a begomovirus, which is the largest and most economically important group of plant viruses, transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. The circulation of TYLCV in the insect involves complex insect-virus interactions, whereas the molecular mechanisms of these interactions remain ambiguous. The insect gut as a barrier for viral entry and dissemination is thought to regulate the vector specificity. However, due to its tiny size, information for the responses of whitefly gut to virus infection is limited. METHODS: We investigated the transcriptional response of the gut of B. tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 species to TYLCV infection using Illumina sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 5207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between viruliferous and non-viruliferous whitefly guts were identified. Enrichment analyses showed that cargo receptor and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were enriched in DEGs, and might help the virus to cross gut barrier. TYLCV could perturb cell cycle and DNA repair as a possible result of its replication in the whitefly. Our data also demonstrated that TYLCV can activate whitefly defense responses, such as antimicrobial peptides. Meanwhile, a number of genes involved in intracellular signaling were activated by TYLCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the complex insect-virus relationship in whitefly gut and provide substantial molecular information for the role of insect midguts in virus transmission.

However, a large-scale study on the prevalence of viral infections across multiple provinces and seasons has not been previously reported from China. Here, we aimed to identify the viral etiologies associated with ALRIs from 22 Chinese provinces. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients in 108 sentinel hospitals in 24 provinces of China was conducted from January 2009-September 2013. We enrolled hospitalized all-age patients with ALRI, and collected respiratory specimens, blood or serum collected for diagnostic testing for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human influenza virus, adenoviruses (ADV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV) and human bocavirus (hBoV). We included 28,369 ALRI patients from 81 (of the 108) sentinel hospitals in 22 (of the 24) provinces, and 10,387 (36.6%) were positive for at least one etiology. The most frequently detected virus was RSV (9.9%), followed by influenza (6.6%), PIV (4.8%), ADV (3.4%), hBoV (1.9), hMPV (1.5%) and hCoV (1.4%). Co-detections were found in 7.2% of patients. RSV was the most common etiology (17.0%) in young children aged \u003C2 years. Influenza viruses were the main cause of the ALRIs in adults and elderly. PIV, hBoV, hMPV and ADV infections were more frequent in children, while hCoV infection was distributed evenly in all-age. There were clear seasonal peaks for RSV, influenza, PIV, hBoV and hMPV infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could serve as robust evidence for public health authorities in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ALRIs associated with viral pathogens. RSV is common in young children and prevention measures could have large public health impact. Influenza was most common in adults and influenza vaccination should be implemented on a wider scale in China.","publish_time":"2014-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Luzhao; Li, Zhongjie; Zhao, Shiwen; Nair, Harish; Lai, Shengjie; Xu, Wenbo; Li, Mengfeng; Wu, Jianguo; Ren, Lili; Liu, Wei; Yuan, Zhenghong; Chen, Yu; Wang, Xinhua; Zhao, Zhuo; Zhang, Honglong; Li, Fu; Ye, Xianfei; Li, Sa; Feikin, Daniel; Yu, Hongjie; Yang, Weizhong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8a900446a0ac1e4d0096ab06f805c253a75523c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4063718.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945280/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALRI","ADV","RSV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["human influenza virus","RSV","hMPV infections","PIV","hBoV","provinces of China","ADV infections","influenza vaccination","Influenza viruses","human parainfluenza virus","human coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","hospitalized ALRI patients","respiratory syncytial virus","prevalence of viral infections","Acute lower respiratory infections","detected virus","young children","control ALRIs","hospitalized all-age patients","multiple provinces","common etiology","Chinese provinces","respiratory specimens","FINDINGS","hCoV infection","adults","viral pathogens","viral etiologies","sentinel hospitals","public health authorities","important cause of acute illnesses","main cause","large public health impact","prevention measures","diagnostic testing","serum","Active surveillance","adenoviruses","blood","robust evidence","mortality","clear seasonal peaks","BACKGROUND","seasons","large-scale study","METHODS","wider scale","years","Co-detections","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, the compositions of plasma donor pools used for IG manufacturing are not standardized. While all immune globulin products meet the specifications set by the US FDA for antibodies to pathogens like measles and polio, they have variable levels of antibodies to other important viruses and infectious pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: An IVIG was developed that satisfies the requirements for treating patients with primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD) and also has standardized elevated levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies (RI-002). Plasma donors who have naturally occurring high circulating levels of neutralizing anti-RSV antibody were selected as the source for manufacturing IVIG to treat patients with PIDD to prevent serious bacterial infections. While the introduction of the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab has had a dramatic impact in diminishing the burden of RSV disease in the pediatric population, it does not meet the standards for replacing the deficient immune compartments of patients with PIDD. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with PIDD at 9 different sites across the US were enrolled in this study and received regular infusions of RI-002 over the course of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There were zero serious bacterial infections, thus meeting the primary endpoint for this trial. The secondary endpoints including days missed from work due to infection, unscheduled visits to the physician, and days of hospitalization due to infection compared favorably to published reports of other IVIG products.","publish_time":"2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wasserman, Richard L.; Lumry, William; Harris, James; Levy, Robyn; Stein, Mark; Forbes, Lisa; Cunningham-Rundles, Charlotte; Melamed, Isaac; Kobayashi, Ai Lan; Du, Wei; Kobayashi, Roger","journal":"J Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a8a6f65da6c9eca4117de59c6377a0ff02a0d09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4940435.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-016-0308-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IG","IVIG","RSV","PIDD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PIDD","anti-RSV antibody","elevated levels of RSV","deficient immune compartments of patients","Immune globulins","manufacturing IVIG","IVIG products","variable levels of antibodies","burden of RSV disease","immune globulin products","primary immune deficiency disease","serious bacterial infections","high circulating levels","monoclonal antibody Palivizumab","specific antibody composition","infectious pathogens","primary endpoint","US FDA","IG manufacturing","days of hospitalization","Plasma donors","regular infusions of RI","compositions of plasma donor pools","work","important viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","differentiating features","physician","dramatic impact","measles","specifications","polio","source","unscheduled visits","PURPOSE","IgG supplementation","study","different sites","requirements","pediatric population","secondary endpoints","introduction","standards","reports","years","course","trial","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Methods A case of Aspergillus meningitis is described. A comprehensive review of the English-language literature was conducted to identify all reported cases of Aspergillus meningitis described between January 1973 and December 2011. Results Ninety-three cases (including the one described herein) of Aspergillus meningitis were identified. Fifty-two (55.9%) were in individuals without any predisposing factor or known causes of immunosuppression. Acute and chronic meningitis was diagnosed in 65.6% of patients and meningoencephalitis in 24.7% of them with the remaining presenting with spinal arachnoiditis and ventriculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for Aspergillus spp. were positive in about 31% of cases and the galactomannan antigen test in 87%. Diagnosis during life was achieved in 52 patients (55.9%) with a case fatality rate of 50%. The overall case fatality rate was 72.1%. Conclusions Aspergillus meningitis may occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and run an acute or chronic course. The findings of this systematic review extend the information on this life-threatening infection and could assist physicians in achieving an improved outcome.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antinori, Spinello; Corbellino, Mario; Meroni, Luca; Resta, Federico; Sollima, Salvatore; Tonolini, Massimo; Tortorano, Anna Maria; Milazzo, Laura; Bello, Lorenzo; Furfaro, Elisa; Galli, Massimo; Viscoli, Claudio","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66b828da1b8236ccd8d38805d1f0a98fd85cbc1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112586.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445312003374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178421/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445312003374; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2012.11.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of Aspergillus meningitis","outcome of Aspergillus meningitis","Conclusions Aspergillus meningitis","reported cases of Aspergillus meningitis","chronic meningitis","cerebrospinal fluid findings","overall case fatality rate","meningoencephalitis","immunocompromised patients","Cerebrospinal fluid cultures","comprehensive review","systematic review","spinal arachnoiditis","improved outcome","chronic course","pathogenesis","clinical presentation","predisposing factor","information","physicians","English-language literature","ventriculitis","life-threatening infection","causes of immunosuppression","galactomannan antigen test","Methods","Summary Objectives","individuals","Diagnosis","Results"],"language":"en"},

The attention of bioinformaticians to this interesting and challenging field is far from commensurate with its medical and biotechnological importance. It is telling that out of \u003E200 talks held at ISMB 2013, the largest international bioinformatics conference, only one presentation explicitly dealt with viruses. In contrast to many broad, established and well-organized bioinformatics communities (e.g. structural genomics, ontologies, next-generation sequencing, expression analysis), research groups focusing on viruses can probably be counted on the fingers of two hands. Results: The purpose of this review is to increase awareness among bioinformatics researchers about the pressing needs and unsolved problems of computational virology. We focus primarily on RNA viruses that pose problems to many standard bioinformatics analyses owing to their compact genome organization, fast mutation rate and low evolutionary conservation. We provide an overview of tools and algorithms for handling viral sequencing data, detecting functionally important RNA structures, classifying viral proteins into families and investigating the origin and evolution of viruses.

METHODS: Non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests admitted between 7 February and 12 February 2020 to Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital, which was promptly constructed because of the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, were included; clinical course through to 22 February was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1012 non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were included in the study. Thirty (of 1012, 3.0%) individuals were asymptomatic on admission. During hospitalization, 16 of 30 (53.3%) asymptomatic individuals developed different symptoms. Fourteen of 1012 patients (1.4%) remained asymptomatic from exposure to the end of follow up, with a median duration of 24 days (interquartile range 22\u201327). Fever (761 of 1012, 75.2%) and cough (531 of 1012, 52.4%) were the most common symptoms. Small patchy opacities (355 of 917, 38.7%) and ground-glass opacities (508 of 917, 55.4%) were common imaging manifestations in chest CT scans. One hundred patients (9.9%) were transferred to designated hospitals due to aggravation of illness. Diarrhoea emerged in 152 of 1012 patients (15.0%). Male, older age, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chills, dyspnoea, So(2) value of \u226493%, white blood cell counts of \u003E10 \u00D7 10(9)/L and large consolidated opacities on CT images were all risk factors for aggravation of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Non-critically ill individuals had different clinical characteristics from critically ill individuals. Asymptomatic infections only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19. Although with a low incidence, diarrhoea was observed in patients with COVID-19, indicating the possibility of faecal\u2013oral transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, X.; Fang, J.; Zhu, Y.; Chen, L.; Ding, F.; Zhou, R.; Ge, L.; Wang, F.; Chen, Q.; Zhang, Y.; Zhao, Q.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/076223fd75b078de66a8b2d3bc146cb4965912d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32251842/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20301774; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20301774","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ill individuals","asymptomatic individuals","clinical characteristics of patients","Asymptomatic infections","different clinical characteristics","positive SARS-CoV","RT-PCR tests","clinical course","different symptoms","aggravation of illness","small proportion of COVID","Small patchy opacities","common symptoms","Diarrhoea","large consolidated opacities","ground-glass opacities","Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital","CT images","chest CT scans","common imaging manifestations","diabetes","cardiovascular diseases","risk factors","older age","days","dyspnoea","chills","exponential increase","China","total","median duration","interquartile range","possibility of faecal","oral transmission","Male","designated hospitals","Wuhan","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","low incidence","white blood cell","value","RESULTS","exposure","end","study","OBJECTIVES","admission","hospitalization","Fever","cough"],"language":"en"},

While many of these viruses cause severe and often fatal disease in humans, bats are able to coexist with these viruses without clinical signs of disease. The mechanism conferring this antiviral response is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the differential protein expression of immortalised Pteropus alecto kidney cells (PaKiT03) following transfection with the viral mimic, Poly I:C. Two complementary proteomic approaches, difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were used to quantify changes in protein expression following Poly I:C stimulation at 4, 8 and 20 hr post treatment (hpt). RESULTS: The expression of ISG54 gene, a known responder to virus infection and Poly I:C treatment, was significantly induced in transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells. Through iTRAQ analysis we show that Poly I:C up-regulates key glycolytic enzymes at 4 hpt within PaKiT03 cells. In contrast, at 20 hpt PaKiT03 cells down-regulated ribosomal subunit proteins. The analysis with DIGE of Poly I:C transfected PaKiT03 cells showed over 215 individual spots differentially regulated, however only 25 spots could be unambiguously identified by LC-MS/MS. Immunoblotting confirmed the up-regulation of Eno1 and Tpi1 in PaKiT03 cells following Poly I:C transfection. A comparison with human cells (HEK293T and HeLa) and one additional bat cell line (PaLuT02), demonstrated that glycolytic pathways are also induced in these cell types, but at different intensities. CONCLUSION: The two techniques, DIGE and iTRAQ identified largely overlapping sets of differentially expressed proteins, however DIGE unambiguously identified significantly less proteins than iTRAQ. Poly I:C induced a rapid metabolic shift towards glycolysis within the PaKiT03 cells at 4 hpt, presumably as a consequence of increased energy requirements. On the other hand ribosomal subunit proteins were seen as down-regulated by iTRAQ, these proteins may be the limiting factors in the translational machinery available for virus replication. This study provides new insight into the antiviral response of bat cells, highlighting the importance of energy metabolism.

Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R(0). Without self-isolation, when R(0) = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4\u201350.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R(0) = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4\u201375.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moghadas, Seyed M.; Shoukat, Affan; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Wells, Chad R.; Sah, Pratha; Pandey, Abhishek; Sachs, Jeffrey D.; Wang, Zheng; Meyers, Lauren A.; Singer, Burton H.; Galvani, Alison P.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4b8db265bacb6365197af2878371ce2a56a4112.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4a7f4fc5641ee4b954a8c823c7c23858d0f9bd9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183199.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004064117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["outbreak peak","peak of outbreak","peak number of ICU beds","absence of self-isolation","proportional impact of self-isolation","epidemic peak","Hospital beds","burgeoning outbreak","outbreak trajectory","delay","hospital capacity","basic reproduction number R","symptom onset","COVID","United States","existing capacity","interquartile range","inadequacy of critical care capacity","ill individuals","treatment of patients","infected cases","scenario analyses","intensive care units","proportion of symptomatic individuals","adequacy of resources","ICUs","growing public health concern","paid sick leave","emergency mobilization","ventilators","window of time","wake of community coronavirus disease","times","severe illness","estimates","US population demographics","transmission","timing","Policies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: From January 2005 to April 2009, 1836 children (\u226415 years old) who had been admitted to Korea University Ansan Hospital were tested for acute respiratory infection. The patients who were positive for an adenovirus infection were enrolled in this study, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Adenoviruses were isolated from 310 patients. The male to female ratio was 1.6:1 and mean age was 32 \u00B1 24 months. Children under 5 years of age had the highest prevalence. In 2007, adenovirus infections occurred endemically throughout the year. The clinical diagnoses were primarily upper respiratory tract infections (45.4%), lower respiratory tract infections (48.1%), and neurologic disease (5.2%). Associated symptoms, signs and laboratory findings included fever (91.9%), cough (83.9%), pharyngeal injection (62.3%), rale (32.6%) and elevated C\u2010reactive protein (93.9%). The most common radiologic findings were perihilar and peribronchial infiltrates (42.6%). Co\u2010infections were observed in 29 cases. The mean durations of hospitalization and fever were 6.2 \u00B1 6.5 and 4.8 \u00B1 3.1 days, respectively. The lengths of hospitalization were similar for patients admitted for upper respiratory tract infections with severe morbidity and those admitted for lower respiratory tract infections.

Emerging evidence suggests that viruses require both endosomal acidification and the correct ionic balance of K\u002B and Ca2\u002B ions in endosomes for correct virus trafficking and genome release. Here, using two polyomaviruses with different capsid architectures, namely Simian virus 40 (SV40) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), we describe methods to rapidly quantify virus infection using IncuCyte ZOOM imaging analysis, and use this system to investigate the role of both K\u002B and Ca2\u002B channels during the early stages of virus entry. Using broad spectrum blockers of both K\u002B and Ca2\u002B channels to specifically target host cell ion channel functionality, we show that MCPyV, but not SV40 can be inhibited by K\u002B channel modulators, whilst both viruses are restricted by the broad spectrum Ca2\u002B channel inhibitor verapamil. Using a panel of more specific Ca2\u002B blockers, we show that both MCPyV and SV40 are dependent on the activity of two-pore Ca2\u002B channels (TPCs), as the TPC-specific blocker tetrandrine could prevent the capsid disassembly and nuclear transport required for virus entry. We therefore reveal a novel target to restrict the entry of polyomaviruses, which given the known role of TPCs during endolysosomal-ER fusion, is likely to be applicable to other viruses that transit this pathway.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dobson, Samuel J.; Mankouri, Jamel; Whitehouse, Adrian","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205714.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302333?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389733/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220302333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Merkel"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific Ca2","virus infection","Simian virus","pore Ca2","broad spectrum Ca2","correct virus trafficking","early stages of virus entry","channels","entry of polyomaviruses","MCPyV","SV40","broad spectrum blockers","channel modulators","endolysosomal-ER fusion","channel inhibitor verapamil","known role of TPCs","host cell ion channel functionality","capsid disassembly","endolysosomal network","novel target","correct ionic balance","different capsid architectures","Merkel cell polyomavirus","TPC-specific blocker tetrandrine","endosomes","IncuCyte ZOOM imaging analysis","endosomal acidification","members","Polyomaviridae","nuclear transport","ions","genome release","endoplasmic reticulum","activity","system","methods","Abstract","panel","Emerging evidence","cytoplasm","capsids","nucleus","pathway"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: \u201Ccommunity-acquired pneumonia\u201D AND \u201Cchild\u201D AND \u201Cetiology\u201D OR \u201Cdiagnosis\u201D OR \u201Cseverity\u201D OR \u201Cantibiotic\u201D. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \u226496%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin \u003C0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77\u201398%) and 93% (90\u201399%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation \u003C90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) offers a new tool with potential therapeutic applications for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Given the importance of sequence identity in the effectiveness of siRNA and the heterogeneity of HBV sequences among different isolates, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmid, pSuper/HBVS1, was developed to target a region conserved among major HBV genotypes and assess its effectiveness control of HBV. Methods HBV replication-competent plasmid was cotransfected with pSuper/HBVS1 to HuH-7 cells or to mice. The levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA were examined in transfected cells and animals. The effects of pSuper/HBVS1 on clinical isolates with genotypes B and C were also determined. Results pSuper/HBVS1 significantly decreased levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA for HBV genotype A in cell culture and in mice. Comparable suppressive effects were observed on clinical isolates of genotypes B and C. A clone with a silent mutation in the target region was identified from a patient with genotype C. This mutant revealed diminished sensitivity to pSuper/HBVS1 and could be selected out in the presence of pSuper/HBVS1 in cell culture.

We surveyed, for the first time in the order Chiroptera, the genetic diversity within this exon in the sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata. We detected 11 alleles among 85 bats, of which 79 were sampled in one population. Pairwise comparisons revealed that interallelic sequence differences ranged between 3 and 22%, although nucleotide substitutions were not evenly distributed along the exon sequence. This was most probably the result of intragenic recombination. High levels of sequence divergence and significantly more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions (d(N)/d(S)\u003E1) suggest long-term balancing selection.

Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process. METHODS: The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, \u201Cin our practice\u201D statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. RESULTS: The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 49 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, \u201Cin our practice\u201D statements were provided. In addition, 52 research priorities were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiss, Scott L.; Peters, Mark J.; Alhazzani, Waleed; Agus, Michael S.

We wished to determine the potential for pulmonary overexpression of the extracellular isoform of superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) to reduce the severity of endotoxin-induced lung injury. METHODS: Animals were randomly allocated to undergo intratracheal instillation of (1) surfactant alone (vehicle); (2) adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing a null transgene (AAV-null); and (3) adeno-associated virus vectors containing the EC-SOD transgene (AAV-EC-SOD) and endotoxin was subsequently administered intratracheally. Two additional groups were randomized to receive (1) vehicle or (2) AAV-EC-SOD, and to undergo sham (vehicle) injury. The severity of the lung injury was assessed in all animals 24 h later. RESULTS: Endotoxin produced a severe lung injury compared to sham injury. The AAV vector encoding EC-SOD increased lung EC-SOD concentrations, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the lung. EC-SOD overexpression decreased the severity of endotoxin-induced ALI, reducing the decrement in systemic oxygenation and lung compliance, decreasing lung permeability and decreasing histologic injury. EC-SOD attenuated pulmonary inflammation, decreased bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts, and reduced interleukin-6 and CINC-1 concentrations. The AAV vector itself did not contribute to inflammation or to lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary overexpression of EC-SOD protects the lung against endotoxin-induced ALI.

However, no data are available on the alveolar presence and time course of CD4\u002B CD25 \u002B Foxp3 \u002B T-regulatory lymphocyte cells (Tregs) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accordingly, we (1) measured the ratio of CD4 \u002B CD25 \u002B Foxp3 \u002B Tregs to all (CD4\u002B) lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of ARDS patients and of control subjects without lung disease and (2) assessed their impact on 30-day mortality. METHODS: In a prospective study, the ratios of CD4 \u002B CD25 \u002B Foxp3 \u002B T-regulatory cells to all CD4\u002B cells were measured (FACS) within 24 h of the patients\u2019 ICU referral in the BAL and in the blood of 47 patients with ARDS (32 males, 15 females; mean age 44 years \u00B113) as well as in 8 controls undergoing elective abdominal surgery (5 men, 3 women; mean age 49 years \u00B14). BAL concentrations of several cytokines were also measured in ARDS patients. RESULTS: Tregs were detected in the BAL of control subjects and ARDS patients. However, the mean ratio of Tregs to all CD4\u002B lymphocytes was threefold greater in ARDS non-survivors (16.5 %; p = 0.025) and almost twofold greater in ARDS survivors (9.0 %; p = 0.015) compared to controls (5.9 %).

METHODS: Twelve critically ill pregnant and postpartum women were included in this retrospective observational study on the application of ECMO for the treatment of severe ARDS refractory to standard treatment. The study was conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients treated with ECMO, 7 (58%) were pregnant and 5 (42%) were postpartum. Their median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 29 (26\u201333) years, 6 (50%) were obese. Two patients were initially treated with veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. All others received veno-venous (VV) ECMO with one or two drainage cannulae. ECMO circuit-related complications were rare, circuit change was needed in only two cases and there was no sudden circuit failure. On the other hand, bleeding was common, leading to relatively large volumes of packed red blood cell transfusion (median [IQR] volume transfused was 3,499 [1,451\u20134,874] ml) and was the main cause of death (three cases). Eight (66%) patients survived to discharge and seven were ambulant, with normal oxygen saturations. The survival rate of infants whose mothers received ECMO was 71% and surviving infants were discharged home with no sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ECMO for severe ARDS in pregnant and postpartum women was associated with a 66% survival rate. The most common cause of death was bleeding. Infants delivered of mothers who had received ECMO had a 71% survival rate and, like their mothers, had no permanent sequelae at hospital discharge.

Primary hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder with an allele frequency greater than 10% in individuals of European ancestry, while hemosiderosis is less common but associated with a much higher morbidity and mortality. Iron overload leads to iron deposition in many tissues especially the liver, brain, heart and endocrine tissues. Elevated cardiac iron leads to diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy, and is the primary determinant of survival in patients with secondary iron overload as well as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary hemochromatosis patients. In addition, iron-induced cardiac injury plays a role in acute iron toxicosis (iron poisoning), myocardial ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, Friedreich ataxia and neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with iron overload also routinely suffer from a range of endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus and anterior pituitary dysfunction. Despite clear connections between elevated iron and clinical disease, iron transport remains poorly understood. While low-capacity divalent metal and transferrin-bound transporters are critical under normal physiological conditions, L-type Ca(2\u002B) channels (LTCC) are high-capacity pathways of ferrous iron (Fe(2\u002B)) uptake into cardiomyocytes especially under iron overload conditions. Fe(2\u002B) uptake through L-type Ca(2\u002B) channels may also be crucial in other excitable cells such as pancreatic beta cells, anterior pituitary cells and neurons. Consequently, LTCC blockers represent a potential new therapy to reduce the toxic effects of excess iron.","publish_time":"2006-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oudit, Gavin Y.; Trivieri, Maria G.; Khaper, Neelam; Liu, Peter P.; Backx, Peter H.","journal":"J Mol Med (Berl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c5a34f395f84182f69fbf12b2533994da674185.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elevated iron","iron poisoning","iron deposition","iron transport","iron overload conditions","secondary iron overload","acute iron toxicosis","Excessive body iron","Elevated cardiac iron leads","toxic effects of excess iron","high-capacity pathways of ferrous iron","primary hemochromatosis patients","anterior pituitary cells","excitable cells","cardiac injury","anterior pituitary dysfunction","primary determinant of survival","hemosiderosis","mortality","type Ca","channels","uptake","pancreatic beta cells","normal physiological conditions","reperfusion injury","diastolic dysfunction","LTCC blockers","endocrine tissues","higher morbidity","common genetic disorder","leading cause of morbidity","low-capacity divalent metal","transferrin-bound transporters","myocardial ischemia","Friedreich ataxia","clinical disease","diabetes mellitus","arrhythmias","role","potential new therapy","dilated cardiomyopathy","allele frequency greater","liver","brain","neurodegenerative diseases","clear connections","heart","individuals of European ancestry","range of endocrinopathies","neurons","cardiomyocytes","addition","epidemic levels"],"language":"en"},

The successful management of cancer patients in the intensive care unit requires specific knowledge of the intensive care physician and an excellent cooperation with the treating hematologist and oncologist.","publish_time":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schellongowski, P.; Staudinger, T.","journal":"Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a300b650eec3b95e0a646b2074b2745b2b0fa907.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozc1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intensive care unit","prognosis of cancer patients","ill cancer patients","intensive care physician","successful management of cancer patients","specific knowledge","specific prognostic","specific topics","excellent cooperation","example","prevalence of malignant diseases","common organ dysfunction","importance of correct patient selection","admission","life expectancy","treating hematologist","therapeutic characteristics","risk factors","acute respiratory failure","reasons","oncologist","increase","decades","mortality","rise","article"],"language":"en"},

There is still a critical need regarding the number of available donor organs. Presently, one out of six patients dies on the waiting list. In order to identify suitable candidates for transplantation a number of criteria require consideration. These include the exact etiology of the pulmonary or cardiac disease, but also patient age, physical mobility, nutritional and muscular status as well as a comprehensive assessment to exclude significant extra-pulmonary co-morbidities. Complications arising after transplantation occur because of general perioperative risks, but also as a result of specific issues such as acute or chronic graft rejection, airway stenoses, infections of the newly immunosuppressed patient as well as a complete spectrum of secondary extra-pulmonary conditions. Comprehensive follow-up care in lung transplantation patients remains a vital issue.

This measure raises ethical issues that require documentation of the modalities of quarantine at the field level and its social effects for contact persons. In Senegal, 74 people were in contact with the Ebola case coming from Guinea in September 2014. Of these, 34 members of the case\u2019s household were contained together at home and monitored by officers. The remaining 40 health care workers from two facilities were dispersed in their family households and monitored by telephone or during doctors\u2019 visits. The study is based on in-depth interviews with 43 adult contacts about their experiences and perceptions, with additional observation for interpretation and contextualization. Containment at home was applied differently to contacts who lived with patient zero than to professional health care contacts. No coercion was used at first since all contacts adhered to surveillance, but some of them did not fully comply with movement restrictions. Contacts found biosafety precautions stigmatizing, especially during the first days when health workers and contacts were feeling an acute fear of contagion. The material support that was provided\u2014food and money\u2014was necessary since contacts could not work nor get resources, but it was too limited and delayed. The relational support they received was appreciated, as well as the protection from stigmatization by the police and follow-up workers. But the information delivered to contacts was insufficient, and some of them, including health workers, had little knowledge about EVD and Ebola transmission, which caused anxiety and emotional suffering. Some contacts experienced the loss of their jobs and loss of income; several could not easily or fully return to their previous living routines. Beyond its recommendations to enhance support measures, the study identifies the ethical stakes of quarantine in Senegal regarding informed consent and individual autonomy, non-maleficence and benevolence, and equity and adaptation to specific situations. Nevertheless, the balance between preventive benefits and individual inconveniences of quarantine should still be evaluated from a public health perspective.","publish_time":"2016-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desclaux, A.; Ndione, A.

A variety of enzymes use NAD(\u002B) to transfer either single or multiple ADP-ribose (ADPr) moieties onto distinct amino acid substrates, often in response to DNA damage or other stresses. Poly-ADPr-glycohydrolase readily reverses poly-ADP-ribosylation induced by the DNA-damage sensor PARP1 and other enzymes, but it does not remove the most proximal ADPr linked to the target amino acid. Searches for enzymes capable of fully reversing cellular mono-ADP-ribosylation back to the unmodified state have proved elusive, which leaves a gap in the understanding of this modification. Here, we identify a family of macrodomain enzymes present in viruses, yeast and animals that reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation by acting on mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates.

We relate the main features concerning patients that were admitted during years 2009 and 2010 in our intensive care unit with an A(H1N1)v2009 infection, mainly for acute respiratory distress. Demographic, clinical, and biological data as well as given medications and outcome were prospectively collected among all PCR-confirmed influenza-infected patients. In 2009 and 2010, 25 patients met the criteria. Patients\u2019 median age was 40.4 (\u00B117.4) years. Most of them (22/25) had comorbidities such as: chronic diseases, overweight, obesity, pregnancy, and Down syndrome. Maximum bed-occupation rate was 10 days per million inhabitants. Main diagnosis for ICU admission was virus-related pneumonia. Twenty-two out of 25 patients needed mechanical ventilation, some required rescue therapies such as extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) or hi-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV), both only available in few French hospitals. Within the study period, 12 patients died (48%) mainly of multi-organ failure. Through 2009 and 2010 autumn and winter periods, for several weeks, the A(H1N1)v2009 virus infection resulted in a significant increase of workload in R\u00E9union Island ICUs. In 2010, the failure of the mass immunization campaign, particularly among the at-risk groups, led to severe cases of A(H1N1)v2009 infections, particularly among patients with comorbidities.

To reveal the genetic characteristics of CBoVs, partial or complete regions of CBoVs were sequenced. In phylogenetic trees, 8 CBoVs fell into three clusters. The CBoV strains 13D226-1, 13D250, and 14Q216 were closely related to the CBoV HK831F strain, and the CBoV 14D142 strain was related to the CBoV HK882F strain. Lastly, CBoV 13D003, 13D095, 14D193, and 14Q209 strains were related to CBoV Dis-023, Dis-040, and Dis-046 strains.

Further, the open reading frame 4 (ORF4) region was absent in these 4CBoVs, but found in the other strains, which indicates that the absence of the ORF4 region rather than a unique deletion may have an influence on the pathogenesis of CBoV in dogs.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Jeong-Won; Lee, Kyung-Hyun; Lee, Jae-Il; Lee, Myoung-Heon; Lee, Kyoung-Ki; Oem, Jae-Ku","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79aa74137a10e3cd6091f6206369af893c5f3181.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117202.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515002850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233679/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515002850; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.07.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CBoV 13D003","CBoV strains 13D226","pathogenesis of CBoV","14D193 strains","CBoV 14D142 strain","CBoV HK831F strain","CBoV HK882F strain","14Q209 strains","complete regions of CBoVs","genetic characteristics of CBoVs","Korean dogs","ORF4 region","unique deletion","13D095","canine bocavirus","canine pathogens","PCR","clinical signs","infection","13D0095","nucleotides","intestine","situ hybridization","survey","influence","13D250","open reading frame","polymerase chain reaction","different provinces","Abstract","lung samples","absence","VP2 gene","phylogenetic trees","14Q216","clusters"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are frequent complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Surgical masks are a simple and inexpensive intervention that may reduce nosocomial spread. Methods. In this prospective single-center study, we instituted a universal surgical mask policy requiring all individuals with direct contact with HSCT patients to wear a surgical mask, regardless of symptoms or season. The primary endpoint was the incidence of RVIs in the mask period (2010\u20132014) compared with the premask period (2003\u20132009). Results. RVIs decreased from 10.3% (95/920 patients) in the premask period to 4.4% (40/911) in the mask period (P \u003C .001). Significant decreases occurred after both allogeneic (64/378 [16.9%] to 24/289 [8.3%], P = .001) and autologous (31/542 [5.7%] to 16/622 [2.6%], P = .007) transplants. After adjusting for multiple covariates including season and year in a segmented longitudinal analysis, the decrease in RVIs remained significant, with risk of RVI of 0.4 in patients in the mask group compared with the premask group (0.19\u20130.85, P = .02). In contrast, no decrease was observed during this same period in an adjacent hematologic malignancy unit, which followed the same infection control practices except for the mask policy. The majority of this decrease was in parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) (8.3% to 2.2%, P \u003C .001). Conclusions. Requiring all individuals with direct patient contact to wear a surgical mask is associated with a reduction in RVIs, particularly PIV3, during the most vulnerable period following HSCT.","publish_time":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Anthony D.; Sung, Julia A.

First and foremost, the spread of cross-border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest, just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes. At the same time, Global Health has become a major area of philanthropic action. Despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades, the complex collective term \u201CGlobal Health\u201D still lacks a uniform use today. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of Global Health, and analyse their meaning and implications. The paper emphasises that the term \u201CGlobal Health\u201D goes beyond the territorial meaning of \u201Cglobal\u201D, connects local and global, and refers to an explicitly political concept. Global Health regards health as a rights-based, universal good; it takes into account social inequalities, power asymmetries, the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges. Thus, it represents the necessary continuance of Public Health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges. A growing number of international players, however, focus on public-private partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions. Moreover, the predominant Global Health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the Global North. It takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease, which is mainly characterised by non-communicable conditions, and the underlying social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross-border disease threats, Global Health must focus on the social, economic and political determinants of health. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care. Consistent health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries.

Degenerate primers allow for the PCR amplification of a wider range of viral isolates with only one set of pre-mixed primers, thus increasing amplification success rates and minimizing the necessity for genome finishing activities. To successfully select a large set of degenerate PCR primers necessary to tile across an entire viral genome and maximize their success, this process is best performed computationally. RESULTS: We have developed a fully automated degenerate PCR primer design system that plays a key role in the J. Craig Venter Institute\u2019s (JCVI) high-throughput viral sequencing pipeline. A consensus viral genome, or a set of consensus segment sequences in the case of a segmented virus, is specified using IUPAC ambiguity codes in the consensus template sequence to represent the allelic diversity of the target population. PCR primer pairs are then selected computationally to produce a minimal amplicon set capable of tiling across the full length of the specified target region. As part of the tiling process, primer pairs are computationally screened to meet the criteria for successful PCR with one of two described amplification protocols. The actual sequencing success rates for designed primers for measles virus, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus 1 and 3, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus are described, where \u003E90% of designed primer pairs were able to consistently successfully amplify \u003E75% of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Augmenting our previously developed and published JCVI Primer Design Pipeline, we achieved similarly high sequencing success rates with only minor software modifications. The recommended methodology for the construction of the consensus sequence that encapsulates the allelic variation of the targeted population and is a key step prior to designing degenerate primers is also formally described.","publish_time":"2012-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Kelvin; Shrivastava, Susmita; Brownley, Anushka; Katzel, Dan; Bera, Jayati; Nguyen, Anh Thu; Thovarai, Vishal; Halpin, Rebecca; Stockwell, Timothy B","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ed77e5ebba3c0f0b10c6e0af3e8df28b57335e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3548747.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23131097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Degenerate primers","PCR amplification","PCR primer pairs","use of degenerate PCR primers","large set of degenerate PCR primers necessary","designed primers","successful PCR","consensus viral genome","large set of viral isolates","automated degenerate PCR primer design system","consensus sequence","amplification success rates","designed primer pairs","high sequencing success rates","set of pre-mixed primers","mumps virus","measles virus","human parainfluenza virus","segmented virus","high-throughput viral sequencing pipeline","entire viral genome","actual sequencing success rates","set of consensus segment sequences","consensus template sequence","human respiratory syncytial virus","wider range of viral isolates","published JCVI Primer Design Pipeline","described amplification protocols","high-throughput environment","human metapneumovirus","target population","tiling process","specified target region","key role","allelic diversity","allelic variation","key step","targeted population","capable of tiling","Craig Venter Institute\u2019s","IUPAC ambiguity codes","length","case","minor software modifications","necessity","populations","construction","important strategy","minimal amplicon","recommended methodology","activities","criteria","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Some may be rapidly fatal; others require long-term exposure to result in illness. Some lead to short-term illness and others result in long-term complications. The universe of such agents and situations is enormous. This article summarizes some of the principal foodborne microbiological agents that clinicians and those involved with public health have to deal with. While the range of agents is broad and the list is long there are several basic mechanisms such as ingestion of preformed toxins or toxin production once a microbe is present in the intestine that facilitate sorting these agents into some logical framework. However, at the end of the day it is always key to think about ingested agents as a cause for illness, whether that illness be confined to the intestinal system or more systemic. In principle all foodborne illness is preventable and of the key messages to consumers and health care professionals is to know if you or your patient is at greater risk from foodborne illness. If one is dealing with an \u2018at risk\u2019 patient, it is important they be educated on what foods to avoid and what precautions to take to minimize the likelihood of acquiring a foodborne illness.

METHODS: This study retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was eventually excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. RESULTS: Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgG-positive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Viral serological testing is an effective means of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background Timely influenza surveillance is important to monitor influenza epidemics. Objectives (i) To calculate the epidemic threshold for influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in 19 countries, as well as the thresholds for different levels of intensity. (ii) To evaluate the performance of these thresholds. Methods The moving epidemic method (MEM) has been developed to determine the baseline influenza activity and an epidemic threshold. False alerts, detection lags and timeliness of the detection of epidemics were calculated. The performance was evaluated using a cross\u2010validation procedure. Results The overall sensitivity of the MEM threshold was 71\u00B78% and the specificity was 95\u00B75%. The median of the timeliness was 1 week (range: 0\u20134\u00B75). Conclusions The method produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics. The good balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the epidemic threshold to detect seasonal epidemics and avoid false alerts has advantages for public health purposes. This method may serve as standard to define the start of the annual influenza epidemic in countries in Europe.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vega, Tom\u00E1s; Lozano, Jose Eugenio; Meerhoff, Tamara; Snacken, Ren\u00E9; Mott, Joshua; Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul; Nunes, Baltazar","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee8a6b2db7d43dedd8668300d2e71587a3062f17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5855152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22897919/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00422.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["influenza epidemics","annual influenza epidemic","epidemic thresholds","moving epidemic method","baseline influenza activity","Background Timely influenza surveillance","detection of epidemics","MEM threshold","seasonal epidemics","False alerts","timeliness","Europe","countries","specificity","performance","detection lags","overall sensitivity","Respiratory Viruses","acute respiratory infections","advantages","illness","ILI","specific signal","public health purposes","ARI","start","Methods","week","different levels of intensity","good balance","Vega","validation procedure","median","range","standard","Conclusions","paper","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

The RNA genome is the template for synthesis of additional RNA strands. During replication of RNA viruses, there are at least three types of RNA that must be synthesized: the genome, a copy of the genome (copy genome), and mRNAs. Some RNA viruses also synthesize copies of subgenomic mRNAs. RdRp is the key player for all of these processes. RdRps of all RNA viruses probably arose from a common ancestor. The RdRp and other proteins required for viral genome synthesis are often called the replicase complex. The replicase complex consists of the set of proteins required to produce infectious genomes. In addition to the RdRp, the replicase complex may contain RNA-helicases (to unwind highly base-paired regions of the RNA genome) and NTPases (to supply energy for the polymerization process). The number of proteins in the replicase complex differs among virus families. There may also be a requirement for host cell proteins. The RNA virus group can be subdivided based on the type of RNA that serves as the genome. Positive or plus (\u002B)-strand RNA viruses have genomes that are functional mRNAs. Their genomes are translated shortly after penetration into the host cell to produce the RdRp (and other viral proteins) required for synthesis of additional viral RNAs. Positive-strand RNA viruses often use large complexes of cellular membranes for genome replication. They actively modify host cell membranes to construct viral replication scaffolds. There are three groups of RNA viruses whose genomes are not mRNAs. They are the negative- or minus-strand RNA viruses, the closely related ambisense RNA viruses, and double-stranded RNA viruses. For each of these groups of viruses, the first synthetic event after genome penetration is transcription. This is accomplished by viral proteins (including the RdRp) that enter cell with the genome.","publish_time":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Susan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8aa24707af4e8e9c45802d064dd6296cbbdacc8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173417.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031094000106; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128031094000106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA genome","replication of RNA viruses","groups of RNA viruses","RNA-helicases","types of RNA","type of RNA","Positive-strand RNA viruses","minus-strand RNA viruses","encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","related ambisense RNA viruses","double-stranded RNA viruses","RNA virus group","groups of viruses","genome replication","synthesis of additional RNA strands","viral genome synthesis","copy genome","genome penetration","viral proteins","host cell proteins","replicase complex","set of proteins","number of proteins","host cell membranes","viral replication scaffolds","infectious genomes","synthesis of additional viral RNAs","functional mRNAs","copies of subgenomic mRNAs","virus families","large complexes of cellular membranes","template","synthetic event","transcription","base-paired regions","energy","key player","requirement","NTPases","common ancestor","polymerization process","processes","RdRps"],"language":"en"},

While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K(\u002B) efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of a rapid, multipathogen respiratory panel (RP) test vs usual care (control). Patients were eligible if they were \u226512 months old, had symptoms of upper respiratory infection or influenza-like illness, and were not on antibiotics. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription; secondary outcomes included antiviral prescription, disposition, and length of stay (ClinicalTrials.gov# NCT02957136). RESULTS: Of 191 patients enrolled, 93 (49%) received RP testing; 98 (51%) received usual care. Fifty-three (57%) RP and 7 (7%) control patients had a virus detected and reported during the ED visit (P = .0001). Twenty (22%) RP patients and 33 (34%) usual care patients received antibiotics during the ED visit (\u201312%; 95% confidence interval, \u201325% to 0.4%; P = .06/0.08); 9 RP patients received antibiotics despite having a virus detected. The magnitude of antibiotic reduction was greater in children (\u201319%) vs adults (\u20139%, post hoc analysis). There was no difference in antiviral use, length of stay, or disposition. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid RP testing was associated with a trend toward decreased antibiotic use, suggesting a potential benefit from more rapid viral tests in the ED. Future studies should determine if specific groups are more likely to benefit from testing and evaluate the relative cost and effectiveness of broad testing, focused testing, and a combined diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship approach.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"May, Larissa; Tatro, Grant; Poltavskiy, Eduard; Mooso, Benjamin; Hon, Simson; Bang, Heejung; Polage, Christopher","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c88aef176b70c6b11a51028124680237a6e5abd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7043218.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32128326/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Rapid RP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RP patients","Rapid RP testing","usual care patients","control patients","antibiotic prescription","focused testing","antibiotics","ED visit","effectiveness of broad testing","decreased antibiotic use","test vs usual care","antiviral prescription","antiviral use","magnitude of antibiotic reduction","length of stay","disposition","unnecessary antibiotic treatment","virus","symptoms of upper respiratory infection","multipathogen respiratory panel","rapid viral tests","Acute upper respiratory tract infections","potential benefit","vs adults","secondary outcomes","common cause of emergency department","combined diagnostic","impact","Future studies","influenza","BACKGROUND","visits","relative cost","trend","primary outcome","specific groups","antimicrobial stewardship approach","months old","children","illness","randomized clinical trial","difference","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","NCT02957136","confidence interval","RESULTS","analysis"],"language":"en"},

In light of the International Health Regulations (IHR)(2005), this study compares the organisation of RAEW in China and the Netherlands. The respective approaches towards surveillance of arboviral disease and unexplained pneumonia were analysed to gain a better understanding of the RAEW mode of operation. This study may be used to explore options for further strengthening of global collaboration and timely detection and surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: A qualitative study design was used, combining data retrieved from the literature and from semi-structured interviews with Chinese (5 national-level and 6 provincial-level) and Dutch (5 national-level) experts. RESULTS: The results show that some differences exist such as in the use of automated electronic components of the early warning system in China (\u2018CIDARS\u2019), compared to a more limited automated component in the Netherlands (\u2018barometer\u2019). Moreover, RAEW units in the Netherlands focus exclusively on infectious diseases, while China has a broader \u2018all hazard\u2019 approach (including for example chemical incidents). In the Netherlands, veterinary specialists take part at the RAEW meetings, to enable a structured exchange/assessment of zoonotic signals. CONCLUSION: Despite these differences, the main conclusion is that for the two infections studied, the early warning system in China and the Netherlands are remarkably similar considering their large differences in infectious disease history, population size and geographical setting. Our main recommendations are continued emphasis on international corporation that requires insight into national infectious disease surveillance systems, the usage of a One Health approach in infectious disease surveillance, and further exploration/strengthening of a combined syndromic and laboratory surveillance system.","publish_time":"2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vlieg, Willemijn L.; Fanoy, Ewout B.; van Asten, Liselotte; Liu, Xiaobo; Yang, Jun; Pilot, Eva; Bijkerk, Paul; van der Hoek, Wim; Krafft, Thomas; van der Sande, Marianne A.; Liu, Qi-Yong","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3115260ab0b83020627a59f8e6c47d8e33337d3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5423001.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4319-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28482830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAEW"],"locations":["Netherlands","China"],"keyphrases":["Netherlands","surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks","national infectious disease surveillance systems","infectious disease history","surveillance of arboviral disease","China","laboratory surveillance system","infectious diseases","early warning system","national-level","RAEW meetings","organisation of RAEW","RAEW units","RAEW mode of operation","Health approach","large differences","provincial-level","main conclusion","RESULTS","International Health Regulations","qualitative study design","essential components","international corporation","structured exchange","use of automated electronic components","Risk assessment","main recommendations","semi-structured interviews","assessment of zoonotic signals","limited automated component","insight","population size","timely detection","usage","continued emphasis","global collaboration","Chinese","exploration","geographical setting","unexplained pneumonia","literature","better understanding","hazard","BACKGROUND","Dutch","respective approaches","infections","veterinary specialists","example chemical incidents","METHODS","data","options","light","IHR","CIDARS","barometer","experts"],"language":"en"},

Three commonly proposed mechanisms for the origins of viruses are: Viruses descended from primitive precellular life forms; viruses are escaped cellular genetic elements; viruses devolved from more complex intracellular parasites. None of these theories easily explains the origins of all viruses and it is widely accepted that all viruses did not share a single common ancestor. Instead, distinct lineages of viruses probably evolved by different mechanism. There is also good evidence that viruses have shaped the evolution of their hosts, for at least hundreds of millions of years. While some virologists consider the ancient origins of viruses, others examine the forces that drive virus evolution today. Examples of ongoing virus evolution include: Cross-species jumps; decreased or increased virulence; emergence of drug resistance; escape from immune responses at the level of individuals and populations. Virus evolution is the outcome of two independent events. The first is genome mutation and the second is selection. Viruses with RNA genomes tend to have high mutation rates, but some appear to be evolutionarily stable nonetheless. Viruses have distinct phenotypes. For examples, some influenza viruses are highly virulent but others are much less so; influenza viruses also differ tremendously in their ability to be transmitted. Modern studies of virus genetics seek to correlate diverse phenotypes with specific genes and sequences. The ability to do reverse genetics is key to understanding viral genes. Reverse genetics involves cloning viral genomes, designing specific mutation, and introducing the mutated genomes back into cells to produce infectious particles whose phenotypes can then be measured.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Susan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128031094000088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031094000088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","related viruses","Abstract Viruses","ancient origins of viruses","distinct lineages of viruses","Examples of ongoing virus evolution","viral genomes","reverse genetics","diverse phenotypes","specific mutation","distinct phenotypes","Modern studies of virus genetics","mutated genomes","RNA genomes","viral genes","specific genes","genome mutation","ability","high mutation rates","different types of organisms","domains of life","different mechanism","primitive precellular life forms","emergence of drug resistance","immune responses","escape","increased virulence","Cross-species jumps","cellular genetic elements","cells","level of individuals","outcome","ecosystems","sequences","infectious particles","complex intracellular parasites","hundreds of millions","hosts","proposed mechanisms","virologists","forces","single common ancestor","independent events","good evidence","years","populations","selection","theories"],"language":"en"},

The high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a need to explore the possible age\u2010related phenomena with non\u2010human primate models. METHODS: Three 3\u20105 years old and two 15 years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X\u2010ray, histopathological changes and immune response. RESULTS: Viral replication of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14 days after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 challenge. Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia.

However the animal-to-human spillover events that lead to emerging diseases are rarely observed or clinically examined, and the link between specific interactions and spillover risk is poorly understood. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted biological-behavioral surveillance among rural residents in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong districts of Southern China, where we have identified a number of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. Serum samples were tested for four bat-borne coronaviruses using newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Survey data were used to characterize associations between human-animal contact and bat coronavirus spillover risk. A total of 1,596 residents were enrolled in the study from 2015 to 2017. Nine participants (0.6%) tested positive for bat coronaviruses. 265 (17%) participants reported severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and/or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in the past year, which were associated with poultry, carnivore, rodent/shrew, or bat contact, with variability by family income and district of residence. This study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover in rural communities in Southern China. The low seroprevalence observed in this study suggests that bat coronavirus spillover is a rare event. Nonetheless, this study highlights associations between human-animal interaction and zoonotic spillover risk. These findings can be used to support targeted biological behavioral surveillance in high-risk geographic areas in order to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hongying; Mendelsohn, Emma; Zong, Chen; Zhang, Wei; Hagan, Emily; Wang, Ning; Li, Shiyue; Yan, Hong; Huang, Huimin; Zhu, Guangjian; Ross, Noam; Chmura, Aleksei; Terry, Philip; Fielder, Mark; Miller, Maureen; Shi, Zhengli; Daszak, Peter","journal":"Biosafety and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f5c01b714e95fe977701645bfad1f814a20faa5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300308; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong","Southern China"],"keyphrases":["bat coronavirus spillover risk","bat coronaviruses","bat contact","zoonotic spillover risk","human spillover events","serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover","human-animal contact","human-animal interaction","bat-origin viral diseases","primary risk factor","Abstract Human interaction","study highlights associations","risk of zoonotic disease emergence","biological-behavioral surveillance","rural residents","related coronaviruses","participants","targeted biological behavioral surveillance","rural communities","Guangdong districts of Southern China","emerging diseases","high-risk geographic areas","Yunnan","Guangxi","order","high impact zoonoses","developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","family income","SARI","severe acute respiratory infections","rodent","shrew","variability","symptoms","poultry","ELISA","animals","specific interactions","rare event","past year","district of residence","number of SARS","illness","influenza","carnivore","bats","Survey data","low seroprevalence","phenomenon","Serum samples","findings","total"],"language":"en"},

This chapter will highlight studies showing how plant viruses recruit nucleolar functions to facilitate virus translation and replication, virus movement and assembly of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, and to counteract plant host defense responses.

Adequate methods for monitoring immune suppression status are lacking. Here, we evaluated quantification of torque teno virus (TTV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as biomarkers for defining the net state of immunosuppression in lung-transplanted patients. METHODS: This prospective single-center study included 98 patients followed for 2 years after transplantation. Bacterial infections, fungal infections, viral respiratory infections (VRTI), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and acute rejections, as well as TTV and EBV levels, were monitored. RESULTS: The levels of torque teno virus DNA increased rapidly after transplantation, likely due to immunosuppressive treatment. A modest increase in levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was also observed after transplantation. There were no associations between either TTV or EBV and infectious events or acute rejection, respectively, during follow-up. When Tacrolimus was the main immunosuppressive treatment, TTV DNA levels were significantly elevated 6\u201324 months after transplantation as compared with Cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although replication of TTV, but not EBV, appears to reflect the functionality of the immune system, depending on the type of immunosuppressive treatment, quantification of TTV or EBV as biomarkers has limited potential for defining the net state of immune suppression.","publish_time":"2018-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nord\u00E9n, Rickard; Magnusson, Jesper; Lundin, Anna; Tang, Ka-Wei; Nilsson, Staffan; Lindh, Magnus; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Riise, Gerdt C; Westin, Johan","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3725ca2fdaeaaf188c63878e4c6263408e52aa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5888719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29644247/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV levels","TTV DNA levels","quantification of TTV","lung transplantation","replication of TTV","Barr virus DNA","levels of Epstein","levels of torque teno virus DNA","Epstein-Barr virus","main immunosuppressive treatment","type of immunosuppressive treatment","quantification of torque teno virus","Cyclosporine treatment","net state of immune suppression","fungal infections","Bacterial infections","acute rejections","biomarkers","immune suppression status","immune system","viral respiratory infections","lung-transplanted patients","net state of immunosuppression","infectious events","infectious complications","Adequate methods","VRTI","survival","cytomegalovirus","CMV","Major hurdles","prospective single-center study","viremia","potential","modest increase","BACKGROUND","Tacrolimus","functionality","RESULTS","follow-up","months","CONCLUSIONS","years","associations"],"language":"en"},

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 637 cases were reported in fifteen countries, including 378 deaths, corresponding to a case fatality rate of nearly 60% [19]. Avian influenza continues to be one of the deadliest diseases that jumps from animals to humans. Epidemiologists believe that it is likely to cause the next major global pandemic that could kill millions of people. The 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated that international air travel can significantly influence the global spread of an infectious disease. This paper studies the effects of air travel on the spread of avian influenza from Asian and Australian cities to the United States. A two-city mathematical model involving a pandemic strain is used to derive the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ), which determines if the disease will spread and persist ( R 0 \u003E 1 ) or go extinct ( R 0 \u003C 1 ). Real air travel data is used to model the disease spread by individuals who are susceptible to or are infected with pandemic avian influenza. Analysis of the two-city model helps understand the dynamics of the spread of pandemic influenza when the cities are connected by air travel. Understanding these effects can help public health officials and policy-makers select the appropriate disease control measures. Also, it can provide guidance to decision-makers on where to implement control measures while conserving precious resources.","publish_time":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuncer, Necibe; Le, Trang","journal":"International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44214fe541292ce06126fd3af6506c7ded13cc0d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874548214000079; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874548214000079","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Hong Kong","United States"],"keyphrases":["spread of pandemic influenza","spread of avian influenza","pandemic avian influenza","severe disease","global spread","effects of air travel","pathogenic avian influenza","pandemic strain","international air travel","infectious disease","appropriate disease control measures","Real air travel data","city model","major global pandemic","humans","city mathematical model","policy-makers","Australian cities","strain H5N1","decision-makers","public health officials","World Health Organization","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","HPAI","dynamics","bird","human transmission","high mortality","paper studies","United States","basic reproduction number","deaths","animals","precious resources","millions of people","case fatality rate","Hong Kong","deadliest diseases","cases","countries","total","guidance","individuals","Analysis","Epidemiologists"],"language":"en"},

Cats infected with Mhf that clear bacteremia are protected from Mhf reinfection, but the mechanisms of protective immunity are unresolved. In the present study we investigated whether the passive transfer of antibodies from Mhf-recovered cats to na\u00EFve recipient cats provided protection against bacteremia and clinical disease following homologous challenge with Mhf; moreover, we characterized the immune response in the recipient cats. Ten specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats were transfused with pooled plasma from cats that had cleared Mhf bacteremia; five control cats received plasma from na\u00EFve SPF cats. After homologous challenge with Mhf, cats were monitored for 100 days using quantitative PCR, hematology, blood biochemistry, Coombs testing, flow cytometry, DnaK ELISA, and red blood cell (RBC) osmotic fragility (OF) measurement. Passively immunized cats were not protected against Mhf infection but, compared to control cats, showed significantly higher RBC OF and B lymphocyte (CD45R/B220(\u002B)) counts and occasionally higher lymphocyte, monocyte and activated CD4(\u002B) T lymphocyte (CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B)) counts; they also showed higher bilirubin, total protein and globulin levels compared to those of control cats. At times of peak bacteremia, a decrease in eosinophils and lymphocytes, as well as subsets thereof (B lymphocytes and CD5(\u002B), CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes), and an increase in monocytes were particularly significant in the passively immunized cats. In conclusion, passive immunization does not prevent bacteremia and clinical disease following homologous challenge with Mhf, but enhances RBC osmotic fragility and induces a pronounced immune response.

Outbreaks of new pathogens are often ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meehan, Michael T.; Cope, Robert C.; McBryde, Emma S.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da4d9fd9673c937311cc269e5851ac2cc3100a4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094110.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110109; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319304783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816294/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319304783","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new strain","invading strain","background endemic strain","existing endemic strain","novel disease strain","past instances of successful strain invasion","thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions","emergence","past work","fit novel strains","Outbreaks of new pathogens","epidemic outbreaks","wild-type strains","valuable lessons","imminent threat","probability","transmission of mutant variants","survival prospects","magnitude","populations","Abstract Pathogen evolution","reproduction number relative","branching process approximation","order","global health","stochastic dynamics","accompanying findings","understanding","differential control scenarios","ratio","considerable attention","modelling communities","critical determinant","mechanisms","analogy","analysis","circumstances","community"],"language":"en"},

We estimated the effective vaccination rate for the population, with basic reproduction number (R(0)) as the intermediate variable. Periodic EVD fluctuation was analyzed by solving a Jacobian matrix of differential equations based on a SIR (susceptible, infective, and removed) model. A comprehensive compartment model was constructed to fit and predict EVD transmission patterns, and to evaluate the effects of control and prevention measures. Effective EVD vaccination rates were estimated to be 42% (31\u201350%), 45% (42\u201348%), and 51% (44\u201356%) among susceptible individuals in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. In the absence of control measures, there would be rapid mortality in these three countries, and an EVD epidemic would be likely recur in 2035, and then again 8~9 years later. Oscillation intervals would shorten and outbreak severity would decrease until the periodicity reached ~5.3 years. Measures that reduced the spread of EVD included: early diagnosis, treatment in isolation, isolating/monitoring close contacts, timely corpse removal, post-recovery condom use, and preventing or quarantining imported cases. EVD may re-emerge within two decades without control and prevention measures.

Continuous vigilance and strengthening of infection control systems will shape the capacity to prevent and control MERS-CoV or new emerging disease transmission.","publish_time":"2017-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiboonchutikul, Surasak; Manosuthi, Weerawat; Sangsajja, Chariya","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f518c9102ffcafa861ce30bc42e565ebed69cdde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["control MERS-CoV","treatment of MERS","recent outbreaks of MERS","CoV infections","breakdown of infection control systems","Strict infection control precautions","new emerging disease transmission","previous emerging infections","New emerging pathogens","nosocomial transmission","healthcare-associated transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","number of Middle East respiratory syndrome","healthcare facilities","well-prepared hospital system","capacity","valuable lessons","global health threat","Continuous vigilance","era","Thailand","delayed diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

Abstract A critical review of articles on respiratory infections published in the last three months of 2008 to the end of 2009. There are articles on patients with bronchiectasis that study their quality of life, as well as those that analyse the decrease in the number of exacerbations due to the immunomodulatory effect of using low doses of macrolides in these patients. In the diagnosis of tuberculosis, works on the application of interferon-\u00C1 are especially relevant, whilst on the treatment of this disease, articles that study therapeutic innovations in the management of TB-MDR and TB-XDR or -TDR are also highlighted. As far as publications on pneumonia are concerned, there are those that analyse the progression of community acquired pneumonias (CAP) in patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, special importance is given to the initial epidemiological and clinical studies of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Also of interest is the evaluation of prognostic scales as predictors of ventilation support and/or the use of pressor amines, as well as the use of biological markers to complement the predictive value of these prognostic scales. Aetiological and clinical studies of pneumonias associated with the health system continue to be of great interest and their possible differences compared to CAPs. Also of interest in the treatment of the pneumonias, is the analysis of the potential inflammation modulatory ability of different drugs.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Souza-Galvao, Mar\u00EDa Luisa; Mart\u00EDnez-Garc\u00EDa, Miguel \u00C1ngel; Sanz, Francisco; Blanquer, Jos\u00E9","journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d327b7e62990004c3cf31d6dffbd752cc3c2077f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030028961070003X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030028961070003X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["En los pacientes","En cuanto","mientras que en","neumon\u00EDas adquiridas en","en pacientes afectados","as\u00ED como los que analizan","los art\u00EDculos sobre infecciones respiratorias publicados en","son interesantes los an\u00E1lisis","esta afecci\u00F3n destacan los art\u00EDculos que estudian innovaciones terap\u00E9uticas en","los marcadores biol\u00F3gicos como complemento","dosis bajas en estos pacientes","TB-MDR y TB-XDR o -TDR","son especialmente relevantes los trabajos sobre","tratamiento","patients","Siguen teniendo gran inter\u00E9s los estudios etiol\u00F3gicos y cl\u00EDnicos","cobran especial relevancia los estudios iniciales epidemiol\u00F3gicos y cl\u00EDnicos","soporte ventilatorio y","neumon\u00EDas asociadas","son llamativas","management of TB","Tambi\u00E9n son","clinical studies of pneumonias","escalas pron\u00F3sticas como predictoras","bronquiectasias destacan art\u00EDculos que estudian su calidad","uso","NAC","H1N1","treatment","salud y sus posibles diferencias respecto","citadas escalas pron\u00F3sticas","evaluation of prognostic scales","critical review of articles","exacerbaciones por","diagnosis of tuberculosis","pandemia por gripe","use of biological markers","use of pressor amines","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","vida","aplicaci\u00F3n","valor predictivo","macr\u00F3lidos","sistema","\u00FAltimo trimestre","n\u00FAmero","interfer\u00F3n gamma","disminuci\u00F3n","probable capacidad moduladora","utilizaci\u00F3n","valoraci\u00F3n","evoluci\u00F3n","comunidad","aminas presoras","efecto inmunomodulador","enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cr\u00F3nica","Resumen Revisi\u00F3n cr\u00EDtica","potential inflammation modulatory ability of different drugs","publicaciones referidas","immunomodulatory effect","inflamaci\u00F3n","analysis","predictive value","predictors of ventilation support","influenza","Asimismo","therapeutic innovations","low doses of macrolides","respiratory infections","bronchiectasis","diagn\u00F3stico","number of exacerbations","diversos f\u00E1rmacos","health system","presente a\u00F1o","possible differences","application of interferon","progression of community","special importance","quality of life","CAPs","months","decrease","pandemic","publications"],"language":"en"},

The public availability of methods for dual-use genetic engineering, coupled with the insider threat, poses an unprecedented risk for biosecurity. Case studies including the 1984 Rajneesh salmonella bioterrorism attack and the controversy over engineered transmissible H5N1 influenza are analyzed. Simple probability analysis shows that the risks of dual-use research are likely to outweigh potential benefits, yet this type of analysis has not been done to date. Many bioterrorism agents may also occur naturally. Distinguishing natural from unnatural epidemics is far more difficult than other types of terrorism. Public health systems do not have mechanisms for routinely considering bioterrorism, and an organizational culture that is reluctant to consider it. A collaborative model for flagging aberrant outbreak patterns and referral from the health to security sectors is proposed. Vulnerabilities in current approaches to biosecurity need to be reviewed and strengthened collaboratively by all stakeholders.

This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because cross-reactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes.","publish_time":"2016-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Christopher; Ortiz, Kristina; Ansari, Aftab; Gershwin, M.

Using a specific monoclonal antibody, we demonstrated that the 3a protein displayed a punctate cytoplasmic localization in Drosophila as in SARS-CoV-infected cells. We provide genetic evidence to support that 3a is functionally related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We further found that 3a misexpression induces apoptosis, which could be modulated by cellular cytochrome c levels and caspase activity. From a forward genetic screen, 78 dominant 3a modifying loci were recovered and the identity of these modifiers revealed that the severity of the 3a-induced rough eye phenotype depends on multiple cellular processes including gene transcriptional regulation.","publish_time":"2005-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, S.

Methods: We used microarray datasets from NCBI GEO Dataset databases and conducted a comprehensive data mining analyses, where we studied the gene expression of 299 cell death regulators that regulate 13 different cell death types (cell death regulatome) in cells treated with LIUS. Results: We made the following findings: (1) LIUS exerts a profound effect on the expression of cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. Of note, LIUS has the tendency to downregulate the gene expression of cell death regulators in non-cancer cells. Most of the cell death regulator genes downregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells are responsible for mediating inflammatory signaling pathways; (2) LIUS activates different cell death transcription factors in cancer and non-cancer cells. Transcription factors TP-53 and SRF- were induced by LIUS exposure in cancer cells and non-cancer cells, respectively; (3) As two well-accepted mechanisms of LIUS, mild hyperthermia and oscillatory shear stress induce changes in the expression of cell death regulators, therefore, may be responsible for inducing LIUS mediated changes in gene expression patterns of cell death regulators in cells; (4) LIUS exposure may change the redox status of the cells. LIUS may induce more of antioxidant effects in non-cancer cells compared to cancer cells; and (5) The genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells have distinct chromatin long range interaction (CLRI) patterns to that of non-cancer cells. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests novel molecular mechanisms that may be utilized by LIUS to induce tumor suppression and inflammation inhibition. Our findings may lead to development of new treatment protocols for cancers and chronic inflammation.","publish_time":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiwei; Lai, Bin; Nanayakkara, Gayani; Yang, Qian; Sun, Yu; Lu, Yifan; Shao, Ying; Yu, Daohai; Yang, William Y.; Cueto, Ramon; Fu, Hangfei; Zeng, Huihong; Shen, Wen; Wu, Susu; Zhang, Chunquan; Liu, Yanna; Choi, Eric T.; Wang, Hong; Yang, Xiaofeng","journal":"Front Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23dcdd1995567d482009f9eafaffc887da09701d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6640725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355136/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2019.00600","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI GEO","LIUS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-cancer cells","LIUS exposure","expression of cell death regulatome","gene expression of cell death regulators","gene expression patterns of cell death regulators","different cell death types","cell death regulator genes","different cell death transcription factors","inducing LIUS mediated changes","well-accepted mechanisms of LIUS","suppression of inflammation","chronic inflammation","inflammation inhibition","Transcription factors TP","novel molecular mechanisms","tumor suppression","following findings","mild hyperthermia","distinct chromatin long range interaction","CLRI","NCBI GEO Dataset databases","oscillatory shear stress","microarray datasets","cancers","development of new treatment protocols","low intensity ultrasound","SRF","comprehensive data mining analyses","antioxidant effects","profound effect","analysis","tendency","redox status","Conclusions","Background","pathways","Methods","Results","tumorigenesis","note"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, assuming the existence of allochthonous inputs for intermediate predator, a food chain model is formulated with disease in the prey. The stability and persistence conditions of the equilibrium points are determined. Extinction criterion for infected prey population is obtained. It is shown that suitable amount of allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator can control infectious disease of prey population, provided initial intermediate predator population is above a critical value. This critical intermediate population size increases monotonically with the increase of infection rate. It is also shown that control of infectious disease of prey is possible in some cases of seasonally varying contact rate. Dynamical behaviours of the model are investigated numerically through one and two parameter bifurcation analysis using MATCONT 2.5.1 package.

Food products of animal origin are considered as common carriers of E. coli. This study was undertaken to identify enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) pathotypes in animal-source foods (ASF). METHODS: A total of 222 ASF samples were investigated. Based on the culture and biochemical tests, 109 E. coli isolates were identified. Duplex-polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect ETEC and EPEC. The target genes selected for each category were the lt and st for the ETEC, and eae and bfp for the EPEC isolates. RESULTS: The occurrence of E. coli in dairy and meat products was 45 and 52.5 per cent, respectively. Among the E. coli isolates, two ETEC, one typical EPEC and three atypical EPEC were detected in meat samples, whereas only one typical EPEC and one atypical EPEC were detected in dairy samples. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed presence of ETEC and EPEC strains in ASFs. The milk without pasteurization and traditional dairy products produced in unhygienic conditions are most likely the main sources of E. coli pathotypes and other zoonotic pathogens and thus can be considered a potential hazard to the health of the community.","publish_time":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abri, Ramin; Javadi, Afshin; Asghari, Roghayeh; Razavilar, Vadood; Salehi, Taghi Zahraei; Safaeeyan, Firouzeh; Rezaee, Mohammad Ahangarzadeh","journal":"Indian J Med Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6798612.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_2019_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571634/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["ASF","ETEC","EPEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli isolates","EPEC isolates","coli pathotypes","EPEC strains","atypical EPEC","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli strains","presence of ETEC","dairy samples","meat products","meat samples","ASF samples","traditional dairy products","RESULTS","Food products of animal origin","common carriers of","common agents of diarrhoea","animal-source foods","enteropathogenic","unhygienic conditions","OBJECTIVES","Duplex-polymerase chain reaction assay","main sources of","milk","pasteurization","BACKGROUND","biochemical tests","eae","bfp","developing countries","category","health","CONCLUSIONS","total","zoonotic pathogens","occurrence of","ASFs","potential hazard","target genes","community","culture","METHODS","INTERPRETATION","study","cent"],"language":"en"},

Microbes responsible are diverse and include Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidia. While the use of antibiotics as a treatment for bacterial infections and as a prophylactic additive in feed has dramatically improved cattle production in recent decades, the increasing pressure to reduce or eliminate use of antibiotics in animals has caused the livestock industry to seek appropriate alternatives. Antimicrobial/Host Defense Peptides are natural compounds present on skin and in secretions in plants and animals that are microbicidal for bacteria, viruses, and parasites and they stimulate the immune system to combat infectious diseases. Our objective is to establish orally-obtained Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) as an alternative to antibiotics to protect against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease in calves. We devised a method to allow the cow udder to act as a factory to produce HDPs so that suckling calves will receive a continuous oral dose of HDPs over several weeks to protect them against neonatal diarrhea. We will use Adenovirus to deliver a gene coding for several HDPs in-frame into mammary epithelial cells. The epithelial cells will secrete the HDP protein into milk to be consumed by the suckling calves and trypsin in the calf gut will release the HDPs through cleavage. Thus, the novelty of this research lies not only in the proposed alternative to antibiotics to protect neonates against disease, but in the method by which we introduce the peptides to the suckling offspring.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Heather L.; Buchanan, Rachelle M.; Allan, Brenda; Tikoo, Suresh K.","journal":"Procedia in Vaccinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b7fb5649e2f9af2ddf25af42c883bb3d698fba4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288917/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877282X12000070; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877282X12000070; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.provac.2012.04.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Antimicrobial/Host Defense Peptides","HDP"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["use of antibiotics","suckling calves","Host Defense Peptides","Abstract Neonatal Diarrheal Disease","continuous oral dose of HDPs","animals","suckling offspring","method","mammary epithelial cells","livestock industries","livestock industry","Microbes responsible","proposed alternative","significant economic losses","improved cattle production","Salmonella","recent decades","Escherichia coli","natural compounds","prophylactic additive","Rotavirus","feed","skin","bacterial infections","weeks","frame","calf gut","increasing pressure","immune system","parasites","Coronavirus","microbicidal","plants","secretions","Canada","HDP protein","trypsin","treatment","factory","neonates","gene coding","infectious diseases","viruses","Cryptosporidia","cow udder","appropriate alternatives","milk","research","Adenovirus","world","cleavage","novelty","objective"],"language":"en"},

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antagonizes BST2 through viral protein u (Vpu), which downregulates BST2 from the cell surface. We report the crystal structure of a protein complex containing Vpu and BST2 cytoplasmic domains and the core of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1). This, together with our biochemical and functional validations, reveals how Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathways to mistraffick BST2. Vpu mimics a canonical acidic dileucine-sorting motif to bind AP1 in the cytosol, while simultaneously interacting with BST2 in the membrane. These interactions enable Vpu to build on an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, presumably causing the observed retention of BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and stimulating its degradation in lysosomes. The ability of Vpu to hijack AP-dependent trafficking pathways suggests a potential common theme for Vpu-mediated downregulation of host proteins.

Recently, a high dose (HD) TIV was found to increase the level of antibody response in elderly patients compared to the standard dose (SD) TIV. We hypothesized that the HD TIV would be well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the SD TIV in pediatric subjects with ALL. PROCEDURE: This was a randomized, double-blind, phase I safety and immunogenicity trial comparing the HD to the SD TIV in children with ALL. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either the HD (60\u00B5g) or the SD (15\u00B5g) TIV. Local and systemic reactions were solicited, hemagglutinin inhibition titers to influenza virus antigens were measured, and monitoring labs were collected prior to and/or after each vaccination. RESULTS: Fifty subjects were enrolled (34 HD, 16 SD). Mean age was 8.5 years; 63% were male, and 80% were in maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences reported in local or systemic symptoms. No severe adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No significant differences between the HD and SD TIV groups were noted for immune responses.

The latter are among the most common infections in human beings. In terms of the biomedical paradigm the common cold is caused by numerous respiratory viruses, whilst flu is caused by the influenza virus. Medical diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds without laboratory confirmation. Symptoms of flu include sudden onset of fever and cough, and colds are characterized by sneezing, sore throat, and runny nose, but in practice the symptoms often overlap. In this study we examine the degree by which the views of lay people with respect to both diagnosis and epidemiology diverge with that which is evident in biomedical discourse. Our results indicate that whilst most of the identified symptoms are common to lay and professional people, the former integrate symptoms into a markedly different observational frame from the latter. And as far as causation is concerned it is clear that lay people emphasize the role of \u2018resistance\u2019 and \u2018immunity\u2019 at least as much as \u2018infection\u2019 in accounting for the onset of colds and flu. The data are analyzed using novel methods that focus on the co-occurrence of concepts and are displayed as semantic networks. As well as reporting on its findings the authors draw out some implications of the study for social scientific and policy discussions concerning lay diagnosis, lay expertise and the concept of an expert patient.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prior, Lindsay; Evans, Meirion R.; Prout, Hayley","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5a2342f2be367597c69efa11ae83c1a5dc98525.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21186076/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.054; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953610007987; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953610007987","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Wales"],"keyphrases":["Symptoms of flu","lay diagnosis","views of lay people","study","older people","lay expertise","professional people","identified symptoms","common cold","common infections","Medical diagnosis","onset of colds","offer of seasonal flu vaccine","biomedical paradigm","biomedical discourse","influenza virus","sudden onset of fever","policy discussions","runny nose","implications","UK","respect","sore throat","numerous respiratory viruses","clinical grounds","sneezing","cough","South Wales","role","ways","co-occurrence of concepts","novel methods","findings","authors","laboratory confirmation","human beings","epidemiology","accounting","resistance","different observational frame","practice","terms","degree","expert patient","paper reports","semantic networks","data","reporting","interviews respondents","nature","key illnesses","immunity","causation","results"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the physiological relevance of these studies is in question. This recognition motivated scientists to formulate the effect of crowded solutions in general, and excluded volume in particular, on biochemical processes. Using polymers or proteins as crowders, it was shown that while crowding tends to significantly enhance the formation of complexes containing many subunits, dimerizations are only mildly affected. Computer simulations, together with experimental evidence, indicate soft interactions and diffusion as critical factors that operate in a concerted manner with excluded volume to modulate protein binding. Yet, these approaches do not truly mimic the cellular environment. In vivo studies may overcome this shortfall. The few studies conducted thus far suggest that in cells, binding and folding occur at rates close to those determined in dilute solutions. Obtaining quantitative biochemical information on reactions inside living cells is currently a main challenge of the field, as the complexity of the intracellular milieu was what motivated crowding research to begin with.","publish_time":"2013-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillip, Yael; Schreiber, Gideon","journal":"FEBS Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c005d5ad6c52e6a1a9282d173d996a6a770b0a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094571.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579313000264; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579313000264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23337873/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.01.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biochemical studies","dilute solutions","excluded volume","living cells","biochemical processes","dilute homogenous solutions","effect of crowded solutions","quantitative biochemical information","motivated crowding research","protein binding","recognition motivated scientists","soft interactions","experimental evidence","critical factors","diffusion","intracellular milieu","concerted manner","reactions","dense mixture of molecules","main challenge","rates close","subunits","field","Computer simulations","complexity","formation of complexes","physiological relevance","polymers","proteins","crowders","dimerizations","question","cellular environment","approaches","shortfall"],"language":"en"},

Rapid clearance of pathogens allows for a quick return to a healthy state and increased survival. Pathogen-targeted approaches to combating infection have inherent limitations, including their pathogen-specific nature, the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and poor vaccine efficacy, among others. Another way to survive an infection is to tolerate the alterations to homeostasis that occur during a disease state through a process called host tolerance or resilience, which is independent from pathogen burden. Alterations in homeostasis during infection are numerous and include tissue damage, increased inflammation, metabolic changes, temperature changes, and changes in respiration. Given its importance and sensitivity, the lung is a good system for understanding host tolerance to infectious disease. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under five worldwide. One reason for this is because when the pulmonary system is altered dramatically it greatly impacts the overall health and survival of a patient. Targeting host pathways involved in maintenance of pulmonary host tolerance during infection could provide an alternative therapeutic avenue that may be broadly applicable across a variety of pathologies. In this review, we will summarize recent findings on tolerance to host lung infection. We will focus on the involvement of innate immune responses in tolerance and how an initial viral lung infection may alter tolerance mechanisms in leukocytic, epithelial, and endothelial compartments to a subsequent bacterial infection. By understanding tolerance mechanisms in the lung we can better address treatment options for deadly pulmonary infections.","publish_time":"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crane, Meredith J.; Lee, Kayla M.; FitzGerald, Ethan S.; Jamieson, Amanda M.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6191082ec9ddfe582a3ba67622a638c0ed353bde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6024012.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29988424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host lung infection","tolerance mechanisms","maintenance of pulmonary host tolerance","initial viral lung infection","subsequent bacterial infection","host pathways","pulmonary system","pathogen burden","metabolic changes","temperature changes","pathogen-specific nature","increased survival","Pathogen-targeted approaches","disease state","homeostasis","alterations","deadly pulmonary infections","antimicrobial resistance","increased inflammation","healthy state","good system","infectious diseases","use of antimicrobial drugs","involvement of innate immune responses","better address treatment options","tissue damage","endothelial compartments","potential","leukocytic","recent findings","quick return","inherent limitations","resilience","process","poor vaccine efficacy","leading cause of death","alternative therapeutic avenue","Rapid clearance of pathogens","Pneumonia","children","overall health","patient","sensitivity","respiration","variety of pathologies","review","research","combination","importance","reason"],"language":"en"},

The classical RAS as it looked in the middle 1970s consisted of circulating renin, acting on angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which in turn was converted into angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II, still considered the main effector of RAS was believed to act only as a circulating hormone via angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. Since then, an expanded view of RAS has gradually emerged. Local tissue RAS systems have been identified in most organs. Recently, evidence for an intracellular RAS has been reported. The new expanded view of RAS therefore covers both endocrine, paracrine and intracrine functions. Other peptides of RAS have been shown to have biological actions; angiotensin 2\u20138 heptapeptide (Ang III) has actions similar to those of Ang II. Further, the angiotensin 3\u20138 hexapeptide (Ang IV) exerts its actions via insulin\u2010regulated amino peptidase receptors. Finally, angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang 1\u20137) acts via mas receptors. The discovery of another ACE2 was an important complement to this picture. The recent discovery of renin receptors has made our view of RAS unexpectedly complex and multilayered. The importance of RAS in cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated by the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers.

Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against other flaviviruses could modulate immune responses to ZIKV infection by antibody-dependent enhancement, highlighting the importance of understanding the immunogenicity of the ZIKV envelope protein. In this study, we identified a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope protein from a very large phage-display naive antibody library. These germline-like antibodies, sharing 98%\u2013100% hoLogy with their corresponding germline IGHV genes, bound ZIKV DIII specifically with high affinities. One mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the currently circulating ZIKV strains and showed a synergistic effect with another mAb, m302, in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, epitope mapping and competitive binding studies suggest that m301 and m302 bind adjacent regions of the DIII C\u2013C\u2032 loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope that is intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation.

RESULTS: The Virochip was superior in performance to DFA, showing a 19% increase in the detection of 7 respiratory viruses included in standard DFA panels, and was similar to virus-specific PCR (sensitivity 85\u201390%, specificity \u226599%, PPV 94\u201396%, NPV 97\u201398%) in the detection of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, and rhino-/enteroviruses.

OBJECTIVE: To assess NYS data sources, additional to data generated by the state public health laboratory (PHL), which could enhance influenza surveillance at the state and national level. METHODS: Potential sources of laboratory test data for influenza were analyzed for quantity and quality. Computer models, designed to assess sample sizes and the confidence of data for statistical representation of influenza activity, were used to compare PHL test data to results from clinical and commercial laboratories, reported between June 8, 2013 and May 31, 2014. RESULTS: Sample sizes tested for influenza at the state PHL were sufficient for situational awareness surveillance with optimal confidence levels, only during peak weeks of the influenza season. Influenza data pooled from NYS PHLs and clinical laboratories generated optimal confidence levels for situational awareness throughout the influenza season. For novel influenza virus detection in NYS, combined real\u2010time (rt) RT\u2010PCR data from state and regional PHLs achieved \u226585% confidence during peak influenza activity, and \u226595% confidence for most of low season and all of off\u2010season. CONCLUSIONS: In NYS, combined data from clinical, commercial, and public health laboratories generated optimal influenza surveillance for situational awareness throughout the season. Statistical confidence for novel virus detection, which is reliant on only PHL data, was achieved for most of the year.","publish_time":"2016-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Escuyer, Kay L.; Waters, Christine L.; Gowie, Donna L.; Maxted, Angie M.; Farrell, Gregory M.; Fuschino, Meghan E.; St. George, Kirsten","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c56567e91abd7957f4544c4f93d7b2d8b2131a2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5304574.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27718314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Virologic Surveillance Right Size Roadmap","NYS","PHL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza data","confidence of data","influenza season","PHL data","optimal influenza surveillance","combined data","NYS data sources","PCR data","PHL test data","peak influenza activity","evaluation of data sources","state PHL","novel influenza virus detection","statistical representation of influenza activity","Statistical confidence","situational awareness surveillance","optimal confidence levels","Influenza Virologic Surveillance Right Size Roadmap","Potential sources of laboratory test data","state public health laboratory","clinical laboratories","NYS PHLs","public health laboratories","commercial laboratories","low season","New York State Department of Health","novel virus detection","sample sizes","RESULTS","regional PHLs","peak weeks","USA release","NYSDOH","METHODS","national level","CONCLUSIONS","quantity","OBJECTIVE","Computer models","BACKGROUND","off\u2010season","quality","year"],"language":"en"},

This review is focused on members of the GBF/Gea and BIG/Sec7 subfamilies of Arf GEFs, all of which use the class I Arf proteins (Arf1-3) as substrates, and play a fundamental role in trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2014Golgi and endosomal membrane systems. Members of the GBF/Gea and BIG/Sec7 subfamilies are large proteins on the order of 200 kDa, and they possess multiple homology domains. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that both of these subfamilies of Arf GEFs have members in at least five out of the six eukaryotic supergroups, and hence were likely present very early in eukaryotic evolution. The homology domains of the large Arf1 GEFs play important functional roles, and are involved in interactions with numerous protein partners. The large Arf1 GEFs have been implicated in several human diseases. They are crucial host factors for the replication of several viral pathogens, including poliovirus, coxsackievirus, mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus. Mutations in the BIG2 Arf1 GEF have been linked to autosomal recessive periventricular heterotopia, a disorder of neuronal migration that leads to severe malformation of the cerebral cortex. Understanding the roles of the Arf1 GEFs in membrane dynamics is crucial to a full understanding of trafficking in the secretory and endosomal pathways, which in turn will provide essential insights into human diseases that arise from misregulation of these pathways.","publish_time":"2009-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bui, Quynh Trang; Golinelli-Cohen, Marie-Pierre; Jackson, Catherine L.","journal":"Mol Genet Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8dca87fa78f22310ca799b28d6cf90351f33de0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088145.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00438-009-0473-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19669794/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GBF/Gea"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["large Arf1 GEFs","Sec7 subfamilies of Arf GEFs","Arf proteins","members","large proteins","BIG2 Arf1 GEF","Gea","membrane dynamics","endosomal membrane systems","GBF","understanding of trafficking","endosomal pathways","human diseases","crucial host factors","membrane remodeling processes","multiple homology domains","eukaryotic supergroups","eukaryotic evolution","Sec7 domain ADP-ribosylation factor","mouse hepatitis coronavirus","hepatitis C virus","important functional roles","guanine nucleotide exchange factors","poliovirus","coxsackievirus","Golgi","disorder of neuronal migration","autosomal recessive periventricular heterotopia","endoplasmic reticulum","severe malformation","replication","turn","viral pathogens","fundamental role","interactions","essential insights","kDa","numerous protein partners","cerebral cortex","cell","Mutations","substrates","misregulation","class","eukaryotes","Phylogenetic analyses","review"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The assay was sensitive and specific for the detection of influenza C. Eleven of 474 (2\u00B732%) patients, all less than 10 years of age, were positive for influenza C. The strains clustered into two lineages, namely C/Kanagawa and C/Sao Paulo, based upon sequencing of the hemagglutinin\u2010esterase gene. Epidemiological data showed that a higher proportion of influenza C infections occur in younger children and during the winter months. This is the first report of the detection of influenza C in Alberta, Canada, and suggests that the detection of this virus should be included in respiratory virus testing panels.","publish_time":"2013-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pabbaraju, Kanti; Wong, Sallene; Wong, Anita; May\u2010Hadford, Jennifer; Tellier, Raymond; Fonseca, Kevin","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc0ab9e7e36f5c28b6bafc358a8236c05a1ca415.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634283.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23445084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C.

Study design Serial measurements of peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts obtained during the first year post-transplantation from 83 consecutive LTR and their correlation with both viral OI and community-acquired infections post-transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. Results LTR with a nadir CD4 T-cell count \u003C200 cells/\u03BCl had consistently lower CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts than LTR with a nadir CD4 T-cell count \u003E200 cells/\u03BCl (p \u003C0.001). In LTR with a nadir CD4 T-cell count \u003C200 cells/\u03BCl, the cumulative incidence of viral infections detected in peripheral blood and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples was higher than in LTR with a nadir CD4 T-cell count \u003E200 cells/\u03BCl (p =0.0012 and p =0.0058, respectively). A nadir CD4 T-cell count \u003C200 cells/\u03BCl within the first three months post-transplantation predicted a higher frequency of viral infectious episodes in BAL samples within the subsequent six month period (p =0.0066).

This response in dengue virus infection remains to be elucidated. Triptolide and tetrandrine, compounds derived from two commonly used Chinese herbs, both demonstrate anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects partly through modulation of COX-2 expression and, hence, may have antiviral effects. In this study, we examined, firstly, the immune response to dengue virus infection with respect to COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in human lung cells (A549), liver cells (HepG2) and dendritic cells. Secondly, we assessed the potential antiviral effects of triptolide and tetrandrine on dengue virus infection vis-\u00E0-vis expression of COX-2, PGE2, transcription factors, as well as virus production. We found that dengue virus infection enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in A549 cells, similarly to the response in dendritic cells, but not in HepG2 cells. In dengue virus-infected A549 cells, nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) were also activated, and both were dose-dependently inhibited by triptolide (0.5\u20134 ng/ml). Tetrandrine (1\u201310 \u03BCM) had no similar immunosuppressive effects and, moreover, at higher concentrations, enhanced NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 activity, COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. However, unexpectedly, tetrandrine, but not triptolide, dose-dependently suppressed dengue virus production in A549 cells, independent of PGE2 level. Our findings imply that triptolide and tetrandrine may attenuate dengue virus infection in human lung cells, but through distinct pathways.","publish_time":"2008-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liou, Jun-Ting; Chen, Zih-Yan; Ho, Ling-Jun; Yang, Shih-Ping; Chang, Deh-Ming; Liang, Chun-Chin; Lai, Jenn-Haung","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4105b546606a6e86242ddb5189633deeaf595d20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094504.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18565510/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299908004871; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.04.056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299908004871","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue virus infection","dengue virus-infected A549 cells","HepG2 cells","dendritic cells","expression of COX","suppressed dengue virus production","PGE2 production","liver cells","virus replication","virus infections","tetrandrine","human lung cells","modulation of COX","potential antiviral effects of triptolide","independent of PGE2 level","inflammatory response","immune response","enhanced NF-\u03BAB","similar immunosuppressive effects","AP","dose","nuclear factor \u03BAB","respect","subsequent prostaglandin E2","higher concentrations","activator protein","\u03BCM","activity","transcription factors","distinct pathways","Chinese herbs","pathogenesis","compounds","cycloxygenase","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

Genetically, ICH was linked with heterozygosity for an R836C mutation in the COL1A1 gene. Although an autosomal-recessive trait is also suspected, it has not been proven thus far. METHODS: A case of an infant male born to consanguineous parents is reported, presenting with classical findings, course, and clinical outcome of ICH. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in order to identify a possible underlying genetic defect. RESULTS: WES analysis revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in lysine 2 of fetuin-A, encoded by the ALPHA-2-HS-GLYCOPROTEIN (AHSG) gene (c.A4T; p.K2X). Fetuin-A is an important regulator of bone remodeling and an inhibitor of ectopic mineralization. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we show a complete deficiency of this protein in the patient\u2019s serum, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: A novel homozygous nonsense mutation in AHSG gene has been found in ICH patient with a typical phenotype, resulting in fetuin-A deficiency. This finding postulates an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance in ICH, which, unlike the autosomal-dominant inheritance associated with COL1A1, is associated with AHSG and fetuin-A deficiency.","publish_time":"2019-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merdler-Rabinowicz, Rona; Grinberg, Anna; Jacobson, Jeffrey M.; Somekh, Ido; Klein, Christoph; Lev, Atar; Ihsan, Salama; Habib, Adib; Somech, Raz; Simon, Amos J.","journal":"Pediatr Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9346985586731b6bc2104a8cad93226415df2d13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086575.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288248/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0499-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHSG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fetuin","AHSG gene","ICH patient","COL1A1 gene","clinical outcome of ICH","novel homozygous nonsense mutation","R836C mutation","autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance","autosomal-dominant inheritance","autosomal-recessive trait","complete deficiency","WES analysis","subperiosteal bone hyperplasia","important regulator of bone remodeling","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Caffey disease","inflammatory collagenopathy of infancy","ELISA","course","Infantile cortical hyperostosis","lysine","infant male","classical findings","inhibitor of ectopic mineralization","order","BACKGROUND","HS-GLYCOPROTEIN","typical phenotype","CONCLUSION","possible underlying genetic defect","consanguineous parents","patient\u2019s serum","case","RESULTS","heterozygosity","controls","METHODS","ALPHA","exome sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Among various antivirals, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are considered important passive therapeutics having an immediate effect against viral pathogens. Here we report a pseudovirus neutralization assay for rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs targeting hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 and H1N1 IAV. In this study, we generated six pseudoviruses with an HIV-1 backbone, respectively, expressing HA of four clades of H5N1 IAV and the 2009 epidemic H1N1 IAV. The resulting pseudoviruses were able to infect a variety of human and non-human cells, with 293T cells from human kidney as the most susceptible target cells. Using the established pseudovirus neutralization assay, we showed that three of ten selected mAbs specific to HA could potently neutralize infection of a pseudovirus bearing HA from the homologous IAV A/VietNam/1194/2004(H5N1) strain. This was highly consistent with the result of a microneutralization assay testing the same strain of a live IAV. Since the pseudovirus neutralization assay does not involve an infectious virus and can be performed without the requirement of a biosafety-3 laboratory, it may be applied for safe and rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs and antiviral agents targeting HA of IAVs.","publish_time":"2010-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Zhang, Xiujuan; Liu, Zhonghua; Yu, Hong; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3bd2ad4a8a6d98875cbe599529e6f4c7f3ef1a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092825.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X10010946; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X10010946","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clades of H5N1 IAV","HA of IAVs","homologous IAV","live IAV","epidemic H1N1 IAV","H1N1 influenza","established pseudovirus neutralization assay","rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs","microneutralization assay","non-human cells","human kidney","variety of human","antiviral agents","selected mAbs specific","strain","pathogenic avian influenza","susceptible target cells","increasing number of influenza cases","infectious virus","resulting pseudoviruses","immediate effect","important passive therapeutics","hemagglutinin","swine-origin","HPAI","need","monoclonal antibodies","vaccines","VietNam","infection","viral pathogens","various antivirals","worldwide outbreak","backbone","requirement","biosafety","laboratory","HIV","study"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to describe GE and RTI outbreaks with infection and all-cause lethality rates according to the individual characteristics of nursing home residents. METHODS: Clinical and virological surveillance were conducted (2007 to 2018). Virus stratifications for the analysis were: outbreaks with positive norovirus or influenza identifications (respectively NoV\u002B or Flu\u002B), episodes with no NoV or influenza identification or testing (respectively NoV- or Flu-). Associations between individual variables (sex, age, length of stay (LOS), autonomy status) and infection and lethality rates were tested with univariate and Mantel-Haenszel (MH) methods. RESULTS: 61 GE outbreaks and 76 RTI oubreaks (total 137 outbreaks) were recorded involving respectively 4309 and 5862 residents. In univariate analysis, higher infection rates and age were associated in NoV\u002B, NoV-, and Flu\u002B contexts, and lower infection rates were associated with longer stays (NoV\u002B and NoV-). In MH stratified analysis (virus, sex (female/male)) adjusted for LOS (\u003C4 or \u22654 years), the odds of being infected remained significant among older residents (\u226586 years): NoV\u002B/male (Odds ratio (OR(MH)): 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16\u20132.30) and Flu\u002B/female and male (respectively OR(MH): 1.50, CI: 1.27\u20131.79 and 1.73, CI: 1.28\u20132.33). In univariate analysis, lower autonomy status (NoV\u002B, Flu\u002B and Flu-) and increased age (Flu\u002B) were associated with higher lethality. In MH adjusted analysis, significant OR(age) adjusted for autonomy was: Flu\u002B/ \u226586 years compared with \u003C86 years, 1.97 (1.19\u20133.25) and OR(autonomy) adjusted for age for the more autonomous group (compared with the less autonomous group) was: Flu\u002B, 0.41 (0.24\u20130.69); Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90). CONCLUSION: The residents of nursing homes are increasingly elderly and dependent.

First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water column concentrations are below \u22CD0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and infaunal shellfish (C. virginica and M. mercenaria).

Several ACE2 variants that reduced SARS-CoV S-protein association similarly reduced that of HCoV-NL63, whereas alteration of a number of solvent-exposed ACE2 residues did not interfere with binding by either S protein.

But no comparative studies had been conducted to discern the differences in epidemiologic and clinical abnormalities between HAdV-55 and other types (HAdV-7, HAdV-3, HAdV-14, HAdV-50, and HAdV-C). Methods A multicenter surveillance study for adult and adolescent community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was conducted prospectively in Beijing and Yan Tai between November 2010 and April 2012. A standardized data form was used to record clinical information. The viral DNA extracted from the clinical samples or adenovirus viral isolates was sequenced. Results Among 969 cases, 48 (5%) were identified as adenovirus pneumonia. Six branches were clustered: HAdV-55 in 21, HAdV-7 in 11, HAdV-3 in nine, HAdV-14 in four, HAdV-50 in two, and HAdV-C in one. Most HAdV-55 cases were identified during February and March. All the hypervariable regions of the hexon genes of the 21 HAdV-55 strains were completely identical. Patients who had HAdV-55 were about 10 years older (P = .027) and had higher pneumonia severity index scores (P = .030) compared with those with other types (HAdV-7, HAdV-3, HAdV-14, HAdV-50, and HAdV-C). Systemic BP was also higher among patients in the HAdV-55 group (P = .006). Unilateral or bilateral consolidations were the most common radiologic findings in both patients with HAdV-55 and those with other types (57.9% vs 36%). More than one-half of the patients were admitted to hospital; oxygen therapy was given to 29.2% of the 48 patients, and two needed mechanical ventilation. Conclusions HAdV-55 has established itself as a major pneumonia pathogen in the Chinese population, and further surveillance and monitoring of this agent as a cause of CAP is warranted.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Bin; Huang, Guo-Hong; Pu, Zeng-Hui; Qu, Jiu-Xin; Yu, Xiao-Min; Zhu, Zhen; Dong, Jian-Ping; Gao, Yan; Zhang, Yong-Xiang; Li, Xiao-Hui; Liu, Jian-Hua; Wang, Hong; Xu, Qian; Li, Hui; Xu, Wenbo; Wang, Chen","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a19bb174be837fd7a2cbee20a107a21cf5c23465.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094559.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215493328; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215493328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551881/; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.13-1186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Yan Tai"],"organizations":["BP","CAP"],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["HAdV-C","Conclusions HAdV","Patients","adenovirus pneumonia","types","clinical samples","clinical abnormalities","clinical information","major pneumonia pathogen","adenovirus viral isolates","higher pneumonia severity index scores","severe cases of emerging human adenovirus","viral DNA","cause of CAP","multicenter surveillance study","adult","adolescent community","Chinese population","common radiologic findings","bilateral consolidations","monitoring","Methods","agent","hexon genes","hypervariable regions","Beijing","standardized data form","differences","hospital","needed mechanical ventilation","Systemic BP","group","oxygen therapy","years older","Yan Tai","Background","branches","strains","comparative studies","Results","vs","China"],"language":"en"},

They belong to at least five antigenic groups. CV cause localized infections of the respiratory and/or intestinal tracts, with the exception of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIVP) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (HEV) which cause systemic infections. The enteropathogenic CV infect the villous enterocytes resulting in villous atrophy leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. Several CV (bovine CV-BCV, porcine respiratory CV-PRCV, infectious bronchitis virus-IBV) cause respiratory disease. Current evidence indicates that protection against enteric and respiratory CV infections is mediated by passive or active immunity at the primary site of CV replication. Maternal vaccination approaches to induce passive immunity include the use of inactivated and modified live viral vaccines. Modified live viruses and a Ts mutant CV (FIPV) are also used as oral or intranasal vaccines to induce active mucosal immunity. The success of these vaccines in the field is often compromised by a number of potential problems. Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped viruses, ranging from 80\u2013160 nm in diameter and containing a positive-stranded RNA genome. They possess prominent surface spikes and some species display a fringe of smaller surface projections believed to be the hemagglutinin (HE). Coronaviruses possess 3 to 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein (150\u2013200 kDa), the integral membrane glycoprotein (M; 20\u201330 kDa) and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N; 43\u201350 kDa). A subset of CV (BCV, HEV, turkey CV) possess a third glycoprotein on the virion surface, the HE (60\u201365 kDa). These proteins can be quantitated using pooled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to distinct epitopes of each protein in ELISA. Most research has focused on the S protein as a candidate antigen for CV vaccines since it induces virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. However the HE protein stimulates the production of VN and HE inhibiting antibodies and the M protein induces antibodies that neutralize virus in the presence of complement. Attempts to correlate in vitro VN antibody activity with in vivo protection have shown that the passive transfer of VN mAb to the S or HE protein conferred passive protection against CV challenge in some studies, but not others. Additional research has implicated a possible role for other CV proteins in immunity. Studies of mAb to the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) have provided evidence for a direct role of the M protein in the induction of \u03B1IFN by porcine blood leukocytes. The potential significance of this phenomenon to immunity to TGEV is unclear. Similarly, studies of IBV have suggested that determinants recognized by T cells reside on the N protein and these determinants may be shared among heterologous strains of IBV, resulting in the induction of cross-protection. Thus epitopes on the N protein may be important for induction of cell mediated immunity (CMI). CMI may play an important role in protection of cats against FIPV, since induction of circulating antibodies to the S protein of FIPV contributes to disease pathogenesis by the induction of immune complexes and antibody dependent enhancement of the infectivity of FIPV for macrophages. An increased understanding of antibody and CMI responses following natural CV infections in animals is needed to identify the antigens and epitopes that induce protective immune responses. The expression of CV structural protein genes in various vectors will provide the recombinant proteins needed for future immunogenicity studies in the host species. Furthermore, live rDNA vectors that replicate in the gut and express coronavirus genes may provide a new generation of coronavirus vaccines.","publish_time":"1993-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30d03a6bfb99b7abf5e8e7c41b7ba38531298a4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359390030B; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359390030B","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VN","TGEV","CMI","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CV vaccines","CV proteins","turkey CV","CV challenge","enteropathogenic CV","subset of CV","respiratory CV infections","natural CV infections","N protein","expression of CV structural protein genes","bovine CV-BCV","S protein of FIPV","Ts mutant CV","CV cause localized infections","porcine respiratory CV-PRCV","passive immunity","primary site of CV replication","passive protection","protein of transmissible gastroenteritis","active immunity","kDa","induction of circulating antibodies","induction of cell mediated immunity","Studies of mAb","studies of IBV","induction of \u03B1IFN","cause respiratory disease","active mucosal immunity","induction of cross","protection of cats","structural proteins","passive transfer of VN mAb","intranasal vaccines","viral vaccines","induction of immune complexes","VN antibody activity","infectious bronchitis virus-IBV","infectivity of FIPV","CMI responses","important role","recombinant proteins","systemic infections","production of VN","live viruses","pooled monoclonal antibodies","new generation of coronavirus vaccines","HEV","possible role","distinct epitopes","future immunogenicity studies","direct role","determinants","TGEV","live rDNA vectors","virion surface","Abstract Coronaviruses","exception of feline infectious peritonitis virus","antibody dependent enhancement","protective immune responses","express coronavirus genes","increased understanding of antibody","heterologous strains of IBV","prominent surface spikes","integral membrane glycoprotein","various vectors","disease pathogenesis","villous atrophy","villous enterocytes","host species","companion animals","fringe of smaller surface projections","Current evidence","enveloped viruses","potential significance","Additional research","porcine blood leukocytes","number of potential problems","FIVP","hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis","gut","phenomenon","variety of livestock","candidate antigen","use of inactivated","poultry","antigens","Maternal vaccination approaches","T cells","positive-stranded RNA genome","intestinal tracts","diameter","malabsorptive diarrhea","field","nucleocapsid phosphoprotein","ELISA","presence of complement","nm","hemagglutinin","macrophages","success","antigenic groups"],"language":"en"},

However, evidence of the infection is scanty in Ghana. This study was conducted to detect canine parvovirus antigen in dogs presented with diarrhoea to the Government Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Faecal samples from 72 dogs presented with diarrhoea were tested for the presence of canine parvovirus antigen using commercially available rapid test kit (BIT(\u00AE) Rapid Colour Canine Parvovirus Ag Test Kit, BIOINDIST Co. Ltd, Korea) based on the principle of immunochromatography. Influence of breed, sex, age, vaccination history and the nature of diarrhoea were assessed. Data obtained was analysed with SPSS and subjected to the chi-square test. Significance was at \u03B1(0.05) RESULTS: We found 61.11% tested positive (44/72) for CPV. Based on sex, 61.54% of males (20/33) and 60.61% of females tested positive (24/39). A total of 65.67% of samples from puppies below 6 months were positive. 56.25% of CPV vaccinated dogs and 70.83% of unvaccinated dogs were positive respectively. 69.05% of samples from haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs and 50.00% from non-haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs were positive of CPV. CONCLUSION: The study is the first documented evidence of the existence of CPV in Ghana. It also revealed that absence of bloody diarrhoea does not necessarily rule out CPV infection.","publish_time":"2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Folitse, R.

Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged \u003C3 years, 3.6 years, and \u22656-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Fang; Liao, Chun; Fan, Qi-hong; Chen, Hong-bo; Zhao, Xue-gong; Xie, Zhong-guo; Li, Xi-lin; Chen, Chun-xi; Lu, Xiao-xia; Liu, Zhi-sheng; Lu, Wei; Chen, Chun-bao; Jiao, Rong; Zhang, Ai-ming; Wang, Jin-tang; Ding, Xi-wei; Zeng, Yao-guang; Cheng, Li-ping; Huang, Qing-feng; Wu, Jiang; Luo, Xi-chang; Wang, Zhu-jun; Zhong, Yan-yan; Bai, Yan; Wu, Xiao-yan; Jin, Run-ming","journal":"Curr Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bae994b36a9c15b8060f0d6edeb867aeb60151e5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207032/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-020-2172-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hubei"],"keyphrases":["critical cases","majority cases","pediatric cases of COVID","clinical characteristics of pediatric cases","increasing number of cases","children","years patients","years old","clinical manifestations","Clinical diagnoses","clinical presentations","outcomes","hospitalized patients","radiological data","demographic data","age group","median age","common symptoms","bilateral involvement","unilateral involvement of lungs","underlying diseases","laboratory","extra attentions","epidemiological history","subsequent weeks","upper respiratory tract infection","home caring","hospitalization treatment","Chest CT images","corticosteroids","onset of illness","treatments","adults","invasive mechanical ventilation","hospitals","immunoglobulin","fever","boy","mild pneumonia","cross-sectional multicenter study","Hubei province","girl ratio","total","health problem","dry cough"],"language":"en"},

Due to the emergence of new viruses and frequent virus variation, conventional antiviral strategies that directly target viral or cellular proteins are limited because of the specificity, drug resistance and rapid clearance from the human body. Therefore, developing safe and potent antiviral agents with activity against viral infection at multiple points in the viral life cycle remains a major challenge. In this report, we propose a new modality to inhibit viral infection by fabricating DNA conjugated gold nanoparticle (DNA-AuNP) networks on cell membranes as a protective barrier. The DNA-AuNPs networks were found, via a plaque formation assay and viral titers, to have potent antiviral ability and protect host cells from human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Confocal immunofluorescence image analysis showed 80 \u00B1 3.8% of viral attachment, 91.1 \u00B1 0.9% of viral entry and 87.9 \u00B1 2.8% of viral budding were inhibited by the DNA-AuNP networks, which were further confirmed by real-time fluorescence imaging of the RSV infection process. The antiviral activity of the networks may be attributed to steric effects, the disruption of membrane glycoproteins and limited fusion of cell membrane bilayers, all of which play important roles in viral infection. Therefore, our results suggest that the DNA-AuNP networks have not only prophylactic effects to inhibit virus attachment and entry, but also therapeutic effects to inhibit viral budding and cell-to-cell spread. More importantly, this proof-of-principle study provides a pathway for the development of a universal, broad-spectrum antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chun Mei; Zheng, Lin Ling; Yang, Xiao Xi; Wan, Xiao Yan; Wu, Wen Bi; Zhen, Shu Jun; Li, Yuan Fang; Luo, Ling Fei; Huang, Cheng Zhi","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/167caeff381e12ac6cf14497ee14c54253ee13db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112435.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961215009047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26606447/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961215009047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral budding","viral attachment","viral entry","viral titers","viral life cycle","Abstract Viral infections","DNA-AuNP networks","DNA-AuNPs networks","antiviral activity","potent antiviral ability","potent antiviral agents","virus attachment","cell membranes","conventional antiviral strategies","RSV infection process","broad-spectrum antiviral therapy","therapeutic effects","prophylactic effects","steric effects","limited fusion of cell membrane bilayers","fabricating DNA conjugated gold nanoparticle","human respiratory syncytial virus","frequent virus variation","human body","new modality","disruption of membrane glycoproteins","emergence of new viruses","host cells","multiple points","specificity","rapid clearance","development","numerous diseases","real-time fluorescence imaging","drug resistance","plaque formation assay","pathway","major challenge","principle study","cellular proteins","protective barrier","important roles","Confocal immunofluorescence image analysis","deaths","proof","report","results"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, Phe-tRNA translates a UUU codon within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HIV and Asn-tRNA translates a AAC codon within the proposed frameshift signals in HTLV-1 and BLV. Thus, the lack of a highly modified base in the anticodon loop of tRNAs in retroviral infected cells is correlated with the participation of these undermodified tRNAs in the corresponding frameshift event.

Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory were reviewed. Multiple databases (China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase) were systematically searched from inception to June 12, 2018. Two authors independently extracted the data and performed a methodological quality assessment of the RCTs. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the data analysis. The effect sizes for the primary outcome measures were expressed as relative risks or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Results A total of 13 RCTs were selected, involving 12 types of diseases and 4695 patients. The methodological quality of the RCTs was generally low. Five studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with conventional TCM therapies, and the remaining eight studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with biomedical treatments. All of the RCTs reported that the effectiveness of the treatment intervention was better than that of the intervention in the control group. Conclusion Because of many methodological problems in existing clinical studies, it remains impossible to definitively conclude that FCSQ theory can improve clinical effectiveness. It is difficult to unify the clinical application of FCSQ theory. The feasibility and repeatability of FCSQ as an intervention should be given more attention in future clinical research. Future work should also follow international norms for clinical research implementation and reporting to provide high-quality evidence for evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Qiaoling; Hao, Yu; Song, Jia; Sun, Lingzhi; He, Juan","journal":"Journal of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac217c7b1b49cbf59928200e285ba2a9186b32b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095754818301480; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095754818301480","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","FCSQ","China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical effectiveness","clinical value of FCSQ theory","clinical application of FCSQ theory","RCTs","repeatability of FCSQ","effectiveness of TCM treatments","existing clinical studies","future clinical research","clinical research implementation","Wanfang Data","conventional TCM therapies","biomedical treatments","data analysis","methodological problems","methodological quality assessment","treatment intervention","Future work","traditional Chinese medicine","Chinese Scientific Journals Database","China Network Knowledge Infrastructure","SinoMed","Cochrane Library","international norms","primary outcome measures","relative risks","mean differences","Multiple databases","high-quality evidence","Embase","effect sizes","PubMed","qi","attention","circuits","terms","controlled trials","confidence intervals","software","Conclusion","Methods","Abstract Objective","types of diseases","patients","control group","feasibility","RevMan","inception","authors","total"],"language":"en"},

The activity of host cell proteases, which cleave and activate the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, is essential for viral infectivity and constitutes a target for intervention. However, the identities of the proteases involved have been unclear. Pioneer studies identified cathepsins and type II transmembrane serine proteases as cellular activators of SARS-CoV and demonstrated that several emerging viruses might exploit these enzymes to promote their spread.

The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing, etc. The significance of CpG island methylation status in normal development, cell differentiation and gene expression is widely recognized, although still stays poorly understood. METHODS: We performed whole genome DNA methylation array analysis on DNA pool samples from peripheral blood from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy individuals. This technique allowed us to determine the methylation status of 27 627 CpG islands throughout the whole genome in healthy controls and BEN patients. Thus we obtained the methylation profile of BEN patients from Bulgarian and Serbian endemic regions. RESULTS: Using specifically developed software we compared the methylation profiles of BEN patients and corresponding controls and revealed the differently methylated regions. We then compared the DMRs between all patient-control pairs to determine common changes in the epigenetic profiles. SEC61G, IL17RA, HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs. The CpG islands of all 3 genes were hypomethylated compared to controls. This suggests that dysregulation of these genes involved in immunological response could be a common mechanism in BEN pathogenesis in both endemic regions and in both genders. CONCLUSION: Our data propose a new hypothesis that immunologic dysregulation has a place in BEN etiopathogenesis.","publish_time":"2013-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Staneva, Rada; Rukova, Blaga; Hadjidekova, Savina; Nesheva, Desislava; Antonova, Olga; Dimitrov, Plamen; Simeonov, Valeri; Stamenov, Georgi; Cukuranovic, Rade; Cukuranovic, Jovana; Stefanovic, Vladislav; Polenakovic, Momir; Dimova, Ivanka; Hlushchuk, Ruslan; Djonov, Valentin; Galabov, Angel; Toncheva, Draga","journal":"BMC Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a2360e93ec038502133c97cf78a114c012e5df4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3852817.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131581/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2369-14-225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG"],"locations":["Danube"],"keyphrases":["methylation profiles of BEN patients","methylation profile of BEN patients","BEN pathogenesis","BEN etiopathogenesis","Serbian endemic regions","methylated regions","genome DNA methylation array analysis","significance of CpG island methylation status","endemic distribution","CpG islands","healthy controls","Balkan endemic nephropathy","Danube river regions","epigenetic profiles","corresponding controls","healthy individuals","patient-control pairs","DNA pool samples","common mechanism","gene silencing","common changes","gene expression","immunologic dysregulation","affected individuals","Balkan countries","primary epigenetic modification","normal development","uroepithelial tumours","striking correlation","chronic progressive interstitial nephritis","peripheral blood","cell differentiation","cancer","genomic imprinting","major processes","new hypothesis","place","immunological response","upper urinary tract","data","BACKGROUND","disease","DMRs","software","SEC61G","IL17RA","HDAC11","CONCLUSION","METHODS","genders","RESULTS","technique"],"language":"en"},

However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P\u003C0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P\u003C0.0001 and P\u003C0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.","publish_time":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hicks, Allison L.; Duffy, Siobain","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86bd9005ed7a8aa7f895a9d0769b8dd8e4990e06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3887100.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutation rates","substitution rates of structural genes","rates of non-structural genes","long-term nucleotide substitution rates","significant predictors of viral substitution rates","epithelial-infecting viruses","comparable published rates","highest turnover rates","high rates of RNA virus evolution","neurotropic viruses","target cells","proliferative epithelial cells","fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses","substitution rate variation","nucleotide substitution rate estimates","error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","different cell tropisms","genome length","genome sense","genome segmentation","viral evolvability","different species","results","intrinsic genomic properties","viral generation times","virus ecology","ecological factors","transmission route","infection duration","host range","differences","dataset","strong evidence","key factor","replication","relationships","orders of magnitude","neurons","tailed t-tests","selection pressures","ANCOVA analyses"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods The thirty-four cases, 15 females and 19 males, with an age ranging from 7 to 88 years old, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were used for our study. All thin-section CT scans of the lungs were performed in all of patients. The clinical, laboratory and CT imaging were available to evaluate in all patients. Results The patients present with fever (85.29%, n = 29), cough (67.65%, n = 23), fatigue or myalgia (26.47%, n = 9), and pharyngalgia (8.82%, n = 3). The 4 patients (11.76%) with no symptoms were identified during screening for close contacts, who had typical CT findings. On initial CT scans, the bilateral lung involved was shown in 24 cases (70.59%), while 29 (82.35%) cases were distributed in peripheral. The pure ground glass opacity (GGO) was shown in 18 cases (52.94%), the GGO with consolidation was in 12 cases (35.29%), and full consolidation only in 3 cases. The lesion with air bronchogram was seen in 14 (41.18%) cases, with enlarged blood vessel in 17 (50.00%) cases, with crazy-paving pattern in 8 (23.53%) cases, with fine reticular pattern in 4 (11.77%) cases, and with intralesional vacuole sign in 6 (17.65%) cases. The pleural effusion was seen in one patient. Follow-up imaging in 19 patients during the study time window demonstrated mild, moderate or severe progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities. Conclusions The bilateral GGO with air bronchogram, enlarged blood vessel, fine reticular pattern, and peripheral distribution are the early CT findings of COVID-19. The crazy-paving pattern and intralesional vacuole sign are the features of progressive stage.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Litao; Kong, Xue; Li, Xiujuan; Zhu, Jianzhong; Liu, Shanping; Li, Weiwei; Xu, Chunlin; Du, Huanwang; Jing, Hui; Xu, Jiahuan; Shi, Tongtong; Xie, Yuanzhong","journal":"Clinical imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ca88a88c808dcbb12a6463af2a6c399df06864e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425337/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707120301704?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707120301704","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","patients","CT imaging","typical CT findings","initial CT scans","early CT findings of COVID","section CT scans","fine reticular pattern","crazy-paving pattern","bilateral GGO","enlarged blood vessel","intralesional vacuole sign","air bronchogram","bilateral lung","consolidation","peripheral distribution","Coronavirus disease","Follow-up imaging","severe progression of disease","study time window","density of lung opacities","polymerase chain reaction","real-time reverse-transcriptase","extent","close contacts","RT-PCR","pure ground glass opacity","features of progressive stage","laboratory","Conclusions","lungs","years old","screening","methods","females","Abstract Objective","pleural effusion","symptoms","fatigue","myalgia","Materials","cough","pharyngalgia","fever"],"language":"en"},

Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident. Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools. METHODS A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: \u0022COVID-19\u0022, \u0022nCov 19\u0022, and \u0022Sars Cov 2\u0022. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: \u0022death\u0022, \u0022died\u0022, \u0022comorbidity\u0022, \u0022cause of death\u0022, \u0022biopsy\u0022, \u0022autopsy\u0022, or \u0022pathological\u0022. RESULTS A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data. DISCUSSION The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies. The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer. The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock. Only 7 papers reported histological investigations. Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them. The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection. Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients. As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary. Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salerno, Monica; Sessa, Francesco; Piscopo, Amalia; Montana, Angelo; Torrisi, Marco; Patan\u00E8, Federico; Murabito, Paolo; Volti, Giovanni Li; Pomara, Cristoforo","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422983/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["following COVID","exact cause of death","infection","selected studies","analyzed studies","examined studies","current outbreak of COVID","Laboratory confirmation of COVID","duplicated articles","patients","well-defined pathophysiology of death","autopsy-based data","common reported complications","autopsy practice","increasing number of published studies","respiratory disorders","common comorbidities","complete analysis","acute kidney injury","lack of postmortem investigation","acute respiratory distress syndrome","cardiac injury","metabolic disorders","significant threat","main data","following words","tool of investigation","additional criteria","global threat","effective therapies","effective treatment","inclusion criteria","therapeutic tools","complete autopsies","mortality rate","coronary artery disease","available tools necessary","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","public health requiring surveillance","prompt diagnosis","ARDS","liver insufficiency","cardiovascular diseases","hypertension","coagulation system","PubMed database","prothrombotic activity","epidemiologic information","research efforts","unknown pathogen","pathophysiological insights","diabetes","obesity","definition","consequent thromboembolism","method of study","literature review","field of medicine","Wuhan","science","key terms","septic shock","ongoing challenge","reinforcement","Hubei province","China","clear alteration","cancer","physicians","DISCUSSION","histopathological findings","BACKGROUND","abstracts","English","biopsy","pathways","papers","histological investigations","improvement","METHODS","total","nCov","cases","comorbidity","Sars Cov","scientific community"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was performed in the Netherlands during 2 winters. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected during influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes and from controls. Viruses and bacteria were identified by multiplex ligation\u2013dependent probe amplification assay and conventional bacterial culture. RESULTS: The ILI incidence in the consecutive seasons was 7.2% and 11.6%, and influenza virus caused 18.9% and 34.2% of ILI episodes. Potential pathogen were detected in 80% of the ILI events with influenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and Haemophilus influenzae being the most common. Influenza vaccination reduced influenza virus infection by 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26%\u201390%) and 51% (95% CI, 7%\u201374%) in ILI patients.

The bats were immobilized with anesthetic and analgesic treatment according to the ethics committee of the University of C\u00F3rdoba, morphometric measurements and blood samples were taken, later they were necropsied in the field to obtain a collection of tissues which were preserved in liquid N2 \u2212190 \u00B0C. The averages of the climatic conditions of the sampling sites were extracted from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org/). The open source software QGIS (Quantum GIS Development Team.2015) was used to map and visualize bioclimatic regions of C\u00F3rdoba. We used descriptive and retrospective information about the equine population and reports of foci of equine encephalitis. Results In C\u00F3rdoba and Sucre, 286 bats were captured and 23 species were classified, Artibeus and Phyllostomus discolor were the most frequent captured genus. The geographic ranges of the captured species were variable, some had a wide distribution and others were restricted to some areas. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus RNA was detected in Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium (2/286 = 0.70%) from Cordoba \u2013 Colombia. The univariate descriptive analysis showed no significant association for any of the analyzed variables climatic. Conclusions Frugivorous bats from the Caribbean area of Colombia may be involved in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus enzootic cycle.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guzm\u00E1n, Camilo; Calder\u00F3n, Alfonso; Martinez, Catty; Oviedo, Misael; Mattar, Salim","journal":"Acta Tropica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/718b8f0082565f4bf70f2d0fd4627bc52b904257.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172953.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X18307460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X18307460; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.12.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Phyllostomus","Sturnira"],"organizations":["Quantum GIS Development Team"],"locations":["Latin America","Colombia","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["University of C\u00F3rdoba","localities of C\u00F3rdoba","bats of departments","Sucre","captured species","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus RNA","equine population","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus enzootic cycle","Conclusions Frugivorous bats","bioclimatic regions of C\u00F3rdoba","frequent captured genus","prospective descriptive cross-sectional study","univariate descriptive analysis","Caribbean area of Colombia","sampling sites","Artibeus planirostris","climatic conditions","non-probabilistic sampling","analyzed variables climatic","high impact","open source software QGIS","Quantum GIS Development Team","emerging infectious disease","public health","significant association","reports of foci","morphometric measurements","ethics committee","eco-epidemiology of alphaviruses","Latin America","analgesic treatment","retrospective information","Abstract Alphavirus infection","blood samples","Methodology","Phyllostomus","geographic ranges","collection of tissues","mist nets capture","specimens","averages","Sturnira lilium","liquid N2","WorldClim database","field","wide distribution","Objective","size","Results","Cordoba","areas"],"language":"en"},

The vectors basically consist of some typical numerical features for certain biological problems. The features may come from the primary sequences, secondary or three dimensional structures of macromolecules. In this study, we propose a novel numerical vector based on only primary sequences of organism to build their phylogeny. Three chemical and physical properties of primary sequences: purine, pyrimidine and keto are also incorporated to the vector. Using each property, we convert the nucleotide sequence into a new sequence consisting of only two kinds of letters. Therefore, three sequences are constructed according to the three properties. For each letter of each sequence we calculate the number of the letter, the average position of the letter and the variation of the position of the letter appearing in the sequence. Tested on several datasets related to mammals, viruses and bacteria, this new tool is fast in speed and accurate for inferring the phylogeny of organisms.","publish_time":"2017-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yongkun; He, Lily; Lucy He, Rong; Yau, Stephen S.-T.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67773f5f18353fa2783c550d6c7fc52a2e10d0bc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e981fac56a2168159157612f40eb0f5fa17a6660.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5610321.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28939913/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-12493-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new sequence","biological sequences","sequence analysis","nucleotide sequence","primary sequences of organism","traditional sequence alignment methods","physical properties of primary sequences","novel numerical vector","sorts of feature vector methods","phylogeny of organisms","typical numerical features","reconstruction of species phylogeny","new tool","average position","surge of fast alignment-free techniques","certain biological problems","purine","viruses","bacteria","dimensional structures of macromolecules","speed","keto","pyrimidine","variation","sharp increasing","mammals","number","datasets","study","vectors","kinds of letters","property"],"language":"en"},

Methods Forty-four patients with SS were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive 5 mg pilocarpine (Salagen) or placebo tablet four times daily for 12 weeks. Global evaluation and subjective responses of patients were assessed by questionnaires with visual analog scales and categorical checkboxes.

Improving racial disparities in COVID-19 will require that we implement policies that address structural racism at the root of these disparities.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poteat, Tonia; Millett, Greg; Nelson, LaRon E.; Beyrer, Chris","journal":"Annals of epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24b5aafaf8c41ab4199824dced6075bcbd93d141.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419765/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279720301770?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047279720301770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["syndemic conditions","underlying conditions","conditions of health","lethal force of COVID","Black Americans","present-day factors","Syndemic theory","structural racism","racial disparities","Abstract Black communities","political gerrymandering","employment discrimination","lack of Medicaid expansion","mortgage redlining","chattel slavery","United States","useful framework","healthcare provider bias","brunt","interacting epidemics","manifestations","pandemic","social disparity","negative consequences","root","policies"],"language":"en"},

Myeloid cells, including monocytes and macrophages, play an important role in this balance, particularly through the activities of the arginine-hydrolyzing enzymes nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2; iNOS) and arginase 1 (Arg1). Nitric oxide (NO) production by iNOS is an important proinflammatory mediator, whereas Arg1-expressing macrophages contribute to the resolution of inflammation and wound repair. In the context of viral infections, expression of these enzymes can result in a variety of outcomes for the host. NO has direct antiviral properties against some viruses, whereas during other virus infections NO can mediate immunopathology and/or inhibit the antiviral immune response to promote chronic infection. Arg1 activity not only has important wound healing functions but can also inhibit the antiviral immune response during some viral infections. Thus, depending on the specific virus and the tissue(s) involved, the activity of both of these arginine-hydrolyzing enzymes can either exacerbate or limit the severity of virus-induced disease. In this review, we will discuss a variety of viral infections, including HIV, SARS-CoV, LCMV, HCV, RSV, and others, where myeloid cells influence the control and clearance of the virus from the host, as well as the severity and resolution of tissue damage, via the activities of iNOS and/or Arg1. Clearly, monocyte/macrophage activation and arginine metabolism will continue to be important areas of investigation in the context of viral infections.","publish_time":"2014-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burrack, Kristina S.; Morrison, Thomas E.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94ba61be5805b1b0caef6716c00ed234be78b021.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4157561.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infections","robust antiviral immune response","excessive immune response","context of viral infections","variety of viral infections","antiviral properties","severity of virus","Arg1 activity","immune-mediated pathology","important role","activities of iNOS","specific virus","important proinflammatory mediator","repair tissue damage","resolution of tissue damage","arginine-hydrolyzing enzymes nitric oxide synthase","arginine metabolism","production of proinflammatory","important areas of investigation","macrophages","important wound healing functions","wound repair","Myeloid cells","balance","host","control","chronic infection","resolution of inflammation","variety of outcomes","HIV","Nos2","SARS-CoV","cytotoxic effectors","LCMV","clearance","HCV","RSV","macrophage activation","monocytes","viruses","expression","opposing pathways","induced disease","arginase","immunopathology","regulators","review"],"language":"en"},

The largest of the SARS-CoV accessory protein open reading frames (SARS 3a) oligomerizes, dynamically inserting into late endosomal, lysosomal, and trans-Golgi-network membranes. While previously implicated in a non-inflammatory apoptotic cell death pathway, here we extend the range of SARS 3a pathophysiologic targets by examining its effects on necrotic cell death pathways. We show that SARS 3a interacts with Receptor Interacting Protein 3 (Rip3), which augments the oligomerization of SARS 3a helping drive necrotic cell death. In addition, by inserting into lysosomal membranes SARS 3a triggers lysosomal damage and dysfunction. Consequently, Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) translocates to the nucleus increasing the transcription of autophagy- and lysosome-related genes. Finally, SARS 3a activates caspase-1 either directly or via an enhanced potassium efflux, which triggers NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. In summary, Rip3-mediated oligomerization of SARS 3a causes necrotic cell death, lysosomal damage, and caspase-1 activation\u2014all likely contributing to the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yue, Yuan; Nabar, Neel R.; Shi, Chong-Shan; Kamenyeva, Olena; Xiao, Xun; Hwang, Il-Young; Wang, Min; Kehrl, John H.","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/263a93d919f1c783a014ddb3f1b15d7ad3a3553b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6125346.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-018-0917-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30185776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Receptor Interacting Protein","Transcription Factor EB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["range of SARS","lysosomal membranes SARS","SARS-CoV infections","clinical manifestations of SARS","Rip3-mediated oligomerization of SARS","causes necrotic cell death","necrotic cell death pathways","SARS-CoV accessory protein open reading frames","triggers lysosomal damage","non-inflammatory apoptotic cell death pathway","caspase","transcription of autophagy","Transcription Factor EB","trans-Golgi-network membranes","effects","severe lung pathology","helping","pathophysiologic targets","enhanced potassium efflux","NLRP3 inflammasome assembly","molecular mechanisms","TFEB","oligomerizes","lysosome-related genes","nucleus","summary","activation","dysfunction","Receptor","addition"],"language":"en"},

The fact that the Ebola virus subtypes, which have caused human disease episodes, have been different from one another makes it clear that a common source human-to-human transmission chain extending across sub-Saharan Africa is not the case and rather, virus subtypes lodged at or near each site of the recent human disease episodes have been responsible. Filovirus virions are enveloped and pleomorphic, appearing filamentous or bacilliform, U-shaped, 6-shaped, or circular. Particles have a uniform diameter of 80 nm, but vary greatly in length. The degree of the stability of filovirus sequences overall and the absence of genetic variability among Ebola virus isolates obtained within an outbreak match the character of other member viruses of the order, Mononegavirales. In rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, African green monkeys, and baboons inoculated with Marburg virus or the Zaire subtype of Ebola virus, the incubation period is 4\u20136 days, during which time virus replicates to high titer in the reticuloendothelial system, endothelium, liver, and lungs.

One potential problem standing in the way of wider adoption of One Health principles, though, is that use of conventional cell fermentation systems for production of the recombinant proteins that could be used as diagnostics or vaccines is often expensive and is not easily scalable.

Therapies that expedite IFN I induction as well as interventions that antagonize immunoevasive virus proteins are thus promising candidates for immune modulation.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijay, Rahul; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bd127aee44910d7a7377a1a58a48d9b91ebc209.json; document_parses/pdf_json/86a998617c077f4fe2ab26214995a3548fbc0fc5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/14dc80ab74fae7588767f9c9c593b2b29496d2f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4821769.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625716000146; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2016.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26855039/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625716000146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["immune modulation","lethal respiratory infection","block host immune responses","CoV","poor adaptive immune response","IFN","viruses","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Severe Acute respiratory syndrome","induction of Type","coronavirus pathogenesis","promising candidates","close relative","MERS","immunoevasive virus proteins","interventions","SARS","recent emergence","diverse strategies","marked delay","need","humans","interferon","transmission","Therapies"],"language":"en"},

This study used two sets of experimental data for transient particle transport to validate the model. In general, the trends in the particle concentration distributions predicted by the Markov chain model agreed reasonably well with the experimental data. This investigation also applied the model to the calculation of person-to-person particle transport in a ventilated room.

The vast majority of scientific articles dealing with nosocomial infections address bacterial or fungal infections, and viral agents are often disregarded. This analysis reviews the medical literature in an effort to establish the incidence, types of pathogens, and clinical features of noncongenital neonatal viral infections. Methods This analysis was performed using the worldwide database of health care\u2013associated outbreaks (http://www.outbreak-database.com). Items analyzed included causative pathogens, types of infection, source of outbreaks, and measures taken to stop outbreaks. Results The outbreak database contained a total of 590 neonatal outbreaks, of which 64 were originated by viruses, 44 of which (68.75%) were reported from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The 5 most frequent viral agents were rotavirus (23.44%), respiratory syncytial virus (17.19%), enterovirus (15.63%), hepatitis A virus (10.94%), and adenovirus (9.38%). Conclusion Our analysis of the viral origins of nosocomial infections in NICUs can be a valuable tool in the investigation of neonatal infections. The mortality rates reported in this analysis demonstrate the significance of noncongenital viral infections in NICUs and the need for more effective outbreak prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Civardi, Elisa; Tzialla, Chryssoula; Baldanti, Fausto; Strocchio, Luisa; Manzoni, Paolo; Stronati, Mauro","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daff6ac7ece180dfb53e12fbaf8a1902f1a31d83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132694.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655313001892; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655313001892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623159/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2013.01.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis","neonatal outbreaks","viral origins of nosocomial infections","investigation of neonatal infections","fungal infections","significance of noncongenital viral infections","clinical features of noncongenital neonatal viral infections","NICUs","frequent viral agents","associated outbreaks","source of outbreaks","types of pathogens","types of infection","Background Nosocomial infection","neonatal intensive care units","outbreak database","prolonged hospital","causative pathogens","worldwide database of health care","mortality rates","increased hospital costs","respiratory syncytial virus","effective outbreak prevention strategies","need","important causes of morbidity","valuable tool","vast majority of scientific articles","effort","neonates","rotavirus","total","medical literature","incidence","Items","measures","Conclusion","enterovirus","hepatitis","Methods","viruses","adenovirus"],"language":"en"},

It involves the lysosomal degradation of cellular components such as misfolded proteins or damaged organelles. Defects in autophagy are implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including cancers, myopathy, neurodegenerations, infections and cardiovascular diseases. In the recent decade, traditional drugs with new clinical applications are not only commonly found in Western medicines, but also highlighted in Chinese herbal medicines (CHM). For instance, pharmacological studies have revealed that active components or fractions from Chaihu (Radix bupleuri), Hu Zhang (Rhizoma polygoni cuspidati), Donglingcao (Rabdosia rubesens), Hou po (Cortex magnoliae officinalis) and Chuan xiong (Rhizoma chuanxiong) modulate cancers, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease via autophagy. These findings shed light on the potential new applications and formulation of CHM decoctions via regulation of autophagy. This article reviews the roles of autophagy in the pharmacological actions of CHM and discusses their new potential clinical applications in various human diseases.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, Betty Yuen Kwan; Mok, Simon Wing Fai; Wu, An Guo; Lam, Christopher Wai Kei; Yu, Margaret Xin Yi; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/582d6fa298f66400e7059dae69cb5d3449144b0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6274228.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules21030359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hu Zhang","Hou","Chuan xiong"],"organizations":["Donglingcao"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of autophagy","regulation of autophagy","potential new applications","new clinical applications","new potential clinical applications","cardiovascular diseases","cancers","pharmacological actions of CHM","pathogenesis of diseases","lysosomal degradation of cellular components","maintenance of cellular homeostasis","formulation of CHM decoctions","various human diseases","universal catabolic cellular process","Rhizoma chuanxiong","active components","pharmacological studies","Western medicines","Rhizoma polygoni cuspidati","Chinese herbal medicines","quality control of cytoplasm","Hu Zhang","Chuan xiong","Cortex magnoliae officinalis","Chaihu","Radix bupleuri","nutrient deprivation","myopathy","traditional drugs","neurodegenerations","Hou po","misfolded proteins","Rabdosia","Donglingcao","fractions","infections","environmental stimulus","recent decade","light"],"language":"en"},

Given the limitations of conventional diagnostic techniques (i.e., microscopy and culture), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay was developed to detect Nocardia spp. on clinical samples. While this test is increasingly being used by transplant physicians, its performance characteristics are not well documented. We evaluated the performance characteristics of this test on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from lung transplant recipients (LTRs). METHODS: We prospectively included all BAL samples from LTRs undergoing bronchoscopy at our institution between December 2016 and June 2017 (either surveillance or clinically-indicated bronchoscopies). Presence of microbial pathogens was assessed using techniques available locally (including microscopy and 10-day culture for Nocardia). BAL samples were also sent to the French Nocardiosis Observatory (Lyon, France) for the Nocardia PCR-based assay. Transplant physicians and patients were blinded to the Nocardia PCR results. RESULTS: We included 29 BAL samples from 21 patients (18 surveillance and 11 clinically-indicated bronchoscopies). Nocardiosis was not diagnosed in any of these patients by conventional techniques. However, Nocardia PCR was positive in five BAL samples from five of the patients (24%, 95% confidence interval: 11\u201345%); four were asymptomatic and undergoing surveillance bronchoscopy, and one was symptomatic and was later diagnosed with influenza virus infection. None of the five PCR-positive patients died or were diagnosed with nocardiosis during the median follow-up of 21 months after the index bronchoscopy (range: 20\u201323 months). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, Nocardia PCR was positive on BAL fluid from one fourth of the LTRs. Nocardia PCR-based assays should be used with caution on respiratory samples from LTRs because of the possible detection of airway colonization using this technique. Larger studies are required to determine the usefulness of the Nocardia PCR-based assay in transplant recipients.","publish_time":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coussement, Julien; Lebeaux, David; El Bizri, Najla; Claes, Vincent; Kohnen, Michel; Steensels, Deborah; \u00C9tienne, Isabelle; Salord, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Bergeron, Emmanuelle; Rodriguez-Nava, Veronica","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8e8d36bf5ce0686ed639aceace213100fdba042.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6388935.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nocardia","BAL","Nocardia PCR"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["BAL samples","Nocardia PCR results","Nocardia PCR-based assays","PCR-positive patients","Nocardia species","fluid samples","BAL fluid","respiratory samples","LTRs","clinical samples","transplant physicians","lung transplant recipients","surveillance bronchoscopy","conventional techniques","microscopy","risk of pulmonary nocardiosis","techniques available","performance characteristics","French Nocardiosis Observatory","index bronchoscopy","months","test","bronchoscopies","limitations of conventional diagnostic techniques","day culture","life-threatening opportunistic infection","influenza virus infection","bronchoalveolar lavage","France","possible detection of airway colonization","polymerase chain reaction","Lyon","caution","prospective study","range","usefulness","median follow-up","Presence of microbial pathogens","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","institution","Larger studies","confidence interval","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Despite the public health importance, little is known about the etiology of these acute respiratory illnesses in many regions of South America. In 2006, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) initiated a collaboration to characterize the viral agents associated with ILI and to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of the affected population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with ILI (fever \u226538\u00B0C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient. During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations. At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region. Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%). Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with ILI in Peru. These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory pathogens are circulating in Peru and this fact needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients reporting with ILI. Furthermore, these data have implications for influenza vaccine design and implementation in South America.","publish_time":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laguna-Torres, V.

However, in the case of the 2009 World Games, the first international hallmark sporting event in Taiwan, the volume of hotel occupancies and revenue fell short of expectations, despite 4 years of planning and an investment of US$218 million. This study set out to investigate this phenomenon by adopting semi-structured interviews to gather opinions from key stakeholders regarding their business operation and societal conditions. Factors contributing to the lower than expected revenue included inefficient collaboration among stakeholders, a substantial displacement effect to regional hotel competitors, and the unfriendly local atmosphere associated with the fear of H1N1, Typhoon Morakot, and controversial political events. To mitigate inefficiencies from stakeholder collaborations, the study results suggest greater equality in terms of responsibility, information distribution, and risk sharing is needed among the broader tourism industry, the event planning association, and the event supervising authority. In addition, business strategies should take into account Taiwan, an island destination, and current tourism characteristics to counter the displacement effects of loyal and potential customers.","publish_time":"2013-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Ya-Yen; Rodriguez, Ariel; Wu, Jih-Hwa; Chuang, Shu-Tzu","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1dfe5a6483aa447927f71c399f6c6a41a5fce67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126599.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517712001707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287741/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517712001707; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2012.09.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["event planning association","hallmark-events","tourism development","international hallmark sporting event","current tourism characteristics","broader tourism industry","event supervising authority","key stakeholders","account Taiwan","expected revenue","business operation","years of planning","study results","business strategies","substantial displacement effect","regional hotel competitors","displacement effects of loyal","volume of hotel occupancies","controversial political events","terms of responsibility","inefficient collaboration","Typhoon Morakot","greater equality","opinions","island destination","fear of H1N1","information distribution","unfriendly local atmosphere","semi-structured interviews","risk sharing","short of expectations","stakeholder collaborations","World Games","phenomenon","potential customers","Abstract Hosting mega-","important vehicle","societal conditions","inefficiencies","investment of US","case"],"language":"en"},

A particularly interesting candidate is AAV8, which can efficiently and rapidly transduce a wide range of tissues in vivo. To further unravel the mechanisms behind AAV8 transduction, we used yeast two-hybrid analyses to screen a mouse liver complementary DNA library for cellular proteins capable of interacting with the viral capsid proteins. In total, we recovered approximately 700 clones, comprising over 300 independent genes. Sequence analyses revealed multiple hits for over 100 genes, including two encoding the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Notably, these two proteases also physically interacted with the corresponding portion of the AAV2 capsid in yeast, but not with AAV5. We demonstrate that cathepsins B and L are essential for efficient AAV2- and AAV8-mediated transduction of mammalian cells, and document the ability of purified cathepsin B and L proteins to bind and cleave intact AAV2 and AAV8 particles in vitro. These data suggest that cathepsin-mediated cleavage could prime AAV capsids for subsequent nuclear uncoating, and indicate that analysis of additional genes recovered in our screen may help to further elucidate the mechanisms behind transduction by AAV8 and related serotypes.","publish_time":"2007-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akache, Bassel; Grimm, Dirk; Shen, Xuan; Fuess, Sally; Yant, Stephen R; Glazer, Dariya S; Park, Julie; Kay, Mark A","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44108a4ae274f5b1b2e29d6f1254be02dd5bd447.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106033.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616312862; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616312862","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["L.

We analysed the Covid-19 cumulative incidence (CI) using data from the 1st to the 31st of March. We estimated that in Lombardy, the worst hit region in Italy, the observed Covid-19 CI diverged towards values lower than the ones expected in the absence of government measures approximately 7\u201310 days after the measures implementation. The Covid-19 CI growth rate peaked in Lombardy the 22nd of March and in other regions between the 24th and the 27th of March. The CI growth rate peaked in 87 out of 107 Italian provinces on average 13.6 days after the measures implementation. We projected that the CI growth rate in Lombardy should substantially slow by mid-May 2020. Other regions should follow a similar pattern. Our projections assume that the government measures will remain in place during this period. The evolution of the epidemic in different Italian regions suggests that the earlier the measures were taken in relation to the stage of the epidemic, the lower the total cumulative incidence achieved during this epidemic wave. Our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the Covid-19 CI growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid-March (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern Italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid-March to reach the high levels already present in northern regions. As several governments indicate that their aim is to \u201Cpush down\u201D the epidemic curve, the evolution of the epidemic in Italy supports the WHO recommendation that strict containment measures should be introduced as early as possible in the epidemic curve.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sebastiani, Giovanni; Massa, Marco; Riboli, Elio","journal":"Eur J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f73a54b06416cf194d1a52e48bc3c505c4c76f8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6588151f5af88755147d98440e9477673a99e76e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165256.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00631-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306149/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["epidemic curve","epidemic wave","measures implementation","extraordinary measures","CI growth rate","absence of government measures","Lombardy","Italian Government","strict containment measures","different Italian regions","regions of central","observed Covid","northern regions","southern Italy","high levels","days","relation","Italian provinces","earlier stage","evolution","total cumulative incidence","values lower","worst hit region","average","recommendation","ones","Veneto","Emilia-Romagna","data","place","rise","similar pattern","projections","analyses","governments","aim","period"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. FINDINGS: We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35\u201360). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0\u00B70009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5\u00B72%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. INTERPRETATION: News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

Abstract Objectives To describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and treatments prescribed in children with bronchiolitis admitted to our hospital. Material and methods Observational, descriptive and prospective study of children younger than 18 months, admitted to Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca of Murcia (Spain), with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, during the season of maximum incidence (December 2008-April 2009). Results A total of 235 infants were admitted, of whom 78.7% of them were aged 5 months or less. We found a positive correlation between the number of cigarettes smoked by their mothers during pregnancy and the number of hospitalization and oxygen therapy days. Children whose mothers were smokers at the time of their admission needed a greater number of oxygen therapy days. Also infants who were not breastfed needed oxygen therapy during more days. Just under one quarter (23.8%) of them had underlying diseases, with prematurity being the most frequent and a risk factor for the ongoing of oxygen therapy and hospital stay. The use of diagnostic tests, bronchodilators, corticosteroids and antibiotics was high. The onset of high temperature was associated with an increased use of antibiotics in outside and inside the hospital setting. An abnormal chest X-ray or a raised C-reactive protein was associated with a higher use of antibiotics. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the main aetiological agent, followed by Rhinovirus, Bocavirus, Adenovirus and Metapneumovirus Conclusions The majority of hospital admissions due to bronchiolitis took place during the first months of life. Infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had a worse clinical outcome. Despite the availability of clinical practice guidelines in our area, the use of diagnostic tests and pharmacological treatment was high.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1ero Fern\u00E1ndez, J.

Very recently, a new group of insect-specific viruses, the Mesoniviridae family, was discovered in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia. Here we report the first detection and isolation of a new virus belonging to Mesonivirus genus in Senegal, West Africa. The so-called Dianke virus was detected in 21 species of arthropods trapped in the eastern part of the country. Male individuals were also infected, supporting vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses. As described for other mesoniviruses, no viral replication was observed after inoculation of mammalian cells. Viral replication in mosquito cells was blocked at a temperature of 37 \u00B0C, highlighting the importance of thermal conditions in Mesonivirus host restriction. Similar to our study, where a diverse range of arthropod vectors were found infected by the new virus, several studies have detected mesonivirus infection in mosquitoes with concerns for human health. It has been shown that dual infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity. Due to their extensive geographic distribution and host range, as well as their use as potential disease control agents in vector populations, more studies should be done for a better knowledge of arthropod-restricted viruses prevalence and diversity.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diagne, Moussa M.; Gaye, Alioune; Ndione, Marie Henriette Dior; Faye, Martin; Fall, Gamou; Dieng, Idrissa; Widen, Steven G.; Wood, Thomas G.; Popov, Vsevolod; Guzman, Hilda; B\u00E2, Yamar; Weaver, Scott C.; Diallo, Mawlouth; Tesh, Robert; Faye, Ousmane; Vasilakis, Nikos; Sall, Amadou A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79f8b8851944209659f612965e7f373a941a9a0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7075714.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219303545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697989/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219303545; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197802","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","North America","Australia","Senegal","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["new virus","viral replication","new group of insect","vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses","restricted viruses prevalence","Mesonivirus genus","mesonivirus infection","Mesonivirus host restriction","host range","studies","mosquito cells","viral infectivity","increasing number of insect","so-called Dianke virus","diverse range of arthropod vectors","West Africa","better knowledge of arthropod","inoculation of mammalian cells","potential disease control agents","vector populations","mosquitoes","importance of thermal conditions","concerns","Senegal","Mesoniviridae family","Asia","North America","extensive geographic distribution","diversity","human health","dual infections","Australia","species of arthropods","study","temperature","detection","isolation","mesoniviruses","world","Male individuals","country"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan. RESULTS: Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.19\u00B116.13) years vs. (43.47\u00B113.12) years, P\u003C0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs. 5.60% exposure, P\u003C0.001). The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P\u003C0.001). The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015). More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group. There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lian, Jiang-shan; Cai, Huan; Hao, Shao-rui; Jin, Xi; Zhang, Xiao-li; Zheng, Lin; Jia, Hong-yu; Hu, Jian-hua; Zhang, Shan-yan; Yu, Guo-dong; Gu, Jue-qing; Ye, Chan-yuan; Jin, Ci-liang; Lu, Ying-feng; Sheng, Ji-fang; Yang, Yi-da","journal":"J Zhejiang Univ Sci B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b88e8f1841a7652ed289103e265d6af457cb62c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.b2000112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Zhejiang"],"keyphrases":["exposure group","control group","patients","recent exposure","history of Wuhan exposure","Wuhan exposure history","degree of COVID","clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","perspective of epidemiological","significant difference","Zhejiang Province","years old","medical records of confirmed COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","treatment data","lower level of lactate dehydrogenase","LDH","aspartate aminotransferase","sore throat","SARS-CoV","AST","symptom","BACKGROUND","study","RESULTS","rate of clustered onset","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","headache","groups","China","world"],"language":"en"},

The flow near and behind HCW is easily affected by HCW motion. The flow disturbance induced by HCW walking with swinging arms and legs is a mixing process. The walking HCW displaces air in front of it and carries air in the wake forwardly, meanwhile pressure difference drives air from two lateral sides into the wake. HCW motion (0\u20135.4 s) indeed induces a little gaseous dispersion, but the residual flow disturbance after HCW stops (5.4 s\u201325.4 s) induces more gaseous agent spread and it requires more than 30\u201360 s to approximately recover to the initial state after HCW stops. Although HCW motion indeed affects airborne transmission, but its effect is less important than ventilation design. No matter with or without HCW motion, the ceiling-level exhausts perform much better in controlling airborne transmission than the floor-level exhausts with the same air change rate (12.9 ACH). Smaller air change rate of 6 ACH experiences higher concentration and more gaseous spread than 12.9 ACH. In contrast to the realistic human walking, the simplified motion of a rectangular block produces stronger flow disturbance. Finally surface heating of HCW produces a stronger thermal body plume and enhances turbulence near HCW, thus slightly strengthens airborne transmission.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hang, Jian; Li, Yuguo; Jin, Ruiqiu","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4b11ed79efbb3cd53fbceed8c9f7bdf83af3d12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126717.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.03.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288027/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132314000894; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132314000894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFD","HCW","ACH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCW motion","HCW walking","walking HCW","heating of HCW","simplified motion","ceiling-level exhausts","floor-level exhausts","stronger flow disturbance","gaseous spread","airborne transmission","residual flow disturbance","walking motion of health care worker","Smaller air change rate","gaseous agent","little gaseous dispersion","realistic human walking","pressure difference drives air","wake","stronger thermal body plume","\u025B model","RNG","downward supplies","legs","experiences higher concentration","swinging arms","rectangular block","lateral sides","dynamic mesh technique","unsteady CFD simulations","bed isolation room","effect","turbulence","paper","mixing process","ventilation design","Abstract","contrast","initial state","matter"],"language":"en"},

Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards).

However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation.","publish_time":"2008-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bobashev, Georgiy; Morris, Robert J.; Goedecke, D.

The specificity of the assay was tested using DNA extracted from HSV-1-infected rabbit corneal epithelium cultures, HSV-2 grown on Vero cell line, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (AD-169), varicella zoster virus (VZV) (Oka-vaccine), adenovirus, Aspergillus flavus and Staphylococcus aureus. The specificity of LAMP was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing of the amplicons. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was tested using different concentrations of HSV-1 DNA. To evaluate the application of the LAMP assay in clinical diagnosis, we tested vitreous samples from 20 patients with suspected viral retinitis using LAMP and real-time PCR for HSV-1. The LAMP primers amplified only HSV-1 DNA; no LAMP products were detected with the DNAs of HSV-2, CMV, VZV, adenovirus A. flavus and S. aureus. The sequences of the positive HSV-1 LAMP products perfectly (99\u2013100%) matched the HSV-1 sequences deposited in the GenBank database. LAMP is as sensitive as real-time PCR, with the lowest detection limit being 10 copies/\u03BCL of HSV-1 DNA. Of the 20 patients with suspected viral retinitis, four tested positive for HSV-1 using real- time PCR and LAMP. A 100% concordance was observed across the two methods. The LAMP assay is a rapid, highly specific and sensitive method for the diagnosis of retinitis caused by HSV-1.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reddy, A. K.; Balne, P. K.; Reddy, R.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, which is a great public health issue leading to immunity inhibition and anincreased incidenceofinfections, has been increasing over the past ten years. The aim of this research was to systematically assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among 2019-nCoV. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Medline for observational studies up to February 25, 2020. A random effects model or fixed-effects model was applied to evaluate the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Findings In total, nine papers met the eligibility criteria. The pooled prevalence of DM was 9% (95% CI 6%\u201312%). There was obvious heterogeneity (I2 65%, p=0.004) in the prevalence of DM in these studies. The prevalence of DM in moderate patients with 2019-nCoV was 7% (95% CI 4%\u201310%). The prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV was 17% (95% CI 13%\u201321%). The prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV was significantly higher than that in moderate patients with 2019-nCoV (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.64). Interpretation To our knowledge, this work is the first report showing the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with 2019-nCoV, which is beneficial to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiang; Wang, Shoujun; Sun, Liangge; Qin, Guijun","journal":"Diabetes Res Clin Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/479ab3612c236046bd0f8b627ad3b56f94e9060e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407746/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720304502?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720304502; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108200","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV","pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus","moderate patients","severe patients","fixed-effects model","random effects model","observational studies","immunity inhibition","great public health issue","Web of Science","Embase","Medline","novel coronavirus","new strain ofcoronavirus","odds ratio","papers","PubMed","report","anincreased incidenceofinfections","I2","total","work","obvious heterogeneity","eligibility criteria","Interpretation","knowledge","Findings","Methods","confidence interval","spread","research","Abstract Background","years","aim","Wuhan","future"],"language":"en"},

Yet, they have also been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in the development of vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects. A retrospective review was conducted on CCB use in hospitalized patients in search of any difference in outcomes related to specific endpoints: survival to discharge and progression of disease leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included. Of the 77 patients that were identified, 18 survived until discharge and 59 expired. Seven patients from the expired group were excluded since they died within one day of presentation to the hospital. Five patients were excluded from the expired group since their age was above that of the eldest patient in the survival group (89 years old). With 65 patients left, 24 were found to have been administered either amlodipine or nifedipine (CCB group) and 41 were not (No-CCB group). Patients treated with a CCB were significantly more likely to survive than those not treated with a CCB: 12 (50%) survived and 12 expired in the CCB group vs. six (14.6%) that survived and 35 (85.4%) that expired in the No-CCB treatment group (P\u003C.01; p=0.0036). CCB patients were also significantly less likely to undergo intubation and mechanical ventilation. Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P\u003C.01; p=0.0026). Nifedipine and amlodipine were found to be associated with significantly improved mortality and a decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are warranted.

Wild pigs are reservoirs for pathogens of concern to domestic animals and humans. Exposure to porcine parvovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis, and Leptospira interrogans has been documented in domestic swine but data from wild pigs are lacking. The close proximity of humans, domestic animals, and wild pigs, combined with the liberal hunting of wild pigs, results in frequent opportunities for pathogen transmission. From February\u2013March 2015, blood, tissue and ectoparasite samples were collected from 47 wild pigs. Serologic testing found exposure to Brucella spp. (2%), Toxoplasma gondii (11%), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (13%), porcine circovirus type 2 (36%), pseudorabies virus (64%), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (93%), Lawsonia intracellularis (93%), and porcine parvovirus (94%). Eleven (24%) samples had low titers (1:100) to Leptospira interrogans serovars Bratislava (n=6), Icterohaemorrhagiae (n=6), Pomona (n=2), and Hardjo (n=1). Kidney samples from nine pigs with Leptospira antibodies were negative for Leptospira antigens. Numerous pigs had Metastrongylus lungworms and three had Stephanurus dentatus. Lice (Hematopinus suis) and ticks (Amblyomma breviscutatum) were also detected. No antibodies to Influenza A viruses were detected. In contrast to the previous domestic swine survey, we found evidence of numerous pathogens in wild pigs including new reports of pseudorabies virus, PRRS virus, Brucella, and Leptospira in pigs on Guam. These findings highlight that domestic swine-wild pig interactions should be prevented and precautions are needed when handling wild pigs to minimize the risk of pathogen transmission.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cleveland, Christopher A.; DeNicola, Anthony; Dubey, J.

Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria\u2019s data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria\u2019s response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations.

Here, we provide some insight into the positive side of viruses.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Tokiko; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro","journal":"Clin Transl Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da2e71598a773b197d08b2521a8fb1a2818bdd10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7029637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32099651/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1114","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of viruses","evolution of hosts","diseases","viral infections","virus infections","beneficial effects","biological functions","humans","mechanisms of replication","pathogenicity","recent studies","long history","relationships","insight","century","pathogens\u2019"],"language":"en"},

(M. azedarach) and Lobelia chinensis Lour. (L. chinensis) extracts against the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). METHODS: The anti-M. tuberculosis activity of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts were evaluated using different indicator methods such as resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) and mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 system assay. The M. tuberculosis was incubated with various concentrations (50\u2013800 \u03BCg/mL) of the extracts for 5 days in the REMA, and for 4 weeks in MGIT 960 system assay. RESULTS: M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts showed their anti-M. tuberculosis activity by strongly inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in a concentration-dependent manner in the REMA and the MGIT 960 system assay. Particularly, the methanol extract of M. azedarach and n-hexane extract of L. chinensis consistently exhibited their effects by effectively inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in MGIT 960 system for 4 weeks with a single-treatment, indicating higher anti-M. tuberculosis activity than other extracts, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations were measured as 400 \u03BCg/mL and 800 \u03BCg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts not only have unique anti-M. tuberculosis activity, but also induce the selective anti-M. tuberculosis effects by consistently inhibiting or blocking the growth of M. tuberculosis through a new pharmacological action. Therefore, this study suggests the potential of them as effective candidate agents of next-generation for developing a new anti-tuberculosis drug, as well as the advantage for utilizing traditional medicinal plants as one of effective strategies against tuberculosis.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Won Hyung; Lee, In Ah","journal":"Asian Pac J Trop Biomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93cd6674cab1ea460633039048c9abfbc5b405e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104029.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S222116911630140X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtb.2016.08.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S222116911630140X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MGIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tuberculosis activity","tuberculosis effects","growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","chinensis extracts","new anti-tuberculosis drug","anti-mycobacterial activity of Melia azedarach","MGIT","system assay","REMA","\u03BCg","Lobelia chinensis Lour","mycobacteria growth indicator tube","resazurin microtiter assay","weeks","RESULTS","different indicator methods","effective strategies","methanol extract","various concentrations","effective candidate agents","n-hexane extract of","minimum inhibitory concentrations","new pharmacological action","generation","single-treatment","traditional medicinal plants","concentration-dependent manner","advantage","potential","OBJECTIVE","days","study","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In respiratory viruses they inhibit the replication of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level. Nitazoxanide 1a, the prototype thiazolide, was originally developed as an antiparasitic agent and later repurposed for the treatment of viral respiratory infections. The second generation thiazolides following nitazoxanide, such as the 5-chloro analogue RM-5038 2a, are also broad-spectrum antiviral agents as we have reported. Both 1a and its effective circulating metabolite, tizoxanide 1b, are 5-nitrothiazole derivatives, while RM-5038 2a and its de-acetyl derivative RM-4848 2b are the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives. Recently 1a has completed phase II-III clinical trials in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a total of 2865 adults and adolescents of at least 12 months of age with viral acute respiratory illness. Since its biodisposition is primarily seen in the gastro-intestinal tract, its efficacy in systemic viral diseases requires relatively high oral doses. The chemical synthesis of new derivatives with a better systemic absorption was therefore urgently needed. In order to improve their systemic absorption, new amino-ester prodrug derivatives of 1b and RM4848 2b were prepared and tested for their animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology. RM-5061 8a in rats showed 7-fold higher blood concentration compared to 1a: absolute bioavailability increased from 3 to 20%, with a good safety profile in animal safety pharmacology and toxicology.","publish_time":"2017-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stachulski, Andrew V.; Swift, Karl; Cooper, Mark; Reynolds, Stephen; Norton, Daniel; Slonecker, Steven D.; Rossignol, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcf83e40d1a31377cd8c4a2849130aeb78da1991.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125651.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27750149/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.09.080; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523416308194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523416308194","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Canada","Australia","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["chloro derivatives","nitrothiazole derivatives","respiratory viruses","systemic viral diseases","chloro analogue RM","chemical synthesis of new derivatives","New Zealand","new amino-ester prodrug derivatives","better systemic absorption","animal safety pharmacology","animal pharmacology","viral acute respiratory illness","treatment of viral respiratory infections","toxicology","Nitazoxanide","de-acetyl derivative RM","polypharmacology agents","Abstract Thiazolides","generation thiazolides","good safety profile","broad-spectrum antiviral agents","Canada","Australia","months of age","efficacy","United States","broad spectrum of parasites","paramyxoviridae","mechanisms of action","total","high oral doses","clinical trials","replication of orthomyxoviridae","gastro-intestinal tract","adults","adolescents","bacteria","effective circulating metabolite","tizoxanide","RM4848","post-translational level","higher blood concentration","rats","pharmacokinetics","phase","prototype thiazolide","order","absolute bioavailability","antiparasitic agent","biodisposition"],"language":"en"},

Viroporins participate in multiple steps of the viral life cycle, from entry to budding. As any other membrane protein, viroporins have to find the way to bury their hydrophobic regions into the lipid bilayer. Once within the membrane, the hydrophobic helices of viroporins interact with each other to form higher ordered structures required to correctly perform their porating activities. This two-step process resembles the two-stage model proposed for membrane protein folding by Engelman and Poppot. In this review we use the membrane protein folding model as a leading thread to analyze the mechanism and forces behind the membrane insertion and folding of viroporins. We start by describing the transmembrane segment architecture of viroporins, including the number and sequence characteristics of their membrane-spanning domains. Next, we connect the differences found among viroporin families to their viral genome organization, and finalize focusing on the pathways used by viroporins in their way to the membrane and on the transmembrane helix-helix interactions required to achieve proper folding and assembly.","publish_time":"2015-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez-Gil, Luis; Mingarro, Ismael","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2057831023248265b009ed7fb7710123c69feaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4517110.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7072781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26131957/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane protein","host membrane","membrane insertion","hydrophobic helices of viroporins","transmembrane segment architecture of viroporins","proper folding","hydrophobic virus","hydrophobic regions","transmembrane helix-helix interactions","stage model","viral life cycle","viral genome organization","\u03B1-helical","viroporin families","mechanism","multiple steps","leading thread","number","homo-oligomeric hydrophilic pores","proteins","forces","sequence characteristics","entry","lipid bilayer","Engelman","Poppot","higher ordered structures","two-step process","differences","assembly","domains","pathways","review","porating activities"],"language":"en"},

Single difference in the aromatic substituent fine-tuned the biological activity of the 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives to result in two different classes of derivatives selectively active against SCV and HCV.","publish_time":"2012-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Hye Ri; Yoon, Hyunjun; Kim, Mi Kyoung; Lee, Sung Dae; Chong, Youhoon","journal":"Arch Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bfad70da896a173ccfb55c8809a3ef97d1ec8ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297745/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12272-012-0108-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives","biological activity","aromatic arylmethyl substituent","different classes of derivatives","SCV","HCV","ADK","various aromatic substituents","SARS-CoV","diketoacid moiety","arylmethyl group","Aryl diketoacid","SARS-associated coronavirus","natural flavonoid quercetin","bioisosteric relationship","dihydroxychromone pharmacophore","introduction","hepatitis C virus","Single difference","series","study"],"language":"en"},

While the characteristics of epidemic transmission are individually assessed, there are also important implicit associations between them. METHODS: A novel methodological framework was developed to overcome barriers among separate epidemic statistics and identify distinctive SARS features. Individual statistics were pair-wise linked in terms of their common features, and an integrative epidemic network was formulated. RESULTS: The study of associations between important SARS characteristics considerably enhanced the mainstream epidemic analysis and improved the understanding of the relationships between the observed epidemic determinants. The response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors was simulated, target areas were detected, critical time and relevant factors were determined. CONCLUSION: It was shown that by properly accounting for links between different SARS statistics, a data-based analysis can efficiently reveal systematic associations between epidemic determinants. The analysis can predict the temporal trend of the epidemic given its spatial pattern, to estimate spatial exposure given temporal evolution, and to infer the driving forces of SARS transmission given the spatial exposure distribution.","publish_time":"2008-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jin-Feng; Christakos, George; Han, Wei-Guo; Meng, Bin","journal":"J Public Health (Oxf)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0c1b37380fd7838db1f135fd702c8fd0cd67361.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2518065.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdn023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18441347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of epidemic transmission","separate epidemic statistics","mainstream epidemic analysis","observed epidemic determinants","different SARS statistics","response of SARS transmission","important SARS characteristics","integrative epidemic network","distinctive SARS features","various epidemic control factors","driving forces of SARS transmission","Individual statistics","spatial pattern","spatial exposure distribution","study of associations","systematic associations","important implicit associations","data-based analysis","common features","relevant factors","temporal evolution","temporal trend","pair-wise linked","target areas","critical time","terms","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","barriers","understanding","BACKGROUND","relationships","novel methodological framework","METHODS","links","spreads","countries","RESULTS","China","months","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In particular, they cause chronic infection in the immunocompromised. Some of these viruses discussed in this chapter are toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, enteroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpesviruses, and coronaviruses. Toroviruses make up a genus of the Coronaviridae family. They are a well-described cause of diarrhea in calves and horses but may also infect sheep, goats, and pigs. Picobirnaviruses are related to members of the Birnaviridae family. They are found in the feces of HIV-infected patients with diarrhea more frequently than in HIV-infected patients without diarrhea, but a virus-specific immune response was not measurable. The genus Enterovirus is of the Picornaviridae family. All enteroviruses infect man via the gastrointestinal tract where they have their first site of replication, probably in lymphoid tissues of the pharynx and gut. HIV, the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a member of the Lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex viruses, members of the Herpesviridae family, are found as the cause of colitis and esophagitis, mainly in HIV-infected patients. Coronavirus is another genus of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. They are a recognized cause of the common cold in man.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/605899fef1a2ef5521e1018f90269dc6c452abb2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(03)09037-2; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706903090372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287604/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706903090372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Coronaviridae family","HIV-infected patients","Herpesviridae family","Picornaviridae family","Retroviridae family","Birnaviridae family","feces of HIV","recognized cause","cause of colitis","well-described cause of diarrhea","Lentivirus genus","genus Enterovirus","human immunodeficiency virus","enteroviruses","herpes simplex viruses","members","picobirnaviruses","toroviruses","coronaviruses","gastrointestinal tracts","acquired immunodeficiency syndrome","majority of human viral gastroenteritis","virus-specific immune response","causative agent","calves","lymphoid tissues","AIDS","CMV","horses","chapter","herpesviruses","esophagitis","chronic infection","sheep","pharynx","gut","site of replication","Cytomegalovirus","Publisher Summary","goats","pigs","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Of 148 survivors who consented to be registered and underwent assessments at 12 months (T1) and 18 months (T2) after the MERS outbreak, 72 (48.65%) were evaluated for chronic fatigue, depressive symptoms, and PTSSs based on the Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Data from 52 subjects, who completed both assessments, were analyzed using a regression-based serial multiple mediation model (PROCESS Model 6). RESULTS: Bootstrap analyses indicated no direct effects of T1 FSS on T2 IES-R but significant positive indirect effects of T1 FSS on T2 IESR through T1 PHQ-9 and T2 PHQ-9 (B=2.1601, SE=1.3268, 95% confidence interval=0.4250\u20136.1307). In other words, both T1 PHQ-9 and T2 PHQ-9 fully mediated the relationship between T1 FSS and T2 IES. CONCLUSION: Chronic fatigue 12 months after MERS had indirect effects on prolonged PTSSs 18 months after MERS via persisting depression in MERS survivors. This finding supports the need to promote interventional programs for emerging infectious disease survivors with chronic fatigue to reduce depression and prevent prolonged PTSSs.","publish_time":"2019-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, So Hee; Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Park, Hye Yoon; Kim, Jeong Lan; Lee, Jung Jae; Lee, Haewoo; Won, Sung-Doo; Han, Woori","journal":"Psychiatry Investig","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a449e173239afb38816257e1a53811b47bf13f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6354037.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2018.10.22.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Patient Health Questionnaire-9","FSS","T2 IES","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["T1 PHQ","T2 PHQ","MERS survivors","chronic fatigue","months","T2 IES-R","T2 IESR","prolonged PTSSs","MERS outbreak","significant positive indirect effects of T1 FSS","depressive symptoms","Fatigue Severity Scale","relationship","assessments","emerging infectious disease survivors","post-traumatic stress symptoms","PROCESS Model","persisting depression","serial multiple mediation model","Middle East respiratory syndrome","interventional programs","regression","Bootstrap analyses","Impact of Event ScaleRevised","Patient Health Questionnaire","RESULTS","need","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","confidence interval","subjects","words","Data","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. RESULTS: Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children\u0027s gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Yu-Han; Ni, Wei; Wu, Qin; Li, Wen-Jie; Li, Guo-Ju; Wang, Wen-Di; Tong, Jian-Ning; Song, Xiu-Feng; Wing-Kin Wong, Gary; Xing, Quan-Sheng","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b70c124d7e761eb19c35e8924b7551c0939495a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141453.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300815; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276848/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["fecal SARS-CoV","respiratory tract","Clearance of SARS","fecal specimens","respiratory system","stools of infected children","Persistent shedding of SARS","throat swabs","weeks","days","dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","stools of pediatric patients","coronavirus disease","viral RNA","longer time","dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results","children\u0027s gastrointestinal tract","paediatric cases of COVID","laboratory","radiological characteristics","abatement of fever","Qingdao","possibility","treatment data","Shandong Province","China","infection","kindergartens","levels","contaminated fomites","OBJECTIVE","schools","CONCLUSIONS","Massive efforts","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Although many of them have viral infections, on occasion such patients may be infected with Neisseria meningitidis. We described all children aged 0\u201318 years with PRF in southern Israel during the period 2005 \u2013 2016 and compared their microbiologic, laboratory, clinical and outcome characteristics in relation to various etiologies of this syndrome. METHODS: Data were summarized from electronic patient and microbiology files. Viral diagnoses were made by serology and/or PCR. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children with PRF were admitted; 30 (43.48%), 9 (13.04%) and 30 (43.48%) had a syndrome of bacterial, viral or non-established etiology, respectively. N. meningitidis infection was diagnosed in 16/69 (23.19%) patients and in 16/30 (53.33%) patients with bacterial etiology; 14/30 (46.67%) patients suffered from a non-invasive bacterial disease (9 with Rickettsial disease). Adenovirus and Influenza B (3 and 2 cases, respectively) represented the most frequent etiologic agents among patients with viral etiology. More patients with PRF of bacterial etiology were older, of Bedouin ethnicity, looked ill on admission, had higher rates of meningitis and were treated more frequently with antibiotics compared with patients with non-bacterial PRF. Fatality rates among patients with bacterial, viral and non-established etiology were 5/30 (16.7%), 0% and 2/39 (5.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although PFR was uncommon, high rates of meningococcal infections were recorded in children with PRF, which was associated with high fatality rates. Rickettsial infections were frequent, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion for this disease in endemic geographic areas.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gawie-Rotman, Moran; Hazan, Guy; Fruchtman, Yariv; Cavari, Yuval; Ling, Eduard; Lazar, Isaac; Leibovitz, Eugene","journal":"Pediatr Neonatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/947224a63b916b8f6f70f9b9dffcdccd96988b06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102717.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875957218303735; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875957218303735; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2019.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30922715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Neisseria"],"organizations":["PRF","Influenza B"],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["patients","viral etiology","PRF of bacterial etiology","bacterial disease","viral infections","syndrome of bacterial","non-established etiology","high fatality rates","Viral diagnoses","high rates of meningococcal infections","Rickettsial disease","Rickettsial infections","evaluation of children","higher rates of meningitis","high index of suspicion","Neisseria meningitidis","meningitidis infection","frequent etiologic agents","outcome characteristics","relation","admission","Bedouin ethnicity","various etiologies","fever","purpuric rash","need","electronic patient","laboratory","southern Israel","PFR","years","endemic geographic areas","Influenza B","Data","microbiology files","serology","period","occasion","Adenovirus","cases","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","antibiotics","RESULTS","PCR"],"language":"en"},

This novel polysaccharide is noncytotoxic and nonproliferating to normal lymphocytes as well as tumor cell lines at 0\u20131000 \u03BCg/ml. It activated different subsets of the lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells (331%), T cells (102%), and B cells (39%) at 100 \u03BCg/ml concentration. The significant activation of NK cells is associated with the dose-dependent killing of tumor cells by activated normal lymphocytes in a functional assay. Immune activation by RR1 in normal lymphocytes elicited the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2 (1080 pg/ml), IL-6 (21,833 pg/ml), IL-12 p70 (50.19 pg/ml), IL-12 p40 (918.23 pg/ml), IL-18 (27.47 pg/ml), IFN- \u03B3 (90.16 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 (2225 pg/ml) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (2307 pg/ml) at 100 \u03BCg/ml concentration, while it did not induce the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 and TNF-\u03B2. The cytokine profile clearly demonstrates the Th1 pathway of T helper cell differentiation essential for cell mediated immunity, with a self-regulatory mechanism for the control of its overproduction. RR1 also activated the complements in the alternate pathway, demonstrated by a stepwise increase in C3a des Arg components. Incidentally, RR1 stimulation did not produce any oxidative stress or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lymphocytes or any significant increase in nitric oxide production.

However, it is difficult to mathematically measure how widespread the information is, especially for a general network structure. There have been studies on opinion spreading, but many studies are limited to specific spreading models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model and the independent cascade model, and it is difficult to apply these studies to various situations. In this paper, we first suggest a general opinion spreading model (GOSM) that generalizes a large class of popular spreading models. In this model, each node has one of several states, and the state changes through interaction with neighboring nodes at discrete time intervals. Next, we show that many GOSMs have a stable property that is a GOSM version of a uniform equicontinuity. Then, we provide an approximation method to approximate the expected spread size for stable GOSMs. For the approximation method, we propose a concentration theorem that guarantees that a generalized mean-field theorem calculates the expected spreading size within small error bounds for finite time steps for a slightly dense network structure. Furthermore, we prove that a \u201Csingle simulation\u201D of running the Monte Carlo simulation is sufficient to approximate the expected spreading size. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks and show that our generalized approximation method well predicts the state density of the various models, especially in graphs with a large number of nodes. Experimental results show that the generalized mean-field approximation and a single Monte Carlo simulation converge as shown in the concentration theorem.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choe, Byeongjin; Lin, Yishi; Lim, Sungsu; Lui, John C.

Our account, based on statistical mechanics of open systems, clarifies that it is impossible to predict accurately epidemic courses because everything depends on everything else. Nonetheless, the thermodynamic theory yields a comprehensive and analytical view of the epidemic.

Abstract Dialysis patients are a risk group for SARS-CoV2 infection and possibly further complications, but we have little information. The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the first month of the SARS-Cov2 pandemic in a hospital haemodialysis (HD) unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID19 (almost 1000 patients in 100000 h). In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit. We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV2 PCR testing. Fever was the most frequent symptom, 50% had lymphopenia and 18.4% \u003C95% O2 saturation. Sixteen (43.2%) patients required hospital admission and 6 (16.2%) died. We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport. In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-Cov2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases. Conclusions: We detected a high prevalence of COVID19 with a high percentage detected by screening; hence the need for proactive diagnosis to stop the pandemic. Most cases are managed as outpatients, however severe symptoms are also appearing and mortality to date is 16.2%. In terms of staff, 20% have required sick leave in relation to COVID19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albalate, M.; Arribas, P.; Torres, E.; Cintra, M.; Alc\u00E1zar, R.; Puerta, M.; Ortega, M.; Procaccini, F.; Martin, J.; Jim\u00E9nez, E.; Fernandez, I.; de Sequera, P.","journal":"Nefrologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3e6cbd3c4106528a003b043a60097b19313ab78.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0211699520300436; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nefro.2020.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0211699520300436?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Incapacidad Laboral Transitoria"],"locations":["Madrid"],"keyphrases":["The aim of","the experience of the first month of the SARS","In the form of a diary","of whom","the incidence of COVID19 in patients and health staff","In terms of staff","some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit","had COVID19","unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID19","stop the pandemic","PCR SARS","incidencia de COVID19","hence the need for","we present the actions undertaken","Cov2 pandemic in a hospital","pacientes","had lymphopenia and","required some period of sick leave","We detected a high prevalence of COVID19 with a high percentage detected by screening","patients required hospital admission and","through subsequent screening of those who","CoV2 PCR testing","elevada prevalencia de COVID19","Fever was the most frequent symptom","were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session","patients on HD","CoV2 infection and possibly further complications","were confirmed as SARS","had not undergone SARS","also appearing and mortality","have required sick leave in relation","We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport","Cov2 PCR cases by occupational health","We started with","risk group for SARS","had compatible symptoms","ILT","Abstract Dialysis patients","Most cases","but we have little information","were considered likely cases","personal sanitario","cribado realizado","pandemia","however severe symptoms","unidad hospitalaria","test diagn\u00F3stico","Salud Laboral","saturaci\u00F3n de O2","O2 saturation","sintomatolog\u00EDa compatible","managed as outpatients","periodo de Incapacidad Laboral Transitoria","until that","almost","temporary disability","diagnosis","work","paper","elevado porcentaje detectado","caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas","cabo","Conclusions","infecci\u00F3n","hemodi\u00E1lisis","people","forma ambulatoria","cuadros graves","grupo de riesgo","triaje","fiebre","trabajo","experiencia","acciones","resultado","necesidad","distrito madrile\u00F1o","informaci\u00F3n","agrupamiento de contagio","turnos","s\u00EDntomas detectados","linfopenia","mayor\u00EDa","mortalidad","diario","Conclusiones","posteriori","personas involucradas","complicaciones","Sixteen","inicio","relaci\u00F3n","momento","ingreso hospitalario","transporte colectivo","casos probables","sesi\u00F3n","objetivo","died"],"language":"es"},

Radiolabelled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 125I excretion in the feces over a 10 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgG1 clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 125I present in the gastrointestinal tract of 10 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 125I accounted for 32% of the serum 125I-IgG1 clearance. Protein-bound 125I was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 125I-IgG1 clearance, and retained 65% of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody. The discrepancy between the fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 125I in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgG1 clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.","publish_time":"1987-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Besser, T.

Several animal models have been established to study disease pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and therapeutic agents. Here, we developed transgenic (Tg) mice on a C57BL/6 background; these mice expressed human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, under the control of an endogenous hDPP4 promoter. We then characterized this mouse model of MERS-CoV. The expression profile of hDPP4 in these mice was almost equivalent to that in human tissues, including kidney and lung; however, hDPP4 was overexpressed in murine CD3-positive cells within peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Intranasal inoculation of young and adult Tg mice with MERS-CoV led to infection of the lower respiratory tract and pathological evidence of acute multifocal interstitial pneumonia within 7 days, with only transient loss of body weight. However, the immunopathology in young and adult Tg mice was different. On day 5 or 7 postinoculation, lungs of adult Tg mice contained higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with migration of macrophages. These results suggest that the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection in the Tg mouse is age dependent. The mouse model described here will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and host mediators that protect against MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are endemic in the Middle East and a threat to public health worldwide. Rodents are not susceptible to the virus because they do not express functional receptors; therefore, we generated a new animal model of MERS-CoV infection based on transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4). The pattern of hDPP4 expression in this model was similar to that in human tissues (except lymphoid tissue). In addition, MERS-CoV was limited to the respiratory tract. Here, we focused on host factors involved in immunopathology in MERS-CoV infection and clarified differences in antiviral immune responses between young and adult transgenic mice. This new small-animal model could contribute to more in-depth study of the pathology of MERS-CoV infection and aid development of suitable treatments.","publish_time":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Okamura, Tadashi; Shimizu, Yukiko; Kotani, Osamu; Sato, Hironori; Sekimukai, Hanako; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Suzuki, Tadaki; Sato, Yuko; Takeda, Makoto; Tashiro, Masato; Hasegawa, Hideki; Nagata, Noriyo","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27c24bc25e5f22f0771e1fcb3276c728fb446828.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6401458.xml.json","url":"https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/6/e01818-18.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01818-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","immunopathology of MERS","mouse model of MERS","new animal model of MERS","adult transgenic mice","lungs of adult Tg mice","Tg mouse","human tissues","pattern of hDPP4 expression","expression profile of hDPP4","new small-animal model","acute respiratory distress","IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lower respiratory tract","endogenous hDPP4 promoter","human CD26","human DPP4","lymphoid tissues","animal models","Intranasal inoculation of young","understanding of disease pathogenesis","host mediators","host factors","in-depth study","express functional receptors","pathological evidence of acute multifocal interstitial pneumonia","antiviral immune responses","clarified differences","higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines","peripheral blood","chemokines","days","murine CD3-positive cells","infections","organ failure","mild illness","aid development of suitable treatments","postinoculation","dipeptidyl peptidase","background","control","vaccines","threat","kidney","C57BL","transient loss of body weight","public health","migration of macrophages","death","therapeutic agents","Rodents","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

The cat also had multiple nodules in the liver but exhibited no other clinical signs consistent with classical feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), such as pleural effusion or ascites, uveitis or neurological symptoms. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the cutaneous nodule revealed pyogranulomatous dermatitis with intralesional macrophages laden with feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of a cutaneous sample revealed a single nucleotide substitution in the spike protein gene of FCoV (mutation M1058L), which is consistent with an FCoV genotype commonly associated with FIP. The cat received a blood transfusion and supportive therapy, but the owner declined to continue the treatments owing to poor response. The cat was lost to follow-up 5 months after discharge. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This report describes a case of a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule in which the evidence of amino acid changes in the spike protein gene identified by RT-PCR were consistent with an FCoV genotype commonly seen in cases of FIP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of cutaneous disease associated with the mutated FCoV that was confirmed by molecular diagnostic testing.","publish_time":"2018-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osumi, Takafumi; Mitsui, Ikki; Leutenegger, Christian M; Okabe, Ryo; Ide, Kaori; Nishifuji, Koji","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f91911b6a25c970324854df7b87c550ae7fb878f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6149024.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116918801385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30263143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cutaneous nodule","FCoV genotype","mutated FCoV","spike protein gene of FCoV","case of cutaneous disease","cutaneous sample","feline coronavirus","RT-PCR","report","cases of FIP","CASE SUMMARY","clinical signs consistent","month-old spayed female Singapura cat","non-pruritic erythematous nodule","classical feline infectious peritonitis","intralesional macrophages laden","pyogranulomatous dermatitis","single nucleotide substitution","evidence of amino acid changes","mutation M1058L","ascites","uveitis","supportive therapy","pleural effusion","upper lip","immunohistochemical analyses","liver","blood transfusion","Real-time reverse transcription","neurological symptoms","NOVEL INFORMATION","treatments","owner","RELEVANCE","molecular diagnostic testing","follow-up","months","multiple nodules","antigen","poor response","discharge","knowledge","best"],"language":"en"},

Here, we employ a bioinformatics method, Prediction of T Cell Epitopes for Cancer Therapy, to analyze sequencing data from neuroblastoma patients and identify a recurrent anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation (ALK R1275Q) that leads to two high affinity neoepitopes when expressed in complex with common HLA alleles. Analysis of the X-ray structures of the two peptides bound to HLA-B*15:01 reveals drastically different conformations with measurable changes in the stability of the protein complexes, while the self-epitope is excluded from binding due to steric hindrance in the MHC groove. To evaluate the range of HLA alleles that could display the ALK neoepitopes, we used structure-based Rosetta comparative modeling calculations, which accurately predict several additional high affinity interactions and compare our results with commonly used prediction tools. Subsequent determination of the X-ray structure of an HLA-A*01:01 bound neoepitope validates atomic features seen in our Rosetta models with respect to key residues relevant for MHC stability and T cell receptor recognition. Finally, MHC tetramer staining of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-matched donors shows that the two neoepitopes are recognized by CD8\u002B T cells.

Compared with animals, plant genomes encode numerous aquaporins, which display a large variety of subcellular localization patterns. More specifically, plant aquaporins of the plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) subfamily were first described as plasma membrane (PM)-resident proteins, but recent research has demonstrated that the trafficking and subcellular localization of these proteins are complex and highly regulated. In the past few years, PIPs emerged as new model proteins to study subcellular sorting and membrane dynamics in plant cells. At least two distinct sorting motifs (one cytosolic, the other buried in the membrane) are required to direct PIPs to the PM. Hetero-oligomerization and interaction with SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein attachment protein receptors) also influence the subcellular trafficking of PIPs. In addition to these constitutive processes, both the progression of PIPs through the secretory pathway and their dynamics at the PM are responsive to changing environmental conditions.","publish_time":"2014-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevalier, Adrien S.; Chaumont, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Plant Cell Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7094d1604057f9ab203d5d734eaebdadf3e894c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25520405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subcellular trafficking of PIPs","subcellular sorting","membrane dynamics","plant aquaporins","plasma membrane intrinsic protein","resident proteins","progression of PIPs","direct PIPs","small channel proteins","new model proteins","numerous aquaporins","PM","plant genomes","plant cells","large variety of subcellular localization patterns","sensitive factor protein attachment protein receptors","small neutral molecules","distinct sorting motifs","soluble N-ethylmaleimide","diffusion of water","SNAREs","subfamily","interaction","Hetero-oligomerization","biological membranes","secretory pathway","years","recent research","animals","constitutive processes","environmental conditions","addition","past"],"language":"en"},

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. METHODS: Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray\u2122 Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. RESULTS: Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season. Since all patients shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, expanded surveillance of detailed exposure history for suspected patients and application of rapid detection tools are highly recommended.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsih, Wen-Hsin; Cheng, Meng-Yu; Ho, Mao-Wang; Chou, Chia-Huei; Lin, Po-Chang; Chi, Chih-Yu; Liao, Wei-Chih; Chen, Chih-Yu; Leong, Lih-Ying; Tien, Ni; Lai, Huan-Cheng; Lai, Yi-Chyi; Lu, Min-Chi","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/897a28fd088b8b54f162a00ec62bd0f57f6e6bf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32220574/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300682; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300682","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Taiwan Centers for Disease Control","China Medical University Hospital"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["symptomatic patients","suspected patients","non-COVID","non- COVID","respiratory specimen","respiratory infections","seasonal respiratory pathogens","testing of SARS","persistence of positive SARS-CoV","results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel","Disease Control","Coronavirus disease","SARS-CO-V","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","laboratory findings","control of infection","Causative pathogens","particular pathogens","exposure contact histories","radiologic findings","laboratory data","Taiwan Centers","clinical presentations","flu season","surveillance of detailed exposure history","China Medical University Hospital","persistent cough","mild illness","temporal fever","travel","application of rapid detection tools","endemic area","identified comorbidities","lung interstitial infiltrates","case patient","rRT-PCR","comparison","Wuhan","Hubei province","isolation rooms","prevention","BACKGROUND","recovery","METHODS","persons","countries"],"language":"en"},

The epidemic spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas. Reanalysis of all available epidemiological data resulted in a total of 5327 probable cases of SARS, of whom 343 died. The resulting case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries or areas, and this difference could only partly be explained by younger age of patients and higher number of community acquired infections. Analysis of the impact of interventions demonstrated that strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response was the most important factor to control SARS in mainland China, whereas the most stringent control measures were all initiated when the epidemic was already dying down. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited, much consumption was merely postponed, but for Beijing irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector were considerable. An important finding from a cohort study was that many former SARS patients currently suffer from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of the treatment with corticosteroids during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable information and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.","publish_time":"2011-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Wu-Chun; de Vlas, Sake J.; Richardus, Jan Hendrik","journal":"Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d83a2c20f409e7be9dbe6e9c8c62ddaf2b506c48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3892599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470901/; https://doi.org/10.4081/idr.2011.e2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","SARS patients","probable cases of SARS","mainland China","surrounding areas","comprehensive documentation","important factor","important finding","Beijing irrecoverable losses","Chinese health system","younger age of patients","long-term economic consequence","stringent control measures","comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system","severe acute respiratory syndrome","outbreaks","total","lessons relevant","coordinated response","strong political commitment","valuable information","higher number of community","tourist sector","large geographical extent","impact of interventions","fundamental reforms","cohort study","resulting case fatality ratio","CFR","available epidemiological data","months","avascular osteonecrosis","emerging infectious diseases","published series of studies","review","Reanalysis","infections","treatment","corticosteroids","Guangdong Province","countries","country","difference","consumption","spring","paper","half"],"language":"en"},

HCV infection strongly induces host responses, such as the activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy and the innate immune response. Upon HCV infection, the host induces the interferon (IFN)-mediated frontline defense to limit virus replication. Conversely, HCV employs diverse strategies to escape host innate immune surveillance. Type I IFN elicits its antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these ISGs participate in IFN-mediated anti-HCV actions remain largely unknown. In this review, we first outline the signaling pathways known to be involved in the production of type I IFN and ISGs and the tactics that HCV uses to subvert innate immunity. Then, we summarize the effector mechanisms of scaffold ISGs known to modulate IFN function in HCV replication. We also highlight the potential functions of emerging ISGs, which were identified from genome-wide siRNA screens, in HCV replication. Finally, we discuss the functions of several cellular determinants critical for regulating host immunity in HCV replication. This review will provide a basis for understanding the complexity and functionality of the pleiotropic IFN system in HCV infection. Elucidation of the specificity and the mode of action of these emerging ISGs will also help to identify novel cellular targets against which effective HCV therapeutics can be developed.","publish_time":"2014-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Mun-Teng; Chen, Steve S-L","journal":"Cell Mol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfa3dbdc7b28b9075361efcb919d3a1b19636edd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4712384.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2014.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25544499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","HCV replication","anti-HCV actions","effective HCV therapeutics","IFN function","wide array of IFN","pleiotropic IFN system","host immunity","virus replication","potential functions of emerging ISGs","host responses","effector mechanisms of scaffold ISGs","innate immunity","innate immune response","review","antiviral actions","immune surveillance","production of type","cellular determinants critical","novel cellular targets","unfolded protein response","hepatitis C virus","genome-wide siRNA screens","major viral cause of chronic liver disease","autophagy","functionality","activation","stimulated genes","mode of action","frontline defense","diverse strategies","complexity","interferon","tactics","specificity","steatosis","basis","cirrhosis","Elucidation","hepatocellular carcinoma","pathways"],"language":"en"},

It is associated with severe neurological complications and has caused significant mortalities in recent large-scale outbreaks. Currently, no effective vaccine or specific clinical therapy is available against EV71. METHODS: Unmodified 21 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and classic 2(\u2032)-modified (2(\u2032)-O-methylation or 2(\u2032)-fluoro modification) siRNAs were designed to target highly conserved 5(\u2032) untranslated region (UTR) of the EV71 genome and employed as anti-EV71 agents. Real-time TaqMan RT-PCR, western blot analysis and plaque assays were carried out to evaluate specific viral inhibition by the siRNAs. RESULTS: Transfection of rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells with siRNAs targeting the EV71 genomic 5(\u2032) UTR significantly delayed and alleviated the cytopathic effects of EV71 infection, increased cell viability in EV71-infected RD cells. The inhibitory effect on EV71 replication was sequence-specific and dosage-dependent, with significant corresponding decreases in viral RNA, VP1 protein and viral titer. Appropriate 2(\u2032)-modified siRNAs exhibited similar RNA interference (RNAi) activity with dramatically increased serum stability in comparison with unmodified counterparts. CONCLUSION: Sequences were identified within the highly conserved 5(\u2032) UTR that can be targeted to effectively inhibit EV71 replication through RNAi strategies. Appropriate 2(\u2032)-modified siRNAs provide a promising approach to optimizing siRNAs to overcome barriers on RNAi-based antiviral therapies for broader administration.","publish_time":"2012-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Jun-Xia; Nie, Xiao-Jing; Lei, Ying-Feng; Ma, Chao-Feng; Xu, Dong-Liang; Li, Biao; Xu, Zhi-Kai; Zhang, Guo-Cheng","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80637e7403f730cb2e22a4af53fade48a1e42a87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3438048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889374/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-19-73","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV71 replication","EV71 genome","EV71 genomic","modified siRNAs","anti-EV71 agents","EV71-infected RD cells","cytopathic effects of EV71 infection","UTR","viral RNA","specific viral inhibition","sequence-specific","viral titer","RNAi strategies","specific clinical therapy","significant mortalities","unmodified counterparts","increased cell viability","significant corresponding decreases","increased serum stability","similar RNA interference","western blot analysis","activity","VP1 protein","nucleotide small interfering RNAs","dosage-dependent","Real-time TaqMan RT-PCR","hand","foot","etiological role","plaque assays","antiviral therapies","comparison","barriers","effective vaccine","Transfection of rhabdomyosarcoma","promising approach","recent large-scale outbreaks","METHODS","infectious agent","inhibitory effect","severe neurological complications","broader administration","untranslated region","mouth disease","RESULTS","Sequences","fluoro modification","BACKGROUND","Enterovirus","O-methylation","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Bronchoalveolar lavage of the patients isolated a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) as the pathogen.1 The pulmonary infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 14 March 2020, the WHO reported 142,651 worldwide cases with 5,393 deaths.2 Despite the imposition of strict quarantine rules and restricted travel within and from China, the infection has spread rapidly affecting countries worldwide. It continues to escalate. As of 14 March 2020, 797 UK cases have been confirmed, with 10 deaths.3 Testing currently involves a laboratory test from swab samples obtained from the respiratory tract (most commonly a single nose and throat swab). The WHO currently classifies cases into three potential categories: (1) suspected, (2) probable, and (3) confirmed. Suspected cases are primarily those with a febrile respiratory illness and history of travel to a country or region reporting local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. In the past few weeks, changes to diagnostic criteria (using imaging as an adjunct to real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) has led to an increase in reported cases. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 The majority of patients present with a lower respiratory tract infection comprising fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia. Although most patients have a mild illness, 17\u201329% of patients are reported to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).4,5 Mortality rates are estimated at 3.6%.6 An elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia (\u003C1,100 \u03BC/L) are characteristic7 Radiology departments should be prepared for an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 and new diagnoses or risk stratification may be imaging based. As such, it is important for radiologists to be familiar with the potential spectrum of imaging findings, as well as set out protocols to limit contamination and spread. Chest imaging findings in COVID-19 Initial findings Initial imaging with chest radiograph (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) may be normal in COVID-19. Disease severity and timing of imaging appear to impact on the rates of normal baseline imaging. In non-severe disease, up to 18% of patients have a normal initial CXR or CT, but only 3% in severe disease.8 In a series of 121 symptomatic patients, a normal CT was found in 56% of patients scanned within 2 days of symptom onset, whereas normal scans were observed in only 9% and 4% of patients if imaged 3\u20135 days or 6\u201312 days from symptoms, respectively.9 Therefore, radiographic abnormalities are almost certain to be present on CT following 6 days of symptoms. Furthermore, Shi et al. have reported radiological abnormality, predominantly ground-glass opacity (GGO), in subclinical disease, where 15 patients were imaged using CT before symptom onset.10 As such, the precise time when imaging becomes abnormal is heterogeneous and the disease should not be excluded based on a normal CT examination acquired early after symptom onset. When imaging is abnormal, there are some common features. CXR typically shows patchy or diffuse asymmetric airspace opacities, similar to other causes of coronavirus pneumonias.4 The most common initial CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are bilateral, subpleural GGO, ill-defined margins, and a slight right lower lobe predilection10; however, the initial imaging findings are not organism specific and can overlap with H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and other atypical pneumonias11 Temporal evolution of findings With increased time between symptom onset and imaging, the pattern of radiological findings progresses from focal unilateral abnormality to diffuse bilateral opacities with evolution to consolidation, reticulation, and mixed-pattern disease involving more lung segments.10 The pattern of CT disease may have prognostic implications, with consolidation being reported in nearly all patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) support and GGO in those not requiring ICU.5 \u201CCrazy-paving\u201D pattern and the \u201Catoll\u201D sign is also reported with greater time from symptom onset.9 In a cohort of 21 patients with COVID-19 who recovered, late-stage CT findings (14 days or longer) showed varying degrees of clearing but signs may persist for more than 1 month after initial detection.12 Uncommon imaging findings Imaging features that are only rarely encountered include pneumothorax, cavitation, or lymphadenopathy.13 Features such as pleural effusion, extensive tiny lung nodules, tree in bud, and lymphadenopathy may well suggest bacterial superinfection or an alternative diagnosis.14","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodrigues, J.C.L.; Hare, S.

The percentage of Caudovirales was higher in reservoirs whereas the percentages of Dicistroviridae, Microviridae and Circoviridae were higher in tributaries. Reservoirs showed a higher Shannon-index virome diversity compared to upstream tributaries. Land use (urbanized, agriculture and parkland areas) influenced the characteristics of the virome distribution pattern. Dicistroviridae and Microviridae were enriched in urbanized tributaries while Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae were enriched in parkland reservoirs. Several sequences closely related to the emerging zoonotic virus, cyclovirus, and the human-related virus (human picobirnavirus), were also detected.

Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5-7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9-11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy. Considering that the COVID-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1, a dietary regimen modification in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of patients, improving their outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Messina, Giovanni; Polito, Rita; Monda, Vincenzo; Cipolloni, Luigi; Di Nunno, Nunzio; Di Mizio, Giulio; Murabito, Paolo; Carotenuto, Marco; Messina, Antonietta; Pisanelli, Daniela; Valenzano, Anna; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Scarinci, Alessia; Monda, Marcellino; Sessa, Francesco","journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21093104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["infection","mortality rate of COVID","IL","care of patients","China","outcomes","TNF-\u03B1 inhibitor drugs","possible therapy","dietary intervention","dietary regimen modification","percentage of positive patients","intensive care units","World Health Organization","Wuhan City","consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines","pneumonia of unknown origin","acute respiratory syndrome","order","Hubei Province","different hospitals","recent evidence","cluster of cases","levels of adiponectin","consideration","necessary measures","rest","pandemic","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

RNA of the defective interfering virus was not observed in the persistently infected cells by Northern blot analysis. SARS-CoV diluted to 2 PFU failed to establish persistence, suggesting that some particular viruses in the seed virus did not induce persistent infection. Interestingly, a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, was down-regulated in persistently infected cells. G418-selected clones established from parent Vero E6 cells, which were transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, were infected with SARS-CoV, resulting in a potential cell population capable of persistence in Vero E6 cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that signaling pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K)/Akt were activated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Previous studies also showed that the activation of p38 MAPK by viral infection-induced apoptosis, and a weak activation of Akt was not sufficient to protect from apoptosis. In the present study, we showed that the inhibitors of JNK and PI3K/Akt inhibited the establishment of persistence, but those of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK; as an inhibitor for ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK did not. These results indicated that two signaling pathways of JNK and PI3K/Akt were important for the establishment of persistence in Vero E6 cells.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6f498d287af817fe9cf8dca33bb01163db27642.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125767.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443905000529; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443905000529","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PFU","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","infected Vero E6 cells","parent Vero E6 cells","SARS-CoV","establishment of persistence","activation of p38 MAPK","ERK kinase","PI3K","Abstract Persistence","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","pathways of JNK","weak activation of Akt","N-terminal protein kinase","pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase","ERK1","inhibitors of JNK","previous studies","potential cell population capable of persistence","viral infection-induced apoptosis","seed virus","viral receptor","persistent infection","defective interfering virus","MEK","G418-selected clones","angiotensin","enzyme","particular viruses","Northern blot analysis","phosphatidylinositol","neomycin resistance gene","plasmid","RNA","PFU","present study","results"],"language":"en"},

The econometric model, consisting of three equations due to the endogeneity of the tourist arrivals and length of stay variables in the tourist expenditures equation, is estimated simultaneously using the generalized method of moments. The results indicate that the US FAA downgrade and the EU ban impact monthly tourist receipts negatively in the short term while the downgrade also impacts tourist expenditures in the long term. Moreover, the ban impacts length of stay negatively in the short and long term while the downgrade impacts length of stay negatively only in the long term. The substantial decline in tourism receipts from 2008 to 2010 despite an increasing trend in tourist arrivals is due to the shorter stay of tourists, indicating that high-spending tourists have not returned following the downgrade and ban.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manuela, Wilfred S.; de Vera, Manuel J.","journal":"Transport Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b39504c7b4ad90b78f573d95b5f72d15b7d889fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125873.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X15000724; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.05.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288381/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967070X15000724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US FAA","Philippine","EU"],"locations":["Philippines","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["tourist arrivals","length of stay","tourist destinations","downgrade impacts length","tourist expenditures equation","ban impacts length","short term","long term","EU ban impact monthly tourist receipts","US FAA downgrade","shorter stay of tourists","EU ban of Philippine carriers","long-term impact","Philippine civil aviation system","tourism receipts","high-spending tourists","monthly time series data","international aviation safety standards","self-inflicted wounds","variables","Southeast Asia","government","failure","country","endogeneity","equations","substantial decline","increasing trend","results","generalized method of moments","econometric model","article","Philippines","goals"],"language":"en"},

Few studies have addressed the basic physical properties of long single-stranded RNAs. Long RNAs with nonrepeating sequences usually adopt highly ramified secondary structures and are better described as branched polymers. To test whether a branched polymer model can estimate the overall sizes of large RNAs, we employed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to examine the hydrodynamic radii of a broad spectrum of biologically important RNAs, ranging from viral genomes to long noncoding regulatory RNAs. The relative sizes of long RNAs measured at low ionic strength correspond well to those predicted by two theoretical approaches that treat the effective branching associated with secondary structure formation\u2014one employing the Kramers theorem for calculating radii of gyration, and the other featuring the metric of maximum ladder distance. Upon addition of multivalent cations, most RNAs are found to be compacted as compared with their original, low ionic-strength sizes. These results suggest that sizes of long RNA molecules are determined by the branching pattern of their secondary structures. We also experimentally validate the proposed computational approaches for estimating hydrodynamic radii of single-stranded RNAs, which use generic RNA structure prediction tools and thus can be universally applied to a wide range of long RNAs.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borodavka, Alexander; Singaram, Surendra W.; Stockley, Peter G.; Gelbart, William M.; Ben-Shaul, Avinoam; Tuma, Roman","journal":"Biophysical Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2f395433a6b6b36c852fc106c037ca725468bb5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/84dab2b80ab9e0964589660b568a09d687846f47.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4986b7765ef8df0192f45b087cdae599a0aaf77e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5113152.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349516309419; http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349516309419/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27851933/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349516309419; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2016.10.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kramers"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relative sizes of long RNAs","important RNAs","wide range of long RNAs","sizes of long RNA molecules","overall sizes of large RNAs","noncoding regulatory RNAs","basic physical properties of long single-stranded RNAs","low ionic-strength sizes","RNA viruses","hydrodynamic radii of single","radii of gyration","secondary structure formation","low ionic strength","ramified secondary structures","generic RNA structure prediction tools","effective branching","viral genomes","branching pattern","theoretical approaches","branched polymers","proposed computational approaches","branched polymer model","nonrepeating sequences","fluorescence correlation spectroscopy","core of gene regulation","broad spectrum","Kramers theorem","kingdoms of life","metric of maximum ladder distance","studies","addition of multivalent cations","results"],"language":"en"},

These strategies, namely, prioritized, random, follow links and contact tracing, are compared across networks using extensive simulations with disease parameters relevant for viruses such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09. Two scenarios for a network SIR model are considered. First, a model with a given transmission rate is studied. Second, a model with a given initial growth rate is considered, because the initial growth rate is commonly used to impute the transmission rate from incidence curves and to predict the course of an epidemic. Since a vaccine may not be readily available for a new virus, the case of a delay in the start of vaccination is also considered in addition to the case of no delay. It is found that network topology can have a larger impact on the spread of the disease than the choice of vaccination strategy. Simulations also show that the network structure has a large effect on both the course of an epidemic and the determination of the transmission rate from the initial growth rate. The effect of delay in the vaccination start time varies tremendously with network topology. Results show that, without the knowledge of network topology, predictions on the peak and the final size of an epidemic cannot be made solely based on the initial exponential growth rate or transmission rate. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the topology of realistic contact networks when evaluating vaccination strategies.","publish_time":"2013-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Junling; van den Driessche, P.; Willeboordse, Frederick H.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfe4a7ac44f9c7fce218b3b428a4ecc40ebc0f8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094094.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519313000258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23376579/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519313000258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["given transmission rate","given initial growth rate","initial exponential growth rate","knowledge of network topology","network SIR model","network structure","start of vaccination","number of vaccination strategies","epidemic","common network topologies","topology of realistic contact networks","effect of delay","meta-random networks","choice of vaccination strategy","spread","SIR type disease","course","case","disease parameters relevant","extensive simulations","contact tracing","large effect","viruses","scale-free","small world","peak","predictions","larger impact","pandemic influenza H1N1","incidence curves","determination","time","final size","new virus","links","effects","addition","scenarios","importance","vaccine","Results"],"language":"en"},

The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV may be critical for pathogenicity. This study sought to discover the host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV NP. RESULTS: Using surface plasmon resonance biomolecular interaction analysis (SPR/BIA) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, we found that only the proteasome subunit p42 from human fetal lung diploid fibroblast (2BS) cells bound to SARS-CoV NP. This interaction was confirmed by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pulldown technique. The co-localization signal of SARS-CoV NP and proteasome subunit p42 in 2BS cells was detected using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. p42 is a subunit of the 26S proteasome; this large, multi-protein complex is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is involved in a variety of basic cellular processes and inflammatory responses. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report that SARS-CoV NP interacts with the proteasome subunit p42 within host cells. These data enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV pathogenicity and the means by which SARS-CoV interacts with host cells.","publish_time":"2010-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qin; Li, Chuan; Zhang, Quanfu; Wang, Tao; Li, Jiandong; Guan, Wuxiang; Yu, Jianshi; Liang, Mifang; Li, Dexin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e339ee119ba0065cad4c40897cd1bc9dd0f118a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2894783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20478047/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-99","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","SPR/BIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV NP","CoV pathogenicity","proteasome subunit p42","S proteasome","host cells","molecular mechanisms of SARS","BS cells","co-localization signal of SARS","ubiquitin-proteasome pathway","nucleocapsid protein","host proteins","multi-protein complex","fusion protein pulldown technique","glutathione S-transferase","surface plasmon resonance biomolecular interaction analysis","human fetal lung diploid fibroblast","GST","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","ionization time of flight","BIA","component","MALDI-TOF","laser desorption","matrix","indirect immunofluorescence","spreads","variety of basic cellular processes","inflammatory responses","means","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","understanding","report","high case-mortality rate","mass spectrometry","confocal microscopy","knowledge","data","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Regular and proper hand hygiene by caregivers and food handlers in particular is essential to decontaminate hands and potentially interrupt such spread. What would be considered a proper decontamination of hands? Handwashing with regular soap and water is often considered sufficient, but what of hygienic handwash and handrub antiseptic products? Are they more effective? The evidence suggests that some clearly are. Activity against bacteria may not reflect the ability of hygienic hand antiseptics to deal with viruses, especially those that are nonenveloped. In spite of the acknowledged importance of hands as vehicles for viruses, there is a lack of suitable regulatory mechanism for handwash or handrub products to make claims of efficacy against viruses. This is in contrast with the ability of general-purpose disinfectants to make antiviral claims, although transmission of viruses from surfaces other than those of reusable medical devices may play only a minor role in virus transmission. This review discusses the (1) recent information on the relative importance of viruses as human pathogens, particularly those causing enteric and respiratory infections; (2) the survival of relevant viruses on human hands in comparison with common gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; (3) the potential of hands to transfer or receive such contamination on casual contact; (4) role of hands in the spread of viruses; (5) the potential of hygienic measures to eliminate viruses from contaminated hands; (6) relative merits of available protocols to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses; and (7) factors considered crucial in any tests to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses. In addition, this review proposes surrogate viruses in such testing and discusses issues for additional consideration by researchers, manufacturers, end-users, and regulators.

However, the disease burden due to RSV has not been systematically summarized in China. METHOD: A systematic search was performed in the Chinese BioMedical Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database and PubMed to identify available published RSV studies in China. RESULTS: A total of 489 641 patients with ARTIs from 135 studies were included in the analysis. Among patients with ARTIs, RSV accounted for 18.7% (95% confidence interval CI 17.1\u201320.5%). The prevalence of RSV was highest in infants (26.5%, 95% CI 23.7\u201329.5%) and lowest in those aged \u226516 years (2.8%, 95% CI 1.3\u20136.1). A higher prevalence of RSV was seen in inpatients (22%, 95% CI 19.9\u201324.2%) than in outpatients (14%, 95% CI 9.6\u201319.9%). RSV type A accounted for 63.1% (95% CI 52.3\u201372.8%) of all RSV infections. RSV infections occurred mainly in winter and spring. The most common clinical manifestations were cough, production of sputum, wheezing and fever. CONCLUSION: RSV is the leading cause of viral ARTIs in China, particularly in infants and young children. Our findings are valuable for guiding the selection of appropriate therapies for ARTIs and implementation of preventive measures against RSV infections. Our data further supports the development of a successful RSV vaccine as a high priority.","publish_time":"2015-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yaowen; Yuan, Lichao; Zhang, Yongming; Zhang, Xiuping; Zheng, Minghuan; Kyaw, Moe H","journal":"Journal of global health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9538da236dd88828d491e85addc5b2c6669e7c5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4676581.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.05.020417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26682049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARTIs"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["RSV infections","higher prevalence of RSV","successful RSV vaccine","available published RSV studies","confidence interval CI","leading cause of viral ARTIs","infants","China National Knowledge Infrastructure","Wanfang database","important cause of acute respiratory tract infection","Chinese BioMedical Database","Respiratory syncytial virus","CBM","CNKI","PubMed","implementation of preventive measures","related morbidity","production of sputum","cough","selection of appropriate therapies","common clinical manifestations","development","high priority","BACKGROUND","systematic search","mortality","total","CONCLUSION","winter","young children","years","METHOD","findings","fever","RESULTS","spring","disease burden","inpatients","analysis","outpatients"],"language":"en"},

A novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family has been identified as the cause of this pulmonary disease. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the development of fast and sensitive diagnostic assays. Results A real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome. To evaluate this quantitative RT-PCR, cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by real-time RT-PCR. The assay allowed quantitation over a range of 102 to 108 RNA copies per reaction. Conclusions Extrapolated to clinical samples, this novel assay has a detection range of 104 to 1010 copies of viral genome equivalents per millilitre. In comparison to the current de facto cRNA Artus Biotech standard, the in-house cRNA standard gives a 100-fold higher absolute quantity, suggesting a possible underestimation of the viral load when using the Artus Biotech standard.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Maes, Piet; Duson, Griet; Neyts, Johan; Van Ranst, Marc","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9772fc1c327167f97f5bd7dc1bca59669acac351.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110610.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971205000603; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971205000603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["China","Republic"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","real-time RT-PCR","SARS-coronavirus","transcription of SARS","cRNA Artus Biotech standard","RNA copies","real-time quantitative RT-PCR","in-house cRNA standard","cRNA standards","novel assay","pulmonary disease","copies of viral genome equivalents","T7 RNA polymerase","emerging infectious disease","CoV Frankfurt","viral load","detection range","novel virus","rapid spread","development of fast","Summary Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome","possible underestimation","B domain","humans","replicase","nsp11 region","sensitive diagnostic assays","higher absolute quantity","clinical samples","millilitre","Coronaviridae family","People\u0027s Republic of China","cause","comparison","Conclusions","quantitation","reaction","severity"],"language":"en"},

A number of VZV genes remain functionally uncharacterized and since VZV is an obligate human pathogen, rigorous evaluation of VZV mutants in vivo remains challenging. Simian varicella virus (SVV) is homologous to VZV and SVV infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely mimics VZV infection of humans. Recently the SVV genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and BAC-derived SVV displayed similar replication kinetics as wild-type (WT) SVV in vitro. METHODS: RMs were infected with BAC-derived SVV or WT SVV at 4x10(5) PFU intrabronchially (N=8, 4 per group, sex and age matched). We collected whole blood (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at various days post-infection (dpi) and sensory ganglia during latent infection (\u003E84 dpi) at necropsy and compared disease progression, viral replication, immune response and the establishment of latency. RESULTS: Viral replication kinetics and magnitude in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and whole blood as well as rash severity and duration were similar in RMs infected with SVV BAC or WT SVV. Moreover, SVV-specific B and T cell responses were comparable between BAC and WT-infected animals. Lastly, we measured viral DNA in sensory ganglia from both cohorts of infected RMs during latent infection. CONCLUSIONS: SVV BAC is as pathogenic and immunogenic as WT SVV in vivo. Thus, the SVV BAC genetic system combined with the rhesus macaque animal model can further our understanding of viral ORFs important for VZV pathogenesis and the development of second-generation vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Christine; Dewane, Jesse; Haberthur, Kristen; Engelmann, Flora; Arnold, Nicole; Gray, Wayne; Messaoudi, Ilhem","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f0572cc1fa39ecc775cf576db694638a7fb9bc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3846606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24010815/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Varicella"],"organizations":["VZV","SVV","SVV BAC","BAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WT SVV","BAC-derived SVV","SVV genome","SVV BAC genetic system","SVV infection of rhesus macaques","SVV-specific B","VZV infection of humans","VZV pathogenesis","latent infection","WT-infected animals","Viral replication kinetics","number of VZV genes","cohorts of infected RMs","rigorous evaluation of VZV mutants","viral DNA","similar replication kinetics","results","sensory ganglia","various days post-infection","blood","Varicella zoster virus","understanding of viral ORFs important","bronchoalveolar lavage cells","Simian varicella virus","herpes zoster","rhesus macaque animal model","BAL","T cell responses","magnitude","immune response","obligate human pathogen","wild-type","disease progression","4x10","bacterial artificial chromosome","rash severity","neurotropic alphaherpesvirus","development of second-generation vaccines","duration","chickenpox","PBMC","BACKGROUND","establishment of latency","group","sex","necropsy","PFU","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Some of these viruses have been in the human population for centuries and others had recently emerged as a public health problem. Influenza viruses have been affecting the human population for a long time now; however, their ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic drift and antigenic shift causes the emergence of new strains. A recent example of these events is the avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus outbreak currently undergoing in China. Human H7N9 influenza viruses are resistant to amantadines and some strains are also resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors greatly limiting the options for treatment. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may cause a lower respiratory tract infection characterized by bronchiolitis and pneumonia mainly in children and the elderly. Infection with RSV can cause severe disease and even death, imposing a severe burden for pediatric and geriatric health systems worldwide. Treatment for RSV is mainly supportive since the only approved therapy, a monoclonal antibody, is recommended for prophylactic use in high-risk patients. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging respiratory virus. The virus was first recognized in 2012 and it is associated with a lower respiratory tract disease that is more severe in patients with comorbidities. No licensed vaccines or antivirals have been yet approved for the treatment of MERS-CoV in humans. It is clear that the discovery and development of novel antivirals that can be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to treat these important respiratory viral infections are critical. In this review, we will describe some of the novel therapeutics currently under development for the treatment of these infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Behzadi, Mohammad Amin; Leyva-Grado, Victor H.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40ac6a37f332f47ff9e9c6a6f8b1d5d21752679e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6594388.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275265/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01327","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["emerging respiratory virus","Respiratory syncytial virus","re-emergence of respiratory virus infections","case of influenza virus","important respiratory viral infections","lower respiratory tract disease","lower respiratory tract infection","Human H7N9 influenza viruses","RSV","treatment of MERS","severe disease","avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus outbreak","pandemic infections","human population","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe burden","MERS-CoV","global public health","public health problem","development of novel antivirals","emergence of new strains","geriatric health systems","antigenic shift","antigenic drift","high-risk patients","approved therapy","novel therapeutics","significant threat","bronchiolitis","amantadines","events","pneumonia","monoclonal antibody","prophylactic use","existing therapies","neuraminidase inhibitors","discovery","death","long time","children","ability","options","humans","China","recent example","elderly","combination","licensed vaccines","comorbidities","centuries","review"],"language":"en"},

The feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) on L. casei. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GFP antibody confirmed that GFP was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. The stability of recombinant L. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. These results indicate that the food-grade host/vector system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Jiayang; Wang, Xiuwen; Kong, Jian; Ma, Cuiqing; Xu, Ping","journal":"Microbiological Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46c611e413292dbf6f747a11b93de6f0a7ec1354.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126567.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944501314000160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944501314000160; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2014.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["casei ATCC","Lactobacillus casei","food-grade host","casei cells","food-grade cell surface display vector","food-grade cell surface display host","vector system","casei Q","new host","surface layer protein gene","Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC","recombinant cells","anti-GFP antibody","stability of recombinant","lactose metabolism genes","lactose-deficient derivative of","oral vaccine construction","oral vaccination applications","expression of green fluorescent protein","lactic acid bacteria","following","pSH71 replicon","Lactococcus lactis","immunofluorescence analysis","excellent antigen delivery vehicle","complementation markers","safe DNA elements","confocal microscopy","artificial gastrointestinal conditions","Laser","study","plasmid elimination","feasibility","Abstract","results"],"language":"en"},

A novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with SARS. The detection of the virus in these patients, its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia, and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model fulfilled Koch\u0027s postulates for implicating this coronavirus as the causal agent of SARS. The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the virus\u0027s identification. The rapid progress in the aetiology, the development of laboratory diagnostic tests, and the defining of routes of viral transmission were facilitated through a unique WHO-coordinated virtual network of laboratories, which shared information on a real-time basis through daily teleconferences. Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS coronavirus is of animal origin, that its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region, and that live-animal markets in southern China may have provided the animal-human interphase that allowed this precursor virus to adapt to human-human transmission. These findings underscore the potential for the re-emergence of SARS and the need for laboratory tests for early diagnosis. However, the low viral load in the respiratory tract makes early diagnosis of SARS a diagnostic challenge, although improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods continue to be made.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poon, LLM; Guan, Y; Nicholls, JM; Yuen, KY; Peiris, JSM","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58890a4a58ca42d0359c0bffb3e25997331bb8b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106534.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904011727; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904011727","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Koch"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Guangdong","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","re-emergence of SARS","early diagnosis of SARS","patients","animal populations","animal origin","animal markets","animal-human interphase","causal agent of SARS","human-human transmission","relevant animal model","diagnostic challenge","laboratory tests","development of laboratory diagnostic tests","precursor virus","viral transmission","novel coronavirus","respiratory tract","similar disease","sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods","southern China","new infectious disease","low viral load","Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome","improvements","need","healthy controls","information","aetiology","Koch\u0027s postulates","absence","defining of routes","atypical pneumonia","weeks","real-time basis","reproduction","region","daily teleconferences","Guangdong province","virtual network of laboratories","potential","rapid progress","Subsequent studies","genome sequence","virus\u0027s identification","findings","detection"],"language":"en"},

Mechanistic models that capture the dynamics of such \u201Cdependent happenings\u201D are a fundamental tool of infectious disease epidemiology. Recent methodological advances combined with access to new data sources and computational power have resulted in an explosion in the use of dynamic models in the analysis of emerging and established infectious diseases. Increasing use of models to inform practical public health decision making has challenged the field to develop new methods to exploit available data and appropriately characterize the uncertainty in the results. Here, we discuss recent advances and areas of active research in the mechanistic and dynamic modeling of infectious disease. We highlight how a growing emphasis on data and inference, novel forecasting methods, and increasing access to \u201Cbig data\u201D are changing the field of infectious disease dynamics. We showcase the application of these methods in phylodynamic research, which combines mechanistic models with rich sources of molecular data to tie genetic data to population-level disease dynamics.

It is critical to examine the drivers of MBR applications in China, which can provide sound scientific basis for future development of MBR applications. This study summarized the historical development of MBR applications and analyzed the driving forces by survey, literature review and interviews with MBR suppliers. The results showed that: (1) technical advantages of MBR and public policy related to water resources and environment promoted MBR beyond lab and pilot test into wide commercial applications in China; (2) petrochemical industry needs for wastewater treatment and reuse promoted medium-scale MBRs as public policy and regulation on water resources and environment tightens; (3) when the breakthrough of capacity of a single project above 10 thousand m3/d, the Green Olympic Games and Asian Games and tightening effluent regulations in environmentally sensitive areas incentivized MBR applications; and (4) the emergence of 100,000 m3/d MBR was mainly stimulated by water resources stress. Water resources stress and public policy related on resources and the environment are the primary driving forces in the last several decades. The future drivers of MBR applications in China appear to be decreasing operation cost.","publish_time":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ping; Liu, Li; Wu, Jiaojiao; Cheng, Rong; Shi, Lei; Zheng, Xiang; Zhang, Zhenxing","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bb0d4af7d7890d86aea152839bf534a931bc4bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112108.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30092518/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969718329115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718329115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["MBR suppliers","future development of MBR applications","future drivers of MBR applications","historical development of MBR applications","China","sensitive areas incentivized MBR applications","technical advantages of MBR","m3","water resources stress","public policy","environment","wide commercial applications","pilot test","decades","primary driving forces","Asian Games","breakthrough of capacity","Green Olympic Games","effluent regulations","literature review","lab","medium-scale MBRs","reuse","wastewater treatment","sound scientific basis","survey","interviews","petrochemical industry","single project","study","emergence","operation cost","Abstract","results"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to compare three digital RIDTs and one conventional RIDT. METHODS: We assessed 218 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients between neonates and 90 years old in 2016. Three digital RIDTs were BUDDI, Sofia Influenza A\u002BB Fluorescence Immunoassay, Veritor System Flu A\u002BB assay. One conventional test was the SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/2009). All test results were compared with those from the Anyplex Flu A/B Typing Real\u2010time Detection real\u2010time PCR. The four RIDTs were tested with diluted solutions from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) to compare lower detection limit. Cross\u2010reactivity of four RIDTs within other respiratory viruses was identified. RESULTS: For influenza A, BUDDI, Sofia, Veritor, and Bioline showed 87.7%, 94.5%, 87.7%, and 72.6% sensitivity, and 100%, 97.7%, 96.5%, and 100% specificity. For influenza B, BUDDI, Sofia, Veritor, and Bioline showed 81.7%, 91.7%, 81.7%, and 78.3% sensitivity, and 100%, 95.3%, 100%, and 100% specificity, respectively. Each RIDT could detect diluted NIBSC solution, according to the level of dilution and specific influenza subtypes. Cross\u2010reactivity of four RIDTs with other respiratory viruses was not noted. CONCLUSIONS: Sofia showed the highest sensitivity for influenza A and B detection. BUDDI and Veritor showed higher detection sensitivity than a conventional RIDT for influenza A detection, but similar results for influenza B detection.

In 1998, Congress requested that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluate priority-setting criteria for NIH funding; the IOM recommended greater consideration of disease burden. We examined whether the association between current burden and funding has changed since that time. METHODS: We analyzed public data on 2006 NIH funding for 29 common conditions. Measures of US disease burden in 2004 were obtained from the World Health Organization\u0027s Global Burden of Disease study and national databases. We assessed the relationship between disease burden and NIH funding dollars in univariate and multivariable log-linear models that evaluated all measures of disease burden. Sensitivity analyses examined associations with future US burden, current and future measures of world disease burden, and a newly standardized NIH accounting method. RESULTS: In univariate and multivariable analyses, disease-specific NIH funding levels increased with burden of disease measured in DALYs (p = 0.001), which accounted for 33% of funding level variation. No other factor predicted funding in multivariable models. Conditions receiving the most funding greater than expected based on disease burden were AIDS ($2474 M), diabetes mellitus ($390 M), and perinatal conditions ($297 M). Depression ($719 M), injuries ($691 M), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ($613 M) were the most underfunded. Results were similar using estimates of future US burden, current and future world disease burden, and alternate NIH accounting methods. CONCLUSIONS: Current levels of NIH disease-specific research funding correlate modestly with US disease burden, and correlation has not improved in the last decade.","publish_time":"2011-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gillum, Leslie A.; Gouveia, Christopher; Dorsey, E.

Amino acid differences in the surface protein, spike (S), in particular the S1 subunit, are associated with poor cross-protection. Here, homologous vaccination trials with recombinant IBVs (rIBVs), based on the apathogenic strain, BeauR, were conducted to elucidate the role of S1 in protection. A single vaccination of specific-pathogen-free chickens with rIBV expressing S1 of virulent strains M41 or QX, BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1), gave incomplete protection against homologous challenge, based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. There could be conformational issues with the spike if heterologous S1 and S2 are linked, suggesting a homologous S2 might be essential. To address this, a homologous vaccination-challenge trial incorporating rIBVs expressing full spike from M41, BeauR-M41(S), and S2 subunit from M41, BeauR-M41(S2) was conducted. All chimeric viruses grew to similar titers in vitro, induced virus-specific partial protective immunity, evident by cellular infiltrations, reductions in viral RNA load in the trachea and conjunctiva and higher serum anti-IBV titers. Collectively, these findings show that vaccination with rIBVs primed the birds for challenge but the viruses were cleared rapidly from the mucosal tissues in the head. Chimeric S1 and S2 viruses did not protect as effectively as BeauR-M41(S) based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. Booster vaccinations and an rIBV with improved in vivo replication may improve the levels of protection. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease, responsible for significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Amino acid differences in the surface protein, spike (S), in particular the S1 subunit, have been associated with poor cross-protection. Available vaccines give poor cross-protection and rationally designed live attenuated vaccines, based on apathogenic BeauR, could address these. Here, to determine the role of S1 in protection, a series of homologous vaccination trials with rIBVs were conducted. Single vaccinations with chimeric rIBVs induced virus-specific partial protective immunity, characterized by reduction in viral load and serum antibody titers. However, BeauR-M41(S) was the only vaccination to improve the level of protection against clinical signs and the loss of tracheal ciliary activity. Growth characteristics show that all of the rIBVs replicated in vitro to similar levels. Booster vaccinations and an rIBV with improved in vivo replication may improve the levels of protection.","publish_time":"2018-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ellis, Samantha; Keep, Sarah; Britton, Paul; de Wit, Sjaak; Bickerton, Erica; Vervelde, Lonneke","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f435af9f4c369a6738a5c079f5f9b486cf9e63e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6232476.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01473-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BeauR-M41","levels of protection","Chimeric S1","S1 subunit","incomplete protection","level of protection","poor cross-protection","broader protection","role of S1","heterologous S1","BeauR-QX","homologous S2","apathogenic BeauR","S1 of virulent strains M41","single vaccination of specific","spike","homologous challenge","homologous vaccination-challenge trial","Vaccination regimes","S2 subunit","S2 viruses","series of homologous vaccination trials","chimeric rIBVs induced virus-specific partial protective immunity","single virus serotype","clinical signs","Single vaccinations","insufficient levels of cross","chimeric viruses","similar levels","IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus","similar titers","Booster vaccinations","surface protein","viral load","serum antibody titers","loss of tracheal ciliary activity","Amino acid differences","replication","Available vaccines","attenuated vaccines","diverse vaccines","higher serum anti-IBV titers","viral RNA load","apathogenic strain","cellular infiltrations","conjunctiva","significant economic losses","contagious respiratory disease","reductions","pathogen-free chickens","recombinant IBVs","poultry industry","attempt","serotypes","birds","conformational issues","mucosal tissues","head","findings","Growth characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, using Tobit specifications it is seen that while demand intensity matters less in determining airlines inter-temporal inefficiency, their influence is stronger in determining peer group inefficiency. Block time, a representative of operational factors, tends to negatively impact airlines efficiency by imposing burdens on airline operations. Among the structural cost and revenue factors, fuel cost tends to affect inter-temporal inefficiency more robustly than it does to peer group efficiency. Labor pay tends to reduce inefficiency in case of inter-temporal while increasing peer group inefficiency. The events of September 11th had little or no impact on inter-temporal inefficiency but tended to reduce peer group inefficiency in a significant way.

However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Lijun; Ma, Simeng; Chen, Min; Yang, Jun; Wang, Ying; Li, Ruiting; Yao, Lihua; Bai, Hanping; Cai, Zhongxiang; Xiang Yang, Bing; Hu, Shaohua; Zhang, Kerang; Wang, Gaohua; Ma, Ci; Liu, Zhongchun","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d41627e2993d66b7f2d856e60f0ffd1337c079f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118532.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120303482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240764/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120303482","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mental health of medical","mental health interventions","mental health self-help","mental health of local medical","mental health status of medical","acute mental health disturbances","subthreshold mental health disturbances","nursing staff","mean PHQ","physical health perceptions","distressed staff","psychological care","psychological assistance","psychological needs","psychological materials","limited mental healthcare services","psychological resources available","Wuhan","levels of psychological distress","mild disturbances","moderate disturbances","important resources","severe disturbance","exposure","online push messages","factors","outbreak of novel coronavirus disease","infected people","times of widespread crisis","frontline workers","COVID","methods","efficacy","books","immediate wake","viral epidemic","Trends","lack","paper","noted burden","young women","quantitative study","importance","counseling","psychotherapy","epidemiological data","findings","participants","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

However, identifying the source of infection in many febrile infants is challenging because of insufficient presentation of signs and symptoms. Meningitis is a critical cause of fever in infants, and its diagnosis is confirmed invasively by lumbar puncture. This study aimed to evaluate potential laboratory markers for meningitis in febrile infants. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed infants aged \u003C3 months who visited the emergency department of our hospital between May 2012 and May 2017 because of fever of unknown etiology. Clinical information and laboratory data were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. RESULTS: In total, 145 febrile infants aged \u003C3 months who underwent lumbar punctures were evaluated retrospectively. The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly higher in the meningitis group than in the non-meningitis group, whereas the mean white blood cell count or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) did not significantly differ between groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CRP was 0.779 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.701\u20130.858). The AUC for the leukocyte count was 0.455 (95% CI, 0.360\u20130.550) and that for ANC was 0.453 (95% CI, 0.359\u20130.547). The CRP cut-off value of 10 mg/L was optimal for identifying possible meningitis. CONCLUSION: CRP has an intrinsic predictive value for meningitis in febrile infants aged \u003C3 months. Despite its invasiveness, a lumbar puncture may be recommended to diagnose meningitis in young, febrile infants with a CRP level \u003E10 mg/L.","publish_time":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Tae Gyoung; Yu, Seung Taek; So, Cheol Hwan","journal":"Yeungnam Univ J Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e8cbb254d84091bc1737f77d0076709d83de9ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7142029.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31914719/; https://doi.org/10.12701/yujm.2019.00402","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRP","ANC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["febrile infants","possible meningitis","CRP level","non-meningitis group","months","CRP cut-off value","leukocyte count","critical cause of fever","emergency department","AUC","ANC","lumbar punctures","absolute neutrophil count","mean white blood cell count","fever of unknown etiology","laboratory data","ROC curve","intrinsic predictive value","potential laboratory markers","mean C-reactive protein","common cause of pediatric consultation","insufficient presentation of signs","diagnosis","symptoms","Receiver","characteristic","curves","Clinical information","study","area","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","total","source of infection","confidence interval","hospital","RESULTS","invasiveness","METHODS","groups"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we report the cloning, expression, and biological activity of interferon \u03B2 (IFN\u03B2) from the Chinese microbat species, Myotis davidii. We demonstrated the upregulation of IFNB and IFN-stimulated genes in a kidney cell line derived from M. davidii after treatment with polyI:C or infection with Sendai virus.

M1s often have spatiotemporal expression patterns which allow for strict regulation of activity. Mutations in the genes encoding M1s result in disease and are often lethal. This family of zinc metallopeptidases all share the catalytic region containing a signature amino acid exopeptidase (GXMXN) and a zinc binding (HEXXH[18X]E) motif. In addition, M1 aminopeptidases often also contain additional membrane association and/or protein interaction motifs. These protein interaction domains may function independently of M1 enzymatic activity and can contribute to multifunctionality of the proteins. SCOPE: A brief review of M1 metalloproteases in plants and animals and their roles in the cell cycle is presented. In animals, human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) acts during mitosis and perhaps meiosis, while the insect homologue puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PAM-1) is required for meiotic and mitotic exit; the remaining human M1 family members appear to play a direct or indirect role in mitosis/cell proliferation. In plants, meiotic prophase aminopeptidase 1 (MPA1) is essential for the first steps in meiosis, and aminopeptidase M1 (APM1) appears to be important in mitosis and cell division. CONCLUSIONS: M1 metalloprotease activity in the cell cycle is conserved across phyla. The activities of the multifunctional M1s, processing small peptides and peptide hormones and contributing to protein trafficking and signal transduction processes, either directly or indirectly impact on the cell cycle. Identification of peptide substrates and interacting protein partners is required to understand M1 function in fertility and normal growth and development in plants.","publish_time":"2011-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peer, Wendy Ann","journal":"Annals of Botany","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be1330123d2c69063c2e6e1ae46176b2d9607308.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3091800.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-pdf/107/7/1171/17002144/mcq265.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21258033/; https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq265","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aminopeptidase M1","M1 function","cell cycle","M1 aminopeptidases","M1 metalloprotease activity","M1 enzymatic activity","cell proliferation","cell division","remaining human M1 family members","mitosis","plants","brief review of M1 metalloproteases","human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase","protein trafficking","protein partners","meiotic prophase aminopeptidase","protein interaction domains","protein interaction motifs","family of zinc metallopeptidases","insect homologue puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase","normal growth","meiosis","M1s result","animals","multifunctional M1s","development","phyla","strict regulation of activity","peptide hormones","zinc binding","Identification of peptide substrates","catalytic region","signature amino acid exopeptidase","GXMXN","PSA","additional membrane association","mitotic exit","small peptides","indirect role","acts","fertility","spatiotemporal expression patterns","HEXXH","disease","genes","signal transduction processes","MPA1","PAM","steps","APM1","roles","multifunctionality","Mutations","SCOPE","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","activities","viruses","proteins"],"language":"en"},

A number of 50 dams and their healthy newborns were included in the study.

The health condition of the newborns was daily monitored, and fecal samples were collected at first diarrheic episode of a calf. In all dams, the anti-C. parvum IgG antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 570 and 4070 mg/dl; in dams who gave birth to calves with diarrhea and were C. parvum-positive, the antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 680 and 3680 mg/dl (Table 1). The point-biserial correlation showed a negative correlation between the levels of anti-C. parvum antibodies and manifestation of clinical cryptosporidiosis (r=-0.425).

Surface element integration technique was adopted to calculate Derjaguin\u2013Landau\u2013Verwey\u2013Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies for the homoaggregates and heteroaggregates at different ionic strengths. Results show that attached homoaggregates on the planar surface at primary minima are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength whether the primary spheres of the homoaggregates are nano- or micro-sized. Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles with a microparticle can cause DLVO interaction energy to decrease monotonically with separation distance at low ionic strengths (e.g., \u2A7D0.01M), indicating that the heteroaggregates experience repulsive forces at all separation distances. Therefore, attachment of the heteroaggregates at primary minima can be detached upon reduction in ionic strength. Additionally, we showed that the adhesive forces and torques that the aforementioned heteroaggregates experience can be significantly smaller than those experienced by the microspheres without attaching nanoparticles, thus, the heteroaggregates are readily detached via hydrodynamic drag. Results of study provide plausible explanation for the observations in the literature that attached/aggregated particles can be detached/redispersed from primary minima upon reduction in ionic strength, which challenges the common belief that attachment/aggregation of particles in primary minima is chemically irreversible.","publish_time":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Chongyang; Wu, Lei; Zhang, Shiwen; Ye, Huichun; Li, Baoguo; Huang, Yuanfang","journal":"Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30531e307ccb3617d37b10f8437277896bfed407.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594038/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979714000563; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.01.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021979714000563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary minima","primary spheres","attached homoaggregates","solution ionic strength","aforementioned heteroaggregates experience","reduction","heteroaggregates experience repulsive forces","low ionic strengths","different ionic strengths","investigated detachment of homoaggregates","attachment","Results of study","Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles","DLVO interaction energy","planar surfaces","separation distances","interaction energies","solution chemistry","aggregation of particles","aggregated particles","adhesive forces","small colloidal clusters","Surface element integration technique","Overbeek","transients","Derjaguin","Verwey","well-defined structures","common belief","plausible explanation","literature","observations","Landau","Monte Carlo method","microspheres","hydrodynamic drag","microparticles"],"language":"en"},

In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret). Infection of hamsters with a ~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID(99)) of HTNV by the intramuscular and ~1 ID(99) of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney. In contrast, infection of hamsters with ~2 ID(99) of PUUV by the intramuscular or ~1 ID(99) of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome. Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected. In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production. Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets.

METHODS: In this study, the anti-influenza virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of PA against IAV in vitro were evaluated by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay. The neuraminidase inhibition assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and western blot assay were used to explore the anti-viral mechanisms. The anti-IAV activities in vivo were determined by mice pneumonia model and HE staining. RESULTS: The results showed that PA significantly inhibited different IAV strains multiplication in vitro, and may block IAV infection through inactivating virus particles directly and interfering with some early stages after virus adsorption. Cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA.

Different scoring functions focus on diverse aspects of ligand binding, and no single scoring can satisfy the peculiarities of each target system. Therefore, the idea of a consensus score strategy was put forward. Integrating several scoring functions, consensus score re-assesses the docked conformations using a primary scoring function. However, it is not really robust and efficient from the perspective of optimization. Furthermore, to date, the majority of available methods are still based on single objective optimization design. RESULTS: In this paper, two multi-objective optimization methods, called MOSFOM, were developed for virtual screening, which simultaneously consider both the energy score and the contact score. Results suggest that MOSFOM can effectively enhance enrichment and performance compared with a single score. For three different kinds of binding sites, MOSFOM displays an excellent ability to differentiate active compounds through energy and shape complementarity. EFMOGA performed particularly well in the top 2% of database for all three cases, whereas MOEA_Nrg and MOEA_Cnt performed better than the corresponding individual scoring functions if the appropriate type of binding site was selected. CONCLUSION: The multi-objective optimization method was successfully applied in virtual screening with two different scoring functions that can yield reasonable binding poses and can furthermore, be ranked with the potentially compromised conformations of each compound, abandoning those conformations that can not satisfy overall objective functions.","publish_time":"2009-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Honglin; Zhang, Hailei; Zheng, Mingyue; Luo, Jie; Kang, Ling; Liu, Xiaofeng; Wang, Xicheng; Jiang, Hualiang","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c78151fa23bf78cc20b2e2c5c0b47d79d12a1a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2753843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19210777/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-58","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Different scoring functions","single scoring","single score","corresponding individual scoring functions","energy score","accurate scoring function","primary scoring function","overall objective functions","MOSFOM","virtual screening","multi-objective optimization methods","single objective optimization design","contact score","consensus score strategy","reasonable binding","perspective of optimization","different kinds of binding sites","docked conformations","MOEA","compromised conformations","RESULTS","diverse aspects of ligand binding","appropriate type of binding site","majority of available methods","hot issue","active compounds","excellent ability","current computer-aided drug research","Cnt","paper","shape complementarity","Nrg","Development","peculiarities","CONCLUSION","performance","cases","date","idea","enrichment","target system","BACKGROUND","database","EFMOGA"],"language":"en"},

The first survey involved 4\u201312-day-old calves in six dairy-calf distribution centres, collecting calves from seven Administrative Regions (Aquitaine, Bretagne, Franche-Comt\u00E9, Lorraine, Normandie, Nord, Pays de Loire). For each region, 20 calves were selected every month for 12 consecutive months (October 1995\u2013September 1996). Prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was 17.9% (Confidence Intervals (C.I.) 95%=[16.1%; 19.8%]) among the 1628 selected calves, of which only 5.3% had diarrhoea. The second survey conducted between November 1995 and May 1996 involved 4\u201321-day-old calves examined by veterinary practitioners who selected 189 livestock farms of dairy- or suckler-type in ten Administrative Departments (Allier, Cantal, Creuse, Doubs, Ille-et-Vilaine, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Pas-de-Calais, Sa\u00F4ne-et-Loire, Vend\u00E9e). Cryptosporidia were detected in 105 (55.6%) of the farms. Among the 440 calves examined, of which 398 (90.5%) presented diarrhoea, cryptosporidia were found in 191 animals, i.e. a prevalence of 43.4% (C.I. 95%=[38.8%; 48.0%]). Breed of calves and type of housing had very little impact on prevalence in this survey. Some regional variations could be noticed, even if cryptosporidia infection is widespread. Monthly variations could be related to seasonal peaks in calving with a lower infection rate during summer.","publish_time":"2000-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lefay, Didier; Naciri, Muriel; Poirier, Pierre; Chermette, Ren\u00E9","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/263a5a39738f28e5b5f3b96a4384634bce67f351.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126214.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401799002307; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401799002307","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lorraine"],"organizations":["ten Administrative Departments"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["selected calves","day-old calves","Breed of calves","prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection","cryptosporidia infection","Loire","detection of Cryptosporidium","lower infection rate","diarrhoea","livestock farms of dairy","Sa\u00F4ne-et","Maine-et","Administrative Departments","suckler-type","type of housing","Administrative Regions","Monthly variations","regional variations","dairy-calf distribution centres","Franche-Comt\u00E9","Creuse","Bretagne","Cantal","Doubs","Allier","Ille-et-Vilaine","Pas-de-Calais","Manche","Aquitaine","qualitative ELISA","Lorraine","Normandie","seasonal peaks","calving","little impact","veterinary practitioners","Nord","France","multicentre surveys","summer","Vend\u00E9e","Confidence Intervals","consecutive months","oocysts","animals"],"language":"en"},

Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. METHODS: This was a mixed-method research study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) during October 2014 to September 2016. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and 7 key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. FINDINGS: The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (73.1%) but poor timeliness (40.2%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports during the study period. Major implementation gaps were lack of weekly report and trainings. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included case identification, compiling reports for timely submission and inadequate resources. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection.","publish_time":"2018-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joseph Wu, Tsung-Shu; Kagoli, Matthew; Kaasb\u00F8ll, Jens Johan; Bjune, Gunnar Aksel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68b617740b5abe48673b58026457150cf7fc5985.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6264833.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496177/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200858","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health Regulation","national District Health Information System","IDSR"],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["IDSR system implementation","national surveillance system","public health surveillance system","current IDSR system","timeliness of surveillance system performance","future disease surveillance system","national District Health Information System","challenges of IDSR implementation","state of IDSR implementation","IDSR technical guideline","Integrated Disease Surveillance","weekly reports","Qualitative data","emerging mobile health","International Health Regulation","selected district","compiling reports","frontline health service providers","Malawi","differences","Major implementation gaps","outbreaks","better timeliness","national levels","poor timeliness","Quantitative data","study period","Ebola Virus Disease","actual practice","developing information technology infrastructure","total expected monthly reports","good completeness","early response","mixed-method research study","lack of weekly report","case identification","timely submission","resource-constrained countries","EVD","mHealth","interviews","key informants","administration","strategy","global efforts","inadequate resources","bell","unusual events detection","IHR","requirements","DHIS2","OBJECTIVE","opportunities","trainings","country","CONCLUSIONS","FINDINGS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. Objective To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed. Results A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]). A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P \u003C .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%]; P \u003C .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13 800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/\u03BCL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] \u03BCg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs \u003C0.006 [\u003C0.006-0.009] \u03BCg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P \u003C .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P \u003C .001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P \u003C .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P \u003C .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P = .02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P \u003C .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).

Two experiments of 6 pigs each were conducted. Pigs were farrowed in isolation, weaned at 7 days of age, and housed in individual HEPA filtered isolation chambers. In each experiment, 3 pigs served as controls and 3 were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV (ATCC VR-2402) at 3 weeks of age. In a first experiment, on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post inoculation (PI), pigs were anesthetized and intubated. The following samples were collected: serum, saliva, conjunctival swabs, urine by cystocentesis, and feces. Upon recovery from anesthesia, the endotracheal tube was removed, rinsed, and the rinse retained. In the second experiment, the sampling schedule was expanded and serum, saliva, and oropharyngeal samples were collected from day 55 to day 124 PI at 14 day intervals. Virus was isolated in porcine alveolar macrophages up to day 14 from urine, day 21 from serum, day 35 from endotracheal tube rinse, day 42 from saliva, and day 84 from oropharyngeal samples. No virus was recovered from conjunctival swabs, fecal samples, or negative control samples. This is the first report of isolation of PRRSV from saliva. Virus-contaminated saliva, especially when considered in the context of social dominance behavior among pigs, may play an important role in PRRSV transmission. These results support previous reports of persistent infection with PRRSV prolonged recovery of virus from tonsils of swine.","publish_time":"1997-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wills, Robert W.; Zimmerman, Jeff J.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Swenson, Sabrina L.; Hoffman, Lorraine J.; McGinley, Michael J.; Hill, Howard T.; Platt, Kenneth B.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113597000795; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113597000795","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pigs","day intervals","Virus-contaminated saliva","oropharyngeal samples","PRRSV prolonged recovery of virus","serum","fecal samples","PRRSV transmission","following samples","respiratory syndrome virus","negative control samples","conjunctival swabs","urine","endotracheal tube rinse","isolation chambers","report of isolation","days of age","weeks of age","porcine alveolar macrophages","duration of shedding","previous reports of persistent infection","potential sites of exit","results","context of social dominance behavior","individual HEPA","cystocentesis","important role","tonsils of swine","sampling schedule","anesthesia","post inoculation","ATCC VR","study","feces","controls","experiments"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the antibody-in-lymphocyte supernatant (ALS) assay to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) G secretion from ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture, as a potential diagnostic test for pneumococcal pneumonia. We enrolled 348 children with pneumonia admitted to Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal between December 2015 and September 2016. PBMCs sampled from participants were incubated for 48 h before harvesting of cell culture supernatant (ALS). We used a fluorescence-based multiplexed immunoassay to measure the concentration of IgG in ALS against five conserved pneumococcal protein antigens. Of children with pneumonia, 68 had a confirmed etiological diagnosis: 12 children had pneumococcal pneumonia (defined as blood or pleural fluid culture-confirmed; or plasma CRP concentration \u226560 mg/l and nasopharyngeal carriage of serotype 1 pneumococci), and 56 children had non-pneumococcal pneumonia. Children with non-pneumococcal pneumonia had either a bacterial pathogen isolated from blood (six children); or C-reactive protein \u003C60 mg/l, absence of radiographic consolidation and detection of a pathogenic virus by multiplex PCR (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, or parainfluenza viruses; 23 children). Concentrations of ALS IgG to all five pneumococcal proteins were significantly higher in children with pneumococcal pneumonia than in children with non-pneumococcal pneumonia. The concentration of IgG in ALS to the best-performing antigen discriminated between children with pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal pneumonia with a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% CI 0.73\u20131.0), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.52\u20130.78) and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) 0.85 (95% CI 0.75\u20130.94). Children with pneumococcal pneumonia were older than children with non-pneumococcal pneumonia (median 5.6 and 2.0 years, respectively, p \u003C 0.001). When the analysis was limited to children \u22652 years of age, assay of IgG ALS to pneumococcal proteins was unable to discriminate between children with pneumococcal pneumonia and non-pneumococcal pneumonia (AUROCC 0.67, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.88).

However, their sensitivity and specificity are a matter of debate, challenging their clinical usefulness. OBJECTIVES: Comparing diagnostic performances of BinaxNow Influenza AB(\u00AE) (BNI) and BinaxNow RSV(\u00AE) (BNR), to those of real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), virus isolation and direct immunofluorescence (D-IF) in paediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: Between November 2005 and September 2013, 521 nasal washings from symptomatic children (age \u003C5 years) attending our tertiary care centre were tested, with a combination of the respective assays using RT-PCR as gold standard. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of BNI were 69% (confidence interval [CI] [51\u201383]), 96% [94\u201397], 55% [39\u201370] and 98% [96\u201399] respectively. Of eleven false-negative samples, RT-PCR Ct-values were higher than all RT-PCR positive test results (27 vs 22, p = 0.012). Of twenty false-positive samples, none were culture positive and two tested positive in D-IF. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for BNR were 79% [73\u201385], 98% [96\u201399], 97% [93\u201399] and 88% [84\u201391]. Of the 42 false-negative samples the median Ct-value was higher than that of all RT-PCR positive samples (31 vs 23, p \u003C 0.0001). Five false-positive samples were detected. Three of these tested positive for RSV in virus isolation and D-IF. CONCLUSIONS: RADTs have a high specificity with BNR being superior to BNI. However, their relative low sensitivity limits their usefulness for clinical decision making in a tertiary care paediatric hospital.","publish_time":"2016-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moesker, F.M.; van Kampen, J.J.A.; Aron, G.; Schutten, M.; van de Vijver, D.A.M.C.; Koopmans, M.P.G.; Osterhaus, A.D.M.E.; Fraaij, P.L.A.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41efa82d4f31747f0cd0a3be277b7840dca1a73f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185377.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653216300506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653216300506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045454/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.03.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BNI","BNR","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR positive samples","false-positive samples","culture positive","RT-PCR positive test results","positive predictive value","false-negative samples","RT-PCR Ct-values","BNI","BNR","negative predictive value","virus isolation","high specificity","BinaxNow RSV","real-time reverse transcriptase PCR","median Ct-value","PPV","vs","RADTs","clinical usefulness","NPV","relative low sensitivity","tertiary care paediatric hospital","respiratory syncytial virus","tertiary care centre","clinical decision","influenza viruses","paediatric patients","diagnostic performances of BinaxNow Influenza AB","years","symptomatic children","age","Rapid antigen detection tests","respective assays","direct immunofluorescence","nasal washings","BACKGROUND","combination","matter of debate","gold standard","OBJECTIVES","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS","STUDY DESIGN"],"language":"en"},

Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively.

Among them, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) are known to be activated by various environmental stresses including virus infections. Previously, activation of the JNK pathway has been detected in cells infected with several coronaviruses. However, detailed characterization of the pathway as well as its implication in host\u2013virus interactions has not been fully investigated. Here we report that the JNK pathway was activated in cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Of the two known upstream MAPK kinases (MKK), MKK7, but not MKK4, was shown to be responsible for IBV-induced JNK activation. Moreover, knockdown and overexpression experiments demonstrated that JNK served as a pro-apoptotic protein during IBV infection. Interestingly, pro-apoptotic activity of JNK was not mediated via c-Jun, but involved modulation of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2). Taken together, JNK constitutes an important aspect of coronavirus\u2013host interaction, along with other MAPKs.","publish_time":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fung, To Sing; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c67252392670f7eb8bd7ec3c01daf8e2b3a6da9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5870581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238080/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-017-0053-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JNK","MAPK","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JNK pathway","pro-apoptotic activity of JNK","IBV-induced JNK activation","conserved protein kinases","pro-apoptotic protein","Mitogen-activated protein kinases","N-terminal kinases","MAPKs","IBV infection","known upstream MAPK kinases","virus infections","cells","virus interactions","anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma","important aspect of coronavirus","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","host interaction","variety of important cellular","modulation","various environmental stresses","MKK7","implication","Bcl2","pathways","overexpression experiments","MKK4","detailed characterization","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.

Recent advances in the development of isoenzyme-selective PLD inhibitors and in molecular genetics have suggested that PLD isoenzymes in mammalian cells and pathogenic organisms may be valuable targets for the treatment of several human diseases. Isoenzyme-selective inhibitors have revealed complex inter-relationships between PtdOH biosynthetic pathways and the role of PtdOH in pathophysiology.

A large part of their success can be attributed to the induction of central immunotolerance including B- and T-cells upon fetal infection leading to the generation of persistently infected (PI) animals. In the past few years, it became evident that evasion of innate immunity is a central element to induce and maintain persistent infection. Hence, the viral non-structural protease N(pro) heads the transcription factor IRF-3 for proteasomal degradation, whereas an extracellularly secreted, soluble form of the envelope glycoprotein E(rns) degrades immunostimulatory viral single- and double-stranded RNA, which makes this RNase unique among viral endoribonucleases. We propose that these pestiviral interferon (IFN) antagonists maintain a state of innate immunotolerance mainly pertaining its viral nucleic acids, in contrast to the well-established immunotolerance of the adaptive immune system, which is mainly targeted at proteins. In particular, the unique extension of \u2018self\u2019 to include the viral genome by degrading immunostimulatory viral RNA by E(rns) is reminiscent of various host nucleases that are important to prevent inappropriate IFN activation by the host\u2019s own nucleic acids in autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Gouti\u00E8res syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. This mechanism of \u201Cinnate tolerance\u201D might thus provide a new facet to the role of extracellular RNases in the sustained prevention of the body\u2019s own immunostimulatory RNA to act as a danger-associated molecular pattern that is relevant across various species.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lussi, Carmela; Schweizer, Matthias","journal":"Cytokine Growth Factor Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5abde4f8272e54a46e3eeb1554fde8e97a80c25b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173139.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021825/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2016.03.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610116300296; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610116300296","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunostimulatory viral RNA","viral genome","viral endoribonucleases","immunostimulatory viral single","viral nucleic acids","bovine viral diarrhea virus","immunostimulatory RNA","viral non-structural protease N","state of innate immunotolerance","rns","well-established immunotolerance","induction of central immunotolerance","innate tolerance","border disease virus","double-stranded RNA","evasion of innate immunity","classical swine fever virus","central element","various species","RNase unique","fetal infection","unique extension","persistent infection","envelope glycoprotein E","inappropriate IFN activation","important pathogens of livestock","reminiscent of various host nucleases","host\u2019s","BDV","BVDV","Aicardi-Gouti\u00E8res syndrome","autoimmune diseases","sustained prevention","antagonists","role of extracellular RNases","transcription factor IRF","soluble form","T-cells","contrast","systemic lupus erythematosus","proteasomal degradation","molecular pattern","new facet","generation","adaptive immune system","CSFV","danger","body\u2019s","self","Pestiviruses","PI","years","pestiviral interferon","success","animals","past","mechanism","proteins"],"language":"en"},

In China, about 11,000 Muslim pilgrims participate in the Hajj gathering in Mecca annually. This is the first report of MERS-CoV and respiratory virus molecular screening of returning pilgrims at points of entry in China from 2013 to 2015. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 847 returning Hajj pilgrims participated in this study. The test results indicated that of the travelers, 34 tested positive for influenza A virus, 14 for influenza B virus, 4 for metapneumo virus, 2 for respiratory syncytial virus, and 3 for human coronavirus. There was a significant difference in the rates of positive and negative influenza virus tests between Hajj pilgrims with symptoms and those without. The detection rates of influenza virus were not significantly different among the three years studied, at 5.3, 6.0 and 6.3% for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases.

Recent years have seen an upsurge in studies investigating the role of lipids in \u002BRNA virus replication, in particular of sterols, and uncovered that membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins are hijacked by viruses and play pivotal roles in VRC formation.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strating, Jeroen RPM; van Kuppeveld, Frank JM","journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/414521e701ed2e14e8bd5fa7a59a79cbf8add79d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127510.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2017.02.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955067416301594; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0955067416301594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA virus replication","viral RNA genome replication","Disparate viruses","dengue virus","Positive-strand RNA","VRCs","VRC formation","so-called viral replication compartments","hepatitis C virus","role of lipids","particular of sterols","lipid metabolism","specific sets of lipids","membrane contact sites","lipid transfer proteins","remodel cellular membranes","SARS-coronavirus","poliovirus","host lipidome","glycerophospholipids","upsurge","studies","sphingolipids","pivotal roles","place","disparities","interactions","commonalities"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P \u003C 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT score were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively, for the discrimination of the 2 types. The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Kunhua; Wu, Jiong; Wu, Faqi; Guo, Dajing; Chen, Linli; Fang, Zheng; Li, Chuanming","journal":"Invest Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1478021af121e20bce3f1eeddc320d83a5410543.json; document_parses/pdf_json/66f43022b3fa0cafec3e462b6817beb098921c8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147273.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118615/; https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical patients","ordinary patients","critical COVID","CT scores of severe","critical cases","critical coronavirus disease","ordinary cases","pneumonia","CT manifestations","chest CT images","high CT scores","risk factors","disease severity","clinical factors of age older","specificity of CT score","chest pain","clinical symptoms","clinical data","higher incidence of comorbidities","linear opacities","crazy-paving pattern","expectoration","cough","bronchial wall thickening","incidences of consolidation","dyspnea","features","higher incidences of lymph node enlargement","Computed tomography findings of consolidation","older ages","pericardial effusion","pleural effusion","increased inflammation indicators","decreased lymphocytes","laboratory examinations","years","significant differences","extrapulmonary lesions","sensitivity","characteristic curve","study","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","aim","Receiver","CONCLUSIONS","MATERIALS","clinicians","RESULTS","discrimination","types","prognosis"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we sought to find a predicted tertiary structure for IBV S1 using I-TASSER, which is an automated homology modeling platform. We found that the predicted structures obtained were robust and consistent with experimental data. For instance, we observed that all four residues (38, 43, 63, and 68) that have been shown to be critical for binding to host tissues, were found at the surface of the predicted structure of Massachusetts (Mass) S1 spike. Together with antigenicity index analysis, we were also able to show that Ma5 vaccine has higher antigenicity indices at residues close to the receptor-binding region than M41 vaccine, thereby providing a possible mechanism on how Ma5 achieves better protection against challenge. Examination of the predicted structure of the Arkansas IBV S1 spike also gave insights on the effect of polymorphisms at position 43 on the surface availability of receptor binding residues.

A cell entry is the first step for infection. Our previous study indicated that there was an endocytosis pathway for hMPV cell entry. Lipid raft is a specific structure at the cell surface and it has been demonstrated to play an important role in endocytosis process of many viruses. In this study, we investigated whether and how lipid raft can take part in the hMPV entry. The confocal microscope was used to detect colocalization of hMPV and lipid raft marker. We demonstrated that colocalizations were increased along with the viral infection and hMPV particles transferred to the perinuclear region with lipid raft. When specific lipid raft inhibitors: methyl\u2010\u03B2 cyclodextrin and nystatin were used, hMPV cell entry was inhibited and viral titer decreased dramatically. With the replenishment of exogenous cholesterol, hMPV recovered quickly. These data suggest that lipid raft plays an important role in hMPV endocytosis and maybe one of the pathways for hMPV cell entry.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Suhua; He, Hao; Yang, Hui; Tan, Bin; Liu, Enmei; Zhao, Xiaodong; Zhao, Yao","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c3c6dbc277565be82c39b91f1d1327ea8adde66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166723.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hMPV entry","hMPV cell entry","hMPV endocytosis","colocalization of hMPV","hMPV particles","lipid raft marker","specific lipid raft inhibitors","cell surface","endocytosis process","endocytosis pathway","important role","viral infection","specific structure","viral titer","previous study","methyl","\u03B2 cyclodextrin","nystatin","perinuclear region","pathways","crucial pathogen","viruses","replenishment of exogenous cholesterol","step","Human metapneumovirus","children","confocal microscope","data","colocalizations"],"language":"en"},

The mRNAs corresponding to the genes encoding the peplomer (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of the variant viruses were found to be smaller in size. The possible sequence changes were studied by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and direct RNA sequencing. Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties. These findings suggest that the changes in pathogenic properties of the two neural isolates are associated with drastic alterations of the viral structural glycoproteins.","publish_time":"1991-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monica, Nicola La; Banner, Lisa R.; Morris, Vincent L.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12ebc361e7987296b4b0e2812b604ef189c37269.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190635O; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190635O","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wistar Furth"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein","truncated protein","amino acids","MHV variants","spinal cord","amino-terminal half","neurotropic variants","large deletion","infected cells","deletion site","parental virus","pathogenic properties","intracellular RNA","variant viruses","JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","carboxy-terminal end","different biological properties","possible sequence changes","direct RNA sequencing","infected Wistar Furth rat","drastic alterations","oligonucleotide","neural isolates","translational regulation","rapid degradation","brain","viral structural glycoproteins","hypervariable region","hemagglutinin-esterase","genes","peplomer","deletions","findings","size","mRNAs"],"language":"en"},

The reovirus outer capsid protein \u03BC1 is recognized as the primary determinant of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Here, we investigated the apoptosis induced by BYD1, its outer capsid protein \u03BC1, and its cell-attachment protein \u03C31 to understand the pathogenesis of BYD1. We also investigated BYD1 caused systemic complications in suckling mice. Under electron microscopy, BYD1-infected cells showed characteristics typical of apoptosis. Notably, ectopically expressed \u03BC1 and \u03C31 induced similar pathological apoptosis, independent of BYD1 infection, in host cells in which they were expressed, which suggests that \u03BC1 and \u03C31 are both apoptotic virulence factors. Consistent with previous reports of reovirus pathogenicity, suckling mice intracranially inoculated with BYD1 developed central nerve damage, myocarditis, and pneumonia. Collectively, our data suggest that BYD1 \u03BC1- and \u03C31-induced apoptosis is involved in the multi-organ lesions in a suckling mouse BYD1 infection model.","publish_time":"2014-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Lihua; Lu, Yongfeng; He, Jun; Yu, Yonghui; Zuo, Tingting; Li, Yanwei; Zhu, Hong; Duan, Qing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3db3a962e710f4712e14a5162a9e7f3f136696f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3963933.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664247/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BYD1 \u03BC1","pathogenesis of BYD1","\u03C31-induced apoptosis","BYD1-infected cells","independent of BYD1 infection","novel reovirus","virus-induced apoptosis","novel mammalian reassortant reovirus BYD1","reovirus outer capsid protein \u03BC1","suckling mouse BYD1 infection model","similar pathological apoptosis","primary determinant of reovirus","characteristics typical of apoptosis","suckling mice","previous reports of reovirus pathogenicity","cell-attachment protein \u03C31","host cells","cultured cells","SARS-coronavirus","SARS pandemic","multi-organ lesions","myocarditis","central nerve damage","characterization","electron microscopy","systemic complications","apoptotic virulence factors","accomplice role","pathogenic mechanism","pneumonia","isolation","data"],"language":"en"},

Children (aged \u226413) presenting with ARI between January 2012 and December 2013 tested for 15 RVs using the Seeplex(R) RV15 kit were retrospectively included. Epidemiological data was retrieved from patient records. Of the 2235 children tested, 61.5% were \u22641 year with a male: female ratio of 3:2. Viruses were detected in 1364 (61.02%) children, 233 (10.4%) having dual infections: these viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24%), human rhinovirus (hRV) (19.7%), adenovirus (5.7%), influenza virus (5.3%), and parainfluenzavirus\u20103 (4.6%). Children, aged 9\u201311 months, were most infected (60.9%). Lower respiratory tract infections (55.4%) were significantly more than upper respiratory tract infection (45.3%) (P \u003C 0.001). Seasonal variation of RV was directly and inversely proportional to relative humidity and temperature, respectively, for non MERS coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, and OC43).

We aimed to conduct a comprehensive etiologic and epidemiologic study of multiple CIRD agents in a diverse dog population using molecular methods and statistical modeling analyses. In addition, a novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate two species of Mycoplasma (M. canis and M. cynos). Canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, influenza A virus (H3N2 and H3N8), Bordetella bronchiseptica, M. canis, M. cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were investigated in specimens from clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs received at the Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Results showed low occurrence of classical CIRD agents such as B. bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus and distemper virus, while highlighting the potential role of emerging bacteria such as M. canis and M. cynos. Statistical modeling analyses of CIRD pathogens emphasized the impact of co-infections on the severity of clinical presentation, and showed that host factors, such as animal age, are the most important predictors of disease severity. This study provides new insights into the current understanding of the prevalence and role of co-infections with selected viruses and bacteria in the etiology of CIRD, while underscoring the importance of molecular diagnosis and vaccination against this disease.","publish_time":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maboni, Grazieli; Seguel, Mauricio; Lorton, Ana; Berghaus, Roy; Sanchez, Susan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb98e2840f97f1b0425ac66e90784b5fe5fcecb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6483346.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CIRD"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["canine distemper virus","etiology of CIRD","Canine adenovirus","canine parainfluenza virus","role of co-infections","Statistical modeling analyses of CIRD pathogens","canis","cynos","epidemiologic study of multiple CIRD agents","prevalence of pathogens","Canine infectious respiratory disease","impact of co-infections","low occurrence of classical CIRD agents","bacterial pathogens","syndrome","potential role of emerging bacteria","important predictors of disease severity","molecular methods","Bordetella bronchiseptica","importance of molecular diagnosis","severity of clinical presentation","diverse dog population","coronavirus","H3N2","selected viruses","asymptomatic dogs","current understanding","novel probe","specimens","H3N8","animal age","host factors","Streptococcus equi","Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory","multiplex real-time PCR","new insights","zooepidemicus","Results","vaccination","pathogenesis","United States","limited information","species of Mycoplasma","addition","illness"],"language":"en"},

The severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spread first in southern China in 2003 with about 8000 infected cases in few months. Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still on-going epidemic associated to a high fatality rate. CoVs are thus considered a major health threat. This is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either SARS- or MERS-CoV. Therefore, new drugs need to be identified in order to develop antiviral treatments limiting CoV replication. In this study, we focus on the nsp14 protein, which plays a key role in virus replication as it methylates the RNA cap structure at the N7 position of the guanine. We developed a high-throughput N7-MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF\u00AE) and screened chemical libraries (2000 compounds) on the SARS-CoV nsp14. 20 compounds inhibiting the SARS-CoV nsp14 were further evaluated by IC50 determination and their specificity was assessed toward flavivirus- and human cap N7-MTases. Our results reveal three classes of compounds: 1) molecules inhibiting several MTases as well as the dengue virus polymerase activity unspecifically, 2) pan MTases inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular MTases, and 3) inhibitors targeting one viral MTase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap N7-MTase. These compounds provide a first basis towards the development of more specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aouadi, Wahiba; Eydoux, C\u00E9cilia; Coutard, Bruno; Martin, Baptiste; Debart, Fran\u00E7oise; Vasseur, Jean Jacques; Contreras, Jean Marie; Morice, Christophe; Qu\u00E9rat, Gilles; Jung, Marie-Louise; Canard, Bruno; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Decroly, Etienne","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46546ca01fdd0a53128bbb11664339efb311754c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113892.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28676301/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217303911; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217303911; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.06.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence"],"locations":["China","Middle East","Arabian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV nsp14","CoV replication","MERS-CoV","human cap N7-MTases","viral MTase","pan MTases inhibitors","N7 position","cellular MTases","classes of compounds","specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases","high-throughput N7-MTase assay","severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus","severe respiratory syndromes","virus replication","nsp14 protein","Middle East respiratory syndrome","pathogenic human coronaviruses","RNA cap structure","dengue virus polymerase activity","high fatality rate","HTRF","on-going epidemic","Homogenous Time","Fluorescence","key role","screened chemical libraries","vaccine","order","Arabian Peninsula","beginning","antiviral treatments","development","flavivirus","IC50 determination","specificity","basis","molecules","major health threat","infected cases","southern China","months","CoVs","results","guanine","new drugs","century","study"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, all practical trainings at clinics and on ambulances had to be put on hold. As the apprentices\u2019 training objective was acutely endangered by the expected lengthy teaching downtimes, it was of crucial importance to successfully establish homeschooling. While members of our teaching staff were additionally bound by support for the Munich crisis unit, the switch to virtual classroom teaching for all ongoing courses significantly increased the overall workload of the staff. In a first step, we established a fast video and communication platform via Microsoft Skype. All other issues had to be solved on the fly due to the lack of preparation time. Soon it became obvious that using only classic upfront teaching methods was not an option due to the resulting monotony of a full-time 35 h training week. Additionally, we had to ensure that exams would also be possible during homeschooling to avoid the accumulation of missing performance assessments. Within a few days, it became clear that almost all forms of social interactions and teaching methods could be integrated into the virtual classroom with minor limitations. A survey among students showed that while homeschooling cannot fully replace classroom teaching, it is considered a good alternative in emergency situations. Furthermore, many trainees think that homeschooling could be a valuable addition to normal classroom teaching. Maybe this crisis could turn out to be the beginning of a new complementary teaching strategy.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frie\u00DF, C.; Bayerl, T.","journal":"Notf Rett Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d274b3d8344967ab5fd34f8ef62aead3adc9ea04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412532/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10049-020-00709-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Munich","Microsoft Skype"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["teaching staff","virtual classroom teaching","normal classroom teaching","homeschooling","classic upfront teaching methods","expected lengthy teaching downtimes","new complementary teaching strategy","Munich crisis unit","ongoing Coronavirus crisis","days","ongoing courses","emergency situations","h training week","apprentices\u2019 training objective","emergency paramedic vocational school","Berufsfachschule f\u00FCr Notfallsanit\u00E4ter","switch","fast video","communication platform","option","support","valuable addition","Microsoft Skype","forms of social interactions","resulting monotony","German schools","ambulances","department","overall workload","beginning","accumulation of missing performance assessments","good alternative","crucial importance","practical trainings","clinics","minor limitations","lack of preparation time","fly","step","survey","students","exams","members","hold","trainees","issues"],"language":"en"},

Methods Eight national daily newspapers from the UK were reviewed for 20 days over a 2-month period. All articles reporting newly emerging research pertaining to health in humans were included and reviewed independently by two raters. A descriptive analysis was performed. Subsequently, a quality assessment tool for use by a non-expert was developed and validated to objectively assess the quality of a newspaper article on a health-related topic. Results The quality assessment tool was found to have good internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. The Daily Mail published almost twice as many articles as its nearest rival, The Daily Express, and over eight times as many articles as The Guardian. Articles in The Times were, on average, more than twice as long as those in The Sun and The Daily Telegraph. The highest quality articles were in The Times and The Independent, with the lowest quality articles in The Sun. The quality scores of anonymous articles were significantly lower than those attributed to named journalists. Conclusions There are significant differences in the quality of reporting within and between major daily UK newspapers, with anonymous articles being the poorest quality, and widespread reliance on press releases from the major UK scientific journals.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robinson, A.; Coutinho, A.; Bryden, A.; McKee, M.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da8f869352823053da770935dc37fa959a87c276.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111686.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219265/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350612003484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2012.10.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350612003484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","Daily Express","Guardian","The Daily Telegraph"],"locations":["The Sun"],"keyphrases":["quality of reporting","lowest quality articles","highest quality articles","quality scores of anonymous articles","poorest quality","quality assessment tool","health-related articles","major daily UK newspapers","national daily newspapers","major British newspapers","Daily Express","times","Daily Mail","Daily Telegraph","major UK scientific journals","good piece of medical reporting","health-related topic","good internal consistency","press releases","widespread reliance","emerging research pertaining","use","newspaper article","inter-rater reliability","validation","humans","sources","significant differences","nearest rival","Study design Development","non-expert","days","Methods","month period","news threads","Conclusions","Guardian","Summary Objectives","descriptive analysis","journalists","average","raters"],"language":"en"},

Apoptosis is an effective means to sacrifice virus-infected host cells and therefore restrict the spread of pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) is critical for SeV (Sendai virus)-induced apoptosis. MAVS specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) but not other MAP kinases. Jnk2\u2212/\u2212 cells, but not Jnk1\u2212/\u2212 cells, are unable to initiate virus-induced apoptosis and SeV further fails to trigger apoptosis in MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) knockout (Mkk7\u2212/\u2212) cells. Mechanistically, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which subsequently phosphorylates JNK2 and thus activates the apoptosis pathway. Consistently, Jnk2\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not Jnk1\u2212/\u2212 mice, display marked inflammatory injury in lung and liver after viral challenge. Collectively, we have identified a novel signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which mediates virus-induced apoptosis and highlights the indispensable role of mitochondrial outer membrane in host defenses.","publish_time":"2014-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yuefeng; Liu, Heng; Li, Senlin; Tang, Yijun; Wei, Bo; Yu, Huansha; Wang, Chen","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/740523d9e53ac786c0a45c790320c219cd0031a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3961361.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651600/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAVS","MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JNK2","virus-induced apoptosis","apoptosis pathway","MAVS-MKK7","MAVS recruits MKK7","virus-infected host cells","Sendai virus","SeV","mice","Jnk1","host defenses","mitochondrial antiviral","Viral infection","MAPK kinase","viral challenge","N-terminal kinase","indispensable role of mitochondrial outer membrane","lung","liver","marked inflammatory injury","VISA","protein","effective means","IPS","Cardif","innate immunity","knockout","D domain","underlying mechanisms","process","spread of pathogens","MAP kinases","novel"],"language":"en"},

Mortality rates associated with these infections have risen sharply due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of C. albicans and other Candida spp., highlighting the urgent need of new antifungal therapies. Rhesus theta (\u03B8) defensin-1 (RTD-1), a natural macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide, was recently shown to be rapidly fungicidal against clinical isolates of MDR C. albicans in vitro. Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity. Results of this study suggest that \u03B8-defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basso, Virginia; Tran, Dat Q.; Schaal, Justin B.; Tran, Patti; Eriguchi, Yoshihiro; Ngole, Diana; Cabebe, Anthony E.; Park, A. young; Beringer, Paul M.; Ouellette, Andr\u00E9 J.; Selsted, Michael E.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb289af3995ebdf5654f8553444b4dbc6ca30667.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6858451.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53402-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31729441/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhesus"],"organizations":["MDR C."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["albicans strains","MDR strains of","albicans biofilms","systemic administration of RTD","antifungal activity","antifungal effects","infected mice","direct fungicidal activity","new class of host","h post treatment","clinical isolates of MDR","treatment of disseminated candidiasis","urgent need of new antifungal therapies","candidemic mice","caspofungin resistant","\u03B8-defensins","fatal infections","peptide doses","time of infection","Invasive candidiasis","numbers of circulating neutrophils","emergence of multidrug resistant","natural macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide","restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines","long term survival","TNF-\u03B1","compounds","mechanisms","drug-sensitive","fungal clearance","maximal plasma concentrations","frequent cause of serious","homeostatic reduction","blastospores of fluconazole","mouse serum","Candida","transient neutrophilia","Cmax","immunosuppressed patients","study","Rhesus theta","monocytes","levels","efficacy","Mortality rates","Results"],"language":"en"},

Compared with other small-molecule modifiers found in phosphorylation, acetylation and glycosylation, ubiquitin is a small protein modifier that exists as either a single ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain. Furthermore, the polyubiquitin chains are formed via various linkages imparting an additional layer of specificity in cellular signaling. In order to adequately study ubiquitin signaling and particularly deubiquitination, a number of ubiquitin activity-based probes (ABPs) were developed and utilized in understanding the deubiquitinase (DUBs) function. Here, we focus on the current state of the DUB ABP development and their application in understanding DUB function and specificity for polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated proteins.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gui, Weijun; Paudel, Prajwal; Zhuang, Zhihao","journal":"Reference Module in Chemistry, Molecular Sciences and Chemical Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/129ca9620487d597268964c705884f95d39861c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157470.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124095472146724; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095472146724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polyubiquitin chains","single ubiquitin","understanding DUB function","small protein modifier","number of ubiquitin activity-based probes","protein degradation","DUB ABP development","numerous cellular functions","additional layer of specificity","small-molecule modifiers","tolerance","PTM","DNA damage repair","application","phosphorylation","important post-translational modification","various linkages","acetylation","glycosylation","cell cycle progression","current state","ABPs","ubiquitinated proteins","deubiquitination","Abstract Ubiquitination","deubiquitinase","DUBs","order"],"language":"en"},

The birnaviruses, with a bipartite dsRNA genome, constitute a well-established exception and have a single-shelled T =13 capsid only. Moreover, as in many negative single-stranded RNA viruses, the genomic dsRNA is bound to a nucleocapsid protein (VP3) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VPg). We used electron microscopy and functional analysis to characterize these RNP complexes of infectious bursal disease virus, the best characterized member of the Birnaviridae family. Mild disruption of viral particles revealed that VP3, the most abundant core protein, present at \u223C450 copies per virion, is found in filamentous material tightly associated with the dsRNA. We developed a method to purify RNP and VPg\u2013dsRNA complexes. Analysis of these complexes showed that they are linear molecules containing a constant amount of protein. Sensitivity assays to nucleases indicated that VP3 renders the genomic dsRNA less accessible for RNase III without introducing genome compaction.

We detected cytoplasmic accumulations containing the viral nucleocapsid protein, viral RNA and the non-structural protein nsp3. Using EM techniques, we found that these putative viral replication sites were associated with characteristic membrane tubules and double membrane vesicles that most probably originated from ER cisternae. In addition to its presence at the replication sites, N also accumulated in the Golgi region and colocalized with the viral spike protein. Immuno-EM revealed that budding occurred at membranes of the ERGIC (ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment) and the Golgi region as early as 3 h post infection, demonstrating that SARS-CoV replicates surprisingly fast. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV establishes replication complexes at ER-derived membranes.

This study aimed to evaluate compliance with standard precautions by analysis of the incidence and systems sources of such contaminations and by quantifying the use of personal protective equipment. Method A prospective observational study from 1 November 2005 to 30 April 2006, using analysis of video segments. Videotapes were recorded in two rooms designed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and compliance with basic infection control measures by all emergency department crews was monitored. Results A total of 44 consecutive performances of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were recorded for time-motion analysis. The percentages of staff wearing personal protective equipment were 90%, 50%, 20% and 75% for masks, eye protection, gowns and gloves, respectively. Compliance ranking scored doctors as high, trainees as moderate and nursing staff as low. Overall contamination rate was 16.9\u00D710\u22122 events/person-min. The two leading systems sources for contamination were lack of specific task assignments among rescuers (44%) and inadequate preparation for procedures (42%). Conclusions Among healthcare workers in the emergency setting, the study disclosed suboptimal compliance with basic infection control measures, including use of personal protective equipment and avoiding contamination. By further time-motion analysis of resuscitation sessions, major systems sources and strategies for improvement could be identified.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Wen-Chu; Wang, Hui-Chih; Chen, Shey-Ying; Chen, Li-Mei; Yao, Yu-Ching; Wu, Grace Hui-Min; Ko, Patrick Chow-In; Yang, Chih-Wei; Tsai, Ming-Tse; Hsai, Cheng-Chun; Su, Chan-Ping; Chen, Shyr-Chyr; Ma, Matthew Huei-Ming","journal":"Resuscitation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f07b967f20bab144645201dd33286e35005bee39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116997.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957208000038; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300957208000038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18343557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Objective Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of personal protective equipment","suboptimal compliance","time-motion analysis of resuscitation sessions","major systems sources","leading systems sources","basic infection control measures","emergency setting","emergency department crews","analysis of video segments","consecutive performances of cardiopulmonary resuscitation","prospective observational study","Overall contamination rate","Summary Objective Healthcare workers","nursing staff","percentages of staff","trainees","lack of specific task assignments","incidence","rescuers","strategies","scored doctors","standard precautions","hospital cardiac arrests","eye protection","gowns","improvement","contaminations","communicable disease","masks","gloves","total","Method","person-","rooms","Conclusions","inadequate preparation","procedures","events","Videotapes"],"language":"en"},

The disease results from the interaction of pathogens with the host immune system and is also affected by management procedures. Several pathogenic agents such as Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., group A rotavirus (RV-A), coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus; porcine epidemic diarrhea virus), as well as nematode and protozoan parasites, can be associated with disease cases. RESULTS: All bacterial, viral, protozoan, and parasitic agents here investigated, with the exception of Salmonella spp. as well as both coronaviruses, were detected in varying proportions in piglet fecal samples, and positive animals were equally distributed between case and control groups. A statistically significant difference between case and control groups was found only for Cystoisospora suis (p = 0.034) and Eimeria spp. (p = 0.047). When co-infections were evaluated, a statistically significant difference was found only for C. perfringens \u03B22 and C. suis (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pathogens in piglets alone does not determine the occurrence of diarrhea episodes. Thus, the indiscriminate use of antibiotic and anthelminthic medication should be re-evaluated. This study also reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis and correct interpretation of results as well as the relevance of control and prophylactic measures.","publish_time":"2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruiz, Vera L.

It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine. Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred. DISCUSSION: This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 affected patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Novi, Giovanni; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Briano, Federica; Toscanini, Federica; Tazza, Francesco; Uccelli, Antonio; Inglese, Matilde","journal":"Mult Scler Relat Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d10131424f7a54c7d7654185bf591b3fe359011a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156942.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820301978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315980/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820301978","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","elderly patients","infected patients","affected patients","B-cell","patient symptoms","Coronavirus disease","days","report","dampened immune response","overactive immune response","novel disease entity","complete B cell depletion","higher risks of disease complications","new symptoms","monoclonal antibody","high risk","primary progressive multiple sclerosis","putative role of immunosuppressive therapy","clinical deterioration","respiratory insufficiency","death","RESULTS","hospitalization","ocrelizumab","BACKGROUND","comorbidities","potential treatment","Phone interview follow-up","immunosuppressants","hypothesis","paper","DISCUSSION","Immunosuppression","home-quarantine","METHODS","world"],"language":"en"},

Recognition of ERAD substrates leads to their extraction through the ER membrane (retrotranslocation or dislocation), ubiquitination, and destruction by cytosolic proteasomes.

In Mexico, an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea, characterized by 100 % mortality in piglets, began in March 2014 in the State of Mexico. METHODS: The aim of this study was to confirm and identify porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in samples from piglets with suggestive clinical signs using virological, histological, and molecular techniques. Necropsy was performed on 13 piglets from two litters with initial and advanced clinical signs. Suggestive lesions of acute infection with PEDV were detected in histological sections of the small and large bowels; specifically, multiple virus particles with visible crown-shaped projections were observed using electron microscopy and negative staining. Viral isolation was performed in Vero cells with trypsin. Infection was monitored by observation of cytopathic effect, and titration was determined by TCID(50)/ml. The presence of the PEDV in cultures and clinical samples was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of a 651-bp segment of the S glycoprotein gene, as well as a 681-bp matrix protein gene. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence analysis of the Mexican isolates showed marked homology to viruses that circulated in 2013 in Colorado, USA.

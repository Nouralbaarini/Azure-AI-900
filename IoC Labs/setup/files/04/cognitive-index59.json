HHV-6A infection decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to morphological changes of mitochondria. The cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is known to be an important substrate for activated caspase-3. Caspase-9 was activated significantly in HHV-6A-infected cells, whereas caspase-8 was not activated obviously. Moreover, HHV-6A infection upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2.

Despite the severity of symptoms, therapeutic strategies for this pathologic condition are still poorly developed. Interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 is well known as an antiviral cytokine and low-dose IFN-\u03B1 has been reported to show antiinflammatory effects. Therefore, we investigated how this cytokine affected ARDS in a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice received sequential intratracheal administration of \u03B1-galactosylceramide (\u03B1-GalCer) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which resulted in the development of fulminant ARDS. These mice were then treated intranasally with IFN-\u03B1 and their survival, lung weight, pathological findings, and cytokine production were evaluated. Administration of low-dose IFN-\u03B1 prolonged survival of fulminant ARDS mice, but higher doses of IFN-\u03B1 did not. Histological analysis showed that low-dose IFN-\u03B1 treatment improved findings of diffuse alveolar damage in fulminant ARDS mice, which was associated with reduction in the wet/dry (W/D) lung weight ratio. Furthermore, IFN-\u03B3 production in the lungs was significantly reduced in IFN-\u03B1-treated mice, compared with control mice, but tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 production was almost equivalent for both groups. Low-dose IFN-\u03B1 shows antiinflammatory and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of fulminant ARDS, and reduced production of IFN-\u03B3 in the lung may be involved in the beneficial effect of this treatment.","publish_time":"2013-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kudo, Daisuke; Uno, Kazuko; Aoyagi, Tetsuji; Akahori, Yukiko; Ishii, Keiko; Kanno, Emi; Maruyama, Ryoko; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Kaku, Mitsuo; Kawakami, Kazuyoshi","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ad19700c433f9ef9163750966761e3c6c53640a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088027.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23407996/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10753-013-9607-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1 production","\u03B1-GalCer","dose IFN-\u03B1 prolonged survival of fulminant ARDS mice","IFN-\u03B3 production","reduced production of IFN","higher doses of IFN","treated mice","sequential intratracheal administration of \u03B1","low-dose IFN-\u03B1 treatment improved findings of diffuse alveolar damage","development of fulminant ARDS","control mice","mouse model of fulminant ARDS","cytokine production","Administration of low","lung weight ratio","severe lung inflammation","therapeutic effects","antiviral cytokine","antiinflammatory effects","pathological findings","therapeutic strategies","tumor necrosis factor","galactosylceramide","TNF","various diseases","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","lungs","severity of symptoms","pathologic condition","Histological analysis","reduction","C57BL","lipopolysaccharide","beneficial effect","LPS","groups","Interferon"],"language":"en"},

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been shown to induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, while the regulatory roles of PRRSV-encoded products in apoptosis are not fully understood. In the present study, we first showed a biphasic apoptosis regulation by a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06. It was indicated that PRRSV infection delays apoptosis at early infection but activates apoptosis at late infection in MARC-145 cells. In PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, procaspase-8, -9 and -12 were activated at late infection, demonstrating the involvements of death receptor pathway, mitochondrial pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in inducing apoptosis. PRRSV was also shown to induce a similar apoptosis process in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with an early initiation. Next, the PRRSV-encoded apoptosis inducers were screened, indicating that the nonstructural protein (Nsp) 4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV are pro-apoptotic. In the presence of Nsp4, it was confirmed that procaspase-8, -9 and -12 were cleaved, and Nsp4 facilitates the cleavage of procaspase-9 by activating B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), a pro-apoptotic protein. In addition, Nsp4 was shown to induce the degradation of an anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). Nsp10 was shown to activate procaspase-8 and -9 but procaspase-12 and to upregulate the expression of BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) and its active form, truncated Bid (tBid). Clearly, the participation of both activated caspase-8 and Bid is required for Nsp10-induced apoptosis, indicating a crosstalk between extrinsic- and mitochondria-dependent pathways.

This paper analyses the structure and dynamics of the origin and destination of core air travel market demand using 1995\u20132006 US quarterly time-series data. Despite the industry consolidating its network following the terrorist attacks of 2001, passenger travels in core markets have exhibited strong growth in recent years. This increase was driven mostly by the gains in the larger markets. When segmented by types of markets, super-thin markets are seen to have lost services while other markets gained. A majority of passengers use the thick markets that account for only a small portion of all markets and their demand has continued to grow. Relatively fewer passengers fly in the thin and super-thin markets, but they account for a substantial portion of all markets.

We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk assessment and risk management are highlighted. Case identification and laboratory capabilities and isolation procedures are the essential components for an initial hospital response. The recent bioterrorist events and the worldwide outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases have evidenced the need for institutional preparedness at each hospital and for identification of referral centers for patient isolation and of laboratories with adequate capabilities. Moreover, hospitals should develop a plan for coordinating all hospital components to respond to critical situations deriving from the admission of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrosillo, Nicola; Puro, Vincenzo; Di Caro, Antonino; Ippolito, Giuseppe","journal":"Archives of Medical Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c49f6dc889dcc616b6f567f52368dc392160f63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119125.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S018844090500189X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S018844090500189X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institute"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contagious infectious diseases","contagious diseases","hospital components","initial hospital response","model of hospital response","re-emergence of infectious diseases","communicable diseases","main components of hospital preparedness","novel infectious agents","prompt management of patients","risk management","essential components","Case identification","identification of referral centers","patient isolation","isolation procedures","admission of patients","risk assessment","laboratory capabilities","adequate capabilities","Prompt recognition","institutional preparedness","referral Institute","worldwide outbreaks","early diagnosis","exchange of views","need","immediate dissemination of information","nontraditional methods of public health surveillance","system","laboratories","indispensable step","epidemic","substantial number","critical situations","recent bioterrorist events","global impact","appearance","plan","importance","article","objective","decades","hospitals"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to infection might be more likely in animals than in human beings, given their closer relationship with the natural habitat of the yeast, vegetation and soil. Thus, animals, and especially pets, can act as indicators of the presence of this yeast in a determined area. Domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have become common pets in the past 10\u201320 years. Their natural behavior of sniffing around and going inside narrow spaces makes them prone to contact with decaying organic matter and soil, the substrate for Cryptococcus species. This study describes two cases of cryptococcosis in ferrets in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands and documents a relationship of ferret cryptococcosis with environmental isolates in the same locations. Here, we emphasize the importance of how an adequate identification and environmental search of the yeast leads to a better understanding of the epidemiology of cryptococcosis and suggests ferrets may act as sentinels for this fungal disease.","publish_time":"2014-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morera, Neus; Hagen, Ferry; Juan-Sall\u00E9s, Carles; Artigas, Carlos; Patricio, Rui; Serra, Juan Ignacio; Colom, M\u00AA Francisca","journal":"Mycopathologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/461376ba087980663244b082070af5039fea2249.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089463.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962111/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11046-014-9773-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cryptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mediterranean Basin","Iberian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["pathogenic environmental yeast","relationship of ferret cryptococcosis","environmental isolates","epidemiology of cryptococcosis","environmental search","Domestic ferrets","soil","cases of cryptococcosis","animals","closer relationship","natural habitat","common pets","Cryptococcus gattii","Cryptococcus species","natural behavior of sniffing","Mustela putorius furo","Balearic Islands","substrate","human beings","Iberian Peninsula","decaying organic matter","adequate identification","world","better understanding","vegetation","narrow spaces","infection","sentinels","presence","indicators","different areas","Mediterranean Basin","determined area","fungal disease","Exposure","importance","study","locations","years"],"language":"en"},

Although the interacting region in the nucleocapsid protein was mapped to residues 168\u2013208, the interacting region in the membrane protein and the interaction nature are still unclear. In this work, by using yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance techniques, the residues 197\u2013221 of the membrane protein and the residues 351\u2013422 of the nucleocapsid protein were determined to be involved in their interaction. Sequence analysis revealed that these two fragments are highly charged at neutral pH, suggesting that their interaction may be of ionic nature. Kinetic assays indicated that the endodomain (aa102\u2013221) of the membrane protein interacts with the nucleocapsid protein with high affinity (K D =0.55\u00B10.04\u03BCM), however, this interaction could be weakened greatly by acidification, higher salt concentration (400mM NaCl) and divalent cation (50mM Ca2\u002B), which suggests that electrostatic attraction might play an important role in this interaction. In addition, it is noted that two highly conserved amino acids (L218 and L219) in the membrane protein are not involved in this interaction. Here, we show that electrostatic interactions between the carboxyl termini of SARS-CoV membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein largely mediate the interaction of these two proteins. These results might facilitate therapeutic strategies aiming at the disruption of the association between SARS-CoV membrane and nucleocapsid proteins.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Haibin; Wu, Dalei; Shen, Can; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang","journal":"The International Journal of Biochemistry \u0026 Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c0fe8e995157887e074bfb82910792ddae0c799.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108423.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272505003754; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272505003754","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV membrane protein","interaction nature","abundant virion protein","SARS-CoV membrane","nucleocapsid proteins","residues","interacting region","carboxyl termini of SARS","electrostatic interactions","electrostatic attraction","ionic nature","L219","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","surface plasmon resonance techniques","NaCl","hybrid","L218","viral assembly","fragments","higher salt concentration","yeast","conserved amino acids","disruption","acidification","important role","high affinity","association","endodomain","therapeutic strategies","divalent cation","morphogenesis","aa102","neutral pH","Kinetic assays","Sequence analysis","results","Ca2","\u03BCM","work","addition"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE Objective: We assess the extent to which interest in preparing guns has increased amid the COVID-19 Pandemic using data from Google searches related to purchasing and cleaning guns. METHODS Methods: We fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model over Google search data from January 2004 up until the week that President Trump declared COVID-19 an emergency. We use this model to forecast Google search volumes, creating a counterfactual of the number of gun preparation searches we would expect if not for COVID-19, and report observed deviations from this counterfactual. RESULTS Results: Google searches related to preparing guns have surged to unprecedented levels, approximately 40% higher than previously reported spikes following the Sandy Hook, CT and Parkland, FL shootings and 158% (95%CI 73-270) greater than would be expected if not for COVID-19. In absolute terms, there were approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation over just 34 days. States severely affected by COVID-19 appear to have among the greatest increases in searches. CONCLUSIONS Conclusions: Our results corroborate media reports that gun purchases are increasing amid the Pandemic and provide more precise geographic and temporal trends. Policy makers should invest in disseminating evidence-based educational tools about gun risks and safety procedures to avert a collateral public health crisis.

We hypothesized that the diagnostic yield of BALs would be higher in more recent years due to new diagnostic assays. METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed among immunocompromised children \u226418 years old who underwent BALs from 2001 to 2012, to assess the yield of microbiologic diagnostic studies and to determine the impact of BAL findings on antimicrobial management. RESULTS: In all, 123 subjects underwent 174 BALs (mean age 9.9 years). Underlying diagnoses included both malignant (n = 79) and non\u2010malignant (n = 44) disorders, and 75 (61.0%) subjects were hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Fifty\u2010four (31.0%) of 174 BAL were positive for \u22651 potential pathogen (n = 58 microorganisms). The diagnostic yield of BALs performed from 2001 to 2006 versus2007\u20132012 was similar (40.5% vs. 26.6%, respectively, P = 0.07). Most subjects (86.2%) were on \u22651 antimicrobial at the time of BAL. Most (65.8%) negative BALs were associated with narrowing antimicrobial therapy, while most (74.1%) positive BALs were associated with continuing or changing to targeted antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, the diagnostic yield of BAL was similar to that previously described and unchanged in more recent years. Both negative and positive BALs were associated with changes in antimicrobial management. SUMMARY: A 10\u2010year retrospective review of bronchoalveolar lavage in 123 immunocompromised children determined that the rate of isolation of potential pathogens was 31% in this population.

Objectives We aimed to investigate the incidence and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP and to compare them with those of severe IFV associated CAP. Study design From March 2010 to August 2017, all consecutive adult patients with severe HMPV-associated CAP and severe influenza virus (IFV)-associated CAP who required intensive care unit admission were prospectively identified and followed in a 2,700-bed tertiary care hospital. The characteristics and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP patients were compared with those of severe IFV-associated CAP patients.

When a disease begins to spread in the population, the corresponding information would also be transmitted among individuals, which in turn influence the spreading pattern of the disease. In this paper, firstly, we analyze the propagation of two representative diseases (H7N9 and Dengue fever) in the real-world population and their corresponding information on Internet, suggesting the high correlation of the two-type dynamical processes. Secondly, inspired by empirical analyses, we propose a nonlinear model to further interpret the coupling effect based on the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model. Both simulation results and theoretical analysis show that a high prevalence of epidemic will lead to a slow information decay, consequently resulting in a high infected level, which shall in turn prevent the epidemic spreading. Finally, further theoretical analysis demonstrates that a multi-outbreak phenomenon emerges via the effect of coupling dynamics, which finds good agreement with empirical results.

However, in-depth analysis of these data show clear disparities in mortality rates between Wuhan (\u003E3%), different regions of Hubei (about 2\u00B79% on average), and across the other provinces of China (about 0\u00B77% on average). We postulate that this is likely to be related to the rapid escalation in the number of infections around the epicentre of the outbreak, which has resulted in an insufficiency of health-care resources, thereby negatively affecting patient outcomes in Hubei, while this has not yet been the situation for the other parts of China (figure A, B). If we assume that average levels of health care are similar throughout China, higher numbers of infections in a given population can be considered an indirect indicator of a heavier health-care burden. Plotting mortality against the incidence of COVID-19 (cumulative number of confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak, per 10 000 population) showed a significant positive correlation (figure C), suggesting that mortality is correlated with health-care burden.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Yunpeng; Ma, Zhongren; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P; Pan, Qiuwei","journal":"Lancet Glob Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128131.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214109X20300681; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X20300681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109372/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30068-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["average mortality","average levels of health care","heavier health-care burden","care resources","China CDC","parts of China","insufficiency of health","provinces of China","mortality rates","number of infections","outbreak","cumulative number of confirmed cases","given population","figure C","incidence of COVID","higher numbers of infections","different regions of Hubei","clear disparities","Prevention","Disease Control","data","significant positive correlation","indirect indicator","Chinese Center","Wuhan","start","in-depth analysis","patient outcomes","rapid escalation","deaths","epicentre","situation"],"language":"en"},

It potently inhibited mycelial growth in a number of fungal species including Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium maydis, Mycosphaerella arachidicola and Valsa mali. The antifungal activity of brassiparin toward M. arachidicola exhibited pronounced thermostability and pH stability. It inhibited proliferation of hepatoma (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF7) cells and the activity of HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase. Its N\u2010terminal sequence differed from those of antifungal proteins which have been reported to date. Conclusions: Brassiparin can be purified by using a protocol involving ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and gel filtration.

A large range of etiologic agents challenge the development of efficient therapies. Research suggests that probiotics are able to decrease the risk or duration of respiratory infection symptoms. However, the antiviral mechanisms of probiotics are unclear. The purpose of this paper is to review the current knowledge on the effects of probiotics on respiratory virus infections and to provide insights on the possible antiviral mechanisms of probiotics. A PubMed and Scopus database search was performed up to January 2014 using appropriate search terms on probiotic and respiratory virus infections in cell models, in animal models, and in humans, and reviewed for their relevance. Altogether, thirty-three clinical trials were reviewed. The studies varied highly in study design, outcome measures, probiotics, dose, and matrices used. Twenty-eight trials reported that probiotics had beneficial effects in the outcome of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and five showed no clear benefit. Only eight studies reported investigating viral etiology from the respiratory tract, and one of these reported a significant decrease in viral load. Based on experimental studies, probiotics may exert antiviral effects directly in probiotic\u2013virus interaction or via stimulation of the immune system. Although probiotics seem to be beneficial in respiratory illnesses, the role of probiotics on specific viruses has not been investigated sufficiently. Due to the lack of confirmatory studies and varied data available, more randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials in different age populations investigating probiotic dose response, comparing probiotic strains/genera, and elucidating the antiviral effect mechanisms are necessary.","publish_time":"2014-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehtoranta, L.; Pitk\u00E4ranta, A.; Korpela, R.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8ebfc9d742812e0451a90829bf6d68595abdac4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088122.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-014-2086-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of probiotics","role of probiotics","respiratory virus infections","Viral respiratory infections","possible antiviral mechanisms of probiotics","respiratory illnesses","outcome of respiratory tract infections","antiviral effects","antiviral effect mechanisms","probiotic strains","beneficial effects","duration of respiratory infection symptoms","experimental studies","probiotic dose response","virus interaction","lack of confirmatory studies","viral etiology","viral load","clinical trials","humans","placebo-controlled trials","cell models","outcome measures","animal models","significant decrease","varied data available","appropriate search terms","Scopus database search","different age populations","risk","insights","stimulation","genera","study design","RTIs","large range of etiologic agents","common diseases","development of efficient therapies","current knowledge","paper","PubMed","specific viruses","immune system","Research","matrices","clear benefit","purpose","relevance"],"language":"en"},

To date, the cellular factors involved in PEDV replication have not been well defined. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that serves as a critical component of cellular signal transduction pathways to modulate a variety of cellular functions has been shown to regulate several viral infections. In the present study, we found that PEDV activates ERK1/2 early in infection independently of viral replication. The PEDV-induced ERK1/2 activation resulted in the phosphorylation of its downstream substrate Elk-1 in infected cells. Treatment with ERK inhibitors or ERK1/2 knockdown significantly suppressed viral progeny production. Inhibition of ERK activation also diminished viral protein expression and genomic and subgenomic RNA transcription. These findings indicate that the ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in the PEDV life cycle and beneficially contributes to viral infection.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Youngnam; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5073f61639f9524e70d832bf62e30bcd19329e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111633.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26115165/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215002846; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.06.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215002846","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV replication","viral replication","PEDV-induced ERK1","viral infections","ERK inhibitors","PEDV life cycle","viral protein expression","Inhibition of ERK activation","viral progeny production","cellular factors","variety of cellular functions","critical component of cellular signal transduction pathways","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","acute enteritis","important role","knockdown","high mortality","subgenomic RNA transcription","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","downstream substrate Elk","enteropathogenic coronavirus of swine","nursery piglets","phosphorylation","infected cells","Treatment","date","findings","present study"],"language":"en"},

We investigated whether the microbiological profiling could be used to differentiate between these two conditions. METHODS: Children up to five years of age, with rAOM (n = 45) or COME (n = 129) and scheduled for tympanostomy tube insertion were enrolled in a prospective study between 2008 and 2009. Middle ear fluids (n = 119) and nasopharyngeal samples (n = 173) were collected during surgery for bacterial culture and PCR analysis to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and to detect 15 distinct respiratory viruses. RESULTS: The occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens in middle ear fluids did not significantly differ between patients suffering from rAOM and COME. In both patient cohorts, H. influenzae and rhinovirus were the predominant pathogens in the middle ear and nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal carriage with two or three bacterial pathogens was associated with the presence of bacteria in middle ear fluid (P = 0.04). The great majority of the bacteria isolated from middle ear fluid were genetically identical to nasopharyngeal isolates from the same patient.

IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at sub-codon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33\u201340%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3\u2019 untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection.","publish_time":"2019-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinan, Adam M.; Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica; Britton, Paul; Firth, Andrew E.; Brierley, Ian","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e6bd4f9d794f87445f67c9ed9d5699706040fa4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/152f63d871ed805dd8407e2470acba88a61816e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/612614","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","PRF","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV transcripts","IBV infection","IBV isolates","IBV M41-CK","attenuated forms of IBV","improved understanding of IBV molecular biology","abundant structural component of mature IBV virions","profiling data","gene networks","translation efficiencies of host genes","understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression","virus infection","Beau-CK strains","PRF","attenuated Beau-CK strain","novel transcription junction sites","genomic RNA ORF1a","RiboSeq data sets","precise study of transcription","high-resolution data","RNASeq","RNA sequencing","host cell reponse","host cell response","level of transcription","intergenic genes","Infectious bronchitis virus","altered production of sgmRNA transcripts","novel ribosomally occupied ORFs","related mRNA transcripts","major avian pathogen","numerous cellular genes","causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis","ORF1b junction","ribosome profiling","positive-sense RNA genome","viral polymerase","global spread","set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs","single nucleotide polymorphisms","sub-codon resolution","Improved vaccination strategies","precise determination of reading frames","considerable intra-species variation","signal","substantial economic burden","sgmRNAs","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","regulation of immune","modest changes","insights","genus Gammacoronavirus","poultry industry","member","nucleocapsid","development of suitable vaccine candidates","Quantification of reads","untranslated region","Triplet phasing","dORF","coronaviruses","length","sgmRNA4","protein","measurements"],"language":"en"},

Nurses are providing care to patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization. To ensure adequate response capacity and to maintain the health of nurses at risk of infection, it is important to analyse the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift among frontline nurses. Objective To analyse the actual work hours and preferred work hours per shift of nurses reports among frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the influencing factors on the nurses reported preferred work hours. Design Cross-sectional survey Setting(s) This study was conducted in 10 designated hospitals providing treatments to patients with COVID-19 in China. Participants Nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 in designated hospitals in China. Methods A self-designed questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to assess frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 cases in 10 designated hospitals. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the actual work hours, the nurses reported preferred work hours and factors influencing nurses reported preferred work hours among the frontline nurses. Results A total of 109 nurses responded to the survey. The actual work hours per shift among frontline nurses were exceeded the nurses reported preferred work hours [Median (interquartile range): 5.00(2.00) h vs 4.00 (2.00)h; Minmum-Maxmum: 4-12 h vs 4-8 h], and 60.55% (66/109) of the nurses regarded 4 h as the preferred number of work hours per shift. Five key themes associated with the influencing factors emerged, including circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and emotional needs of nurse, the safety needs of nurse and work intensity. Conclusions These findings suggest that there is a gap between the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours among frontline nurses in different units and different posts. The main influencing factors were circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and emotional needs of nurse, the safety needs of nurse and work intensity.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xia; Jiang, Zhixia; Yuan, Xiaoli; Wang, Ying; Huang, Di; Hu, Rujun; Zhou, Jiamei; Chen, Fang","journal":"International journal of nursing studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7a26dfa4d393b763ccb4cb14022daba0615e4e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002074892030119X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425239/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103635; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074892030119X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["preferred work hours","frontline nurses","actual work hours","shift of nurses","health of nurses","Participants Nurses","preferred number of work hours","work intensity","COVID","h vs","safety needs of nurse","emotional needs of nurse","main influencing factors","patients","designated hospitals","China","personal preventable equipment","circumstances","care","different units","different posts","qualitative methods","Design Cross-sectional survey Setting","open-ended questions","Median","self-designed questionnaire","novel coronavirus disease","study","interquartile range","Abstract Background","risk of infection","treatments","gap","cases","Minmum-Maxmum","key themes","adequate response capacity","Objective","people","findings","world","deaths","Conclusions","hospitalization","total"],"language":"en"},

Exploring methods of compulsion and persuasion utilised across Europe, the USA and Australia, this paper argues that necessity and proportionality must be reassessed, and national public health law and policy setting out a graduated and proportionate approach to compulsory vaccination developed as a matter of priority.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cave, Emma","journal":"Leg Stud (Soc Leg Scholars)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d4c4ef9c5def66606502be9eb38c63d756640da.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/lest.12144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UN Convention"],"locations":["England","Wales","Europe"],"keyphrases":["voluntary vaccination policy","compulsory vaccination of adults","behalf","potential policy option","transmission of vaccine","preventable pandemic outbreak","preventable disease present challenges","England","Wales rests","individual responsibilities","trustees","global nature","respect","context","national public health law","children\u0027s best interests","proportionate approach","persuasion","paper","Europe","Australia","USA","emphasis","parents","tenuous foundations","sufficient supply","preventive medicine","Convention","globalisation","preparedness strategies","pandemics","Rights","necessity","proportionality","arguments","ground","Justification","methods of compulsion","matter of priority"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Proteome and histone lysine acetylation were profiled through stable isotope labeling for cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics. The quantifiable proteome was annotated using bioinformatics. Histone acetylation changes were validated by biochemistry assays. RESULTS: Post BDV infection, 4383 quantifiable differential proteins were identified and functionally annotated to metabolism pathways, immune response, DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Sixteen of the thirty identified Kac sites in core histones presented altered acetylation levels post infection.

The health systems as well as healthcare structure and provisions vary considerably. Consequently, the progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in these countries also varies. This paper aims to describe the progress toward UHC in the ASEAN countries and discuss how regional integration could influence UHC. DESIGN: Data reported in this paper were obtained from published literature, reports, and gray literature available in the ASEAN countries. We used both online and manual search methods to gather the information and \u2018snowball\u2019 further data. RESULTS: We found that, in general, ASEAN countries have made good progress toward UHC, partly due to relatively sustained political commitments to endorse UHC in these countries. However, all the countries in ASEAN are facing several common barriers to achieving UHC, namely 1) financial constraints, including low levels of overall and government spending on health; 2) supply side constraints, including inadequate numbers and densities of health workers; and 3) the ongoing epidemiological transition at different stages characterized by increasing burdens of non-communicable diseases, persisting infectious diseases, and reemergence of potentially pandemic infectious diseases. The ASEAN Economic Community\u0027s (AEC) goal of regional economic integration and a single market by 2015 presents both opportunities and challenges for UHC. Healthcare services have become more available but health and healthcare inequities will likely worsen as better-off citizens of member states might receive more benefits from the liberalization of trade policy in health, either via regional outmigration of health workers or intra-country health worker movement toward private hospitals, which tend to be located in urban areas. For ASEAN countries, UHC should be explicitly considered to mitigate deleterious effects of economic integration. Political commitments to safeguard health budgets and increase health spending will be necessary given liberalization\u0027s risks to health equity as well as migration and population aging which will increase demand on health systems. There is potential to organize select health services regionally to improve further efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that ASEAN has significant potential to become a force for better health in the region. We hope that all ASEAN citizens can enjoy higher health and safety standards, comprehensive social protection, and improved health status. We believe economic and other integration efforts can further these aspirations.","publish_time":"2014-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Minh, Hoang; Pocock, Nicola Suyin; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn; Chhorvann, Chhea; Duc, Ha Anh; Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Lim, Jeremy; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo; Ng, Nawi; Phaholyothin, Natalie; Phonvisay, Alay; Soe, Kyaw Min; Sychareun, Vanphanom","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88f1de42ca135e68ca9aa6a10081091fc4443028.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4256544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25476931/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.25856","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASEAN","Universal Health Coverage","ASEAN Economic Community\u0027s","UHC","Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health spending","health services","health systems","health equity","higher health","health budgets","better health","health outcomes","ASEAN countries","UHC","densities of health workers","improved health status","Universal Health Coverage","regional outmigration of health workers","ASEAN citizens","ASEAN Economic Community\u0027s","intra-country health worker movement","regional integration","goal of regional economic integration","economic development","deleterious effects of economic integration","integration efforts","Healthcare services","pandemic infectious diseases","good progress","healthcare inequities","healthcare structure","political commitments","paper","Data","gray literature available","government spending","burdens of non-communicable diseases","published literature","financial constraints","significant potential","better-off citizens of member states","comprehensive social protection","AEC","necessary given liberalization\u0027s risks","safety standards","low levels of overall","inadequate numbers","society","different stages","private hospitals","benefits","information","reports","force","reemergence","supply","single market","Association of Southeast Asian Nations","terms of geography","ongoing epidemiological transition","liberalization of trade policy","manual search methods","opportunities","diversity","common barriers","population","BACKGROUND","demand","snowball","provisions","aspirations","DESIGN","challenges","efficiency","urban areas","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Strict infection control measures were taken in the hospital where an imported case with MERS was treated in southern China and 53 health care workers were confirmed to be MERS-CoV negative. Infection control in healthcare settings, in which patients with emerging infectious diseases such as MERS, Ebola virus disease, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are diagnosed and treated, are often imperfect. When it comes to emerging or unknown infectious diseases, before the imported case was finally identified or community transmission was reported, cases have often occurred in clusters in healthcare settings. Nosocomial infection control measures should be further strengthened among the workers and inpatients in designated healthcare settings that accommodate suspected cases suffering from emerging or unknown infectious diseases.

Mancur Olson suggests that a rational individual will not participate in collective action which provides no positive net benefit for him or her. Based on this premise, it would seem that rationality drives homeowners to free-ride on others\u2019 efforts and that, as a result, no collective action will take place. However, some homeowners do actively participate in housing management, and it is worthwhile to examine why some participate and others do not. Building on the wide-ranging applications of the collective interest model (CIM) in explaining political participation and environmental activism, this paper expands its relevance to the arena of housing management. The explanatory analysis which is based on the findings of a structured questionnaire survey in Hong Kong corroborates the central propositions of the CIM and provides a theoretical account of housing management activism. In brief, housing management activism is a function of beliefs about personal and group efficacy, the value of the collective good, and the selective benefits and costs of participation. These findings have far-reaching implications for the formulation of government policies promoting homeowners\u2019 active involvement in housing management in Hong Kong and other megacities.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yau, Yung","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/626fd7c8ea1eb23c6160c09bdfac9864bb6196ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124266.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397510000779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287696/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2010.11.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397510000779","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mancur Olson"],"organizations":["CIM"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["arena of housing management","collective action","theoretical account of housing management activism","collective homeowner action","Abstract Management of apartment buildings","Hong Kong","environmental activism","CIM","findings","political participation","costs of participation","rationality drives homeowners","homeowners\u2019 active involvement","formulation of government policies","free-ride","function of beliefs","structured questionnaire survey","group efficacy","value","paper","model","selective benefits","relevance","far-reaching implications","rational individual","central propositions","others\u2019 efforts","need","positive net benefit","Mancur Olson","wide-ranging applications","result","megacities","brief","place","explanatory analysis","premise"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. 14 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Incidence of the common cold was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and duration of the common cold was reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Weighted averages and mean differences were calculated by a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird methodology). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and review of L\u0027Abb\u00E9 plots, and publication bias was assessed through the Egger weighted regression statistic and visual inspection of funnel plots. Echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% (OR 0\u00B742; 95% CI 0\u00B725\u20130\u00B771; Q statistic p\u003C0\u00B7001) and the duration of a cold by 1\u00B74 days (WMD \u22121\u00B744, \u22122\u00B724 to \u22120\u00B764; p=0\u00B701). Similarly, significant reductions were maintained in subgroup analyses limited to Echinaguard/Echinacin use, concomitant supplement use, method of cold exposure, Jadad scores less than 3, or use of a fixed-effects model.

Clinical observations are of little help to recognise myxovirus infection and implement appropriate prevention measures. The limited use of molecular tools underestimates the role of other common pathogens. OBJECTIVES: During the early weeks of the 2009\u20132010 flu pandemic, a clinical and virological survey was conducted in adult and paediatric patients with ILI referred to two French University hospitals in Paris and Tours. Aims were to investigate the different pathogens involved in ILI and describe the associated symptoms. METHODS: H1N1v pandemic influenza diagnosis was performed with real time RT-PCR assay. Other viral aetiologies were investigated by the molecular multiplex assay RespiFinder19\u00AE. Clinical data were collected prospectively by physicians using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: From week 35 to 44, endonasal swabs were collected in 413 patients. Overall, 68 samples (16.5%) were positive for H1N1v. In 13 of them, other respiratory pathogens were also detected. Among H1N1v negative samples, 213 (61.9%) were positive for various respiratory agents, 190 in single infections and 23 in mixed infections. The most prevalent viruses in H1N1v negative single infections were rhinovirus (62.6%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (24.2%) and adenovirus (5.3%). 70.6% of H1N1v cases were identified in patients under 40 years and none after 65 years. There was no difference between clinical symptoms observed in patients infected with H1N1v or with other pathogens. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the high frequency of non-influenza viruses involved in ILI during the pre-epidemic period of a flu alert and the lack of specific clinical signs associated with influenza infections. Rapid diagnostic screening of a large panel of respiratory pathogens may be critical to define and survey the epidemic situation and to provide critical information for patient management.","publish_time":"2011-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schnepf, Nathalie; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Chaillon, Antoine; Scemla, Anne; Gras, Guillaume; Semoun, Oren; Taboulet, Pierre; Molina, Jean-Michel; Simon, Fran\u00E7ois; Goudeau, Alain; LeGoff, J\u00E9r\u00F4me","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4c1afe385e9e31eb5678e15a3c280ba97326554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3157400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21858150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","Rapid"],"locations":["Paris"],"keyphrases":["ILI","influenza infections","H1N1v negative single infections","clinical symptoms","H1N1v cases","common pathogens","different pathogens","variety of pathogens","H1N1v negative samples","H1N1v pandemic influenza diagnosis","Clinical observations","Clinical data","large panel of respiratory pathogens","mixed infections","paediatric patients","high frequency of non-influenza viruses","flu pandemic","prevalent viruses","lack of specific clinical signs","parainfluenza viruses","RESULTS","associated symptoms","years","various respiratory agents","flu alert","critical information","epidemic situation","molecular multiplex assay RespiFinder19","virological survey","pre-epidemic period","limited use of molecular tools","real time RT-PCR assay","myxovirus infection","French University hospitals","little help","role","adult","Rapid diagnostic screening","appropriate prevention measures","Paris","Tours","physicians","METHODS","rhinovirus","patient management","endonasal swabs","illness","difference","early weeks","viral aetiologies","OBJECTIVES","standard questionnaire","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","Aims","adenovirus"],"language":"en"},

In addition, various volumes of a solution (0.125 M sucrose plus Amaranth dye) were fed to 3-d-old adult female house flies to quantify the crop contraction rate as affected by crop volume. As crop volume increased, the contraction rate increased until it reached a peak at 2 \u03BCl, after which it declined. It is hypothesized that the high contraction rate of the crop, which in house fly is almost twice the rate of three other fly species, is one of the factors that makes house fly an excellent vector.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the appropriate management and compliance to the current guidelines in adults with encephalitis. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter study at 17 hospitals in the Greater Houston area from August 1, 2008 through September 30, 2017. All cases met the definition for possible or probable encephalitis as per the international encephalitis consortium guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 241 adults (age \u003E17 years) with encephalitis were enrolled. The most common etiologies were unknown (41.9 %), viral (27.8 %) and autoimmune (21.2 %). An adverse clinical outcome was seen in 49 % with 12.4 % in hospital mortality. A high compliance with guidelines (\u003E90 %) was only seen in obtaining a brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gram stain and culture. A CSF herpes virus simplex (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done in 84 % and only repeated in 14.2 % of patients with an initial negative result. Furthermore, only two-thirds of patients were started empirically on intravenous acyclovir and antibiotics. Evaluation for other etiologies were not uniformly performed: arboviral serologies (57.3 %), CSF anti-N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor (NMDA) receptor antibody (35.7 %), and CSF varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR (32 %). The highest yield for the tests were arboviral serologies (42 %), anti-NMDA antibodies (41.2 %) and VZV PCR (16.4 %). CONCLUSION: The management of encephalitis as per current guidelines is suboptimal leading to underutilization of currently available diagnostic tests and empirical therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samannodi, Mohammed; Hansen, Michael; Allana, Ambreen; Hasbun, Rodrigo","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31418ec9e2f825015f34a6eca15a9b1e95829fa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194944.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315818/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104369; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301116; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301116","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF","PCR","VZV PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["encephalitis management","management of encephalitis","probable encephalitis","current guidelines","international encephalitis consortium guidelines","VZV PCR","CSF herpes virus simplex","CSF varicella zoster virus","CSF anti-N-Methyl","appropriate management","adults","arboviral serologies","high compliance","anti-NMDA antibodies","STUDY DESIGN","receptor antibody","thirds of patients","common etiologies","hospital mortality","d-Aspartate Receptor","available diagnostic tests","retrospective multicenter study","scan","HSV","cerebrospinal fluid","underutilization","blood cultures","hospitals","polymerase chain reaction","gram stain","brain computerized tomography","significant neurological disability","empirical therapy","definition","years","highest yield","Greater Houston area","intravenous acyclovir","initial negative result","total","adverse clinical outcome","antibiotics","cases","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Evaluation"],"language":"en"},

The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab.

These results indicate that saliva proteins reflect physiopathological changes that occur in PVE and could be a potential source of biomarkers for this disease.","publish_time":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franco-Mart\u00EDnez, Lorena; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Horvati\u0107, Anita; Guillemin, Nicolas; Cer\u00F3n, Jos\u00E9 Joaqu\u00EDn; Escribano, Dami\u00E1n; Eckersall, David; Kocat\u00FCrk, Meri\u00E7; Yilmaz, Zeki; Lamy, Elsa; Mart\u00EDnez-Subiela, Silvia; Mrljak, Vladimir","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/001ec025dd65db8a47827c8f49d9c41d60f35d00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124818.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957118300742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2018.09.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957118300742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tandem Mass Tags","PVE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PVE","saliva proteins","disease","healthy dogs","Bioinformatics\u2019 analysis","Saliva samples","high-throughput quantitative proteomic analysis","physiopathological changes","different abundances","involvement of different pathways","salivary proteome","binding","parvoviral enteritis","catalytic activity","antimicrobial humoral response","Tandem Mass Tags","major role","TMT","severe parvovirosis","potential source of biomarkers","present study","studied groups","development","results","peptides"],"language":"en"},

The Clinical utilisation of respiratory elastance (CURE) trial is a two-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the performance of PEEP selected at an objective, model-based minimal respiratory system elastance in patients with ARDS. METHODS AND DESIGN: The CURE RCT compares two groups of patients requiring invasive MV with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio \u2264 200; one criterion of the Berlin consensus definition of moderate (\u2264 200) or severe (\u2264 100) ARDS. All patients are ventilated using pressure controlled (bi-level) ventilation with tidal volume = 6\u20138 ml/kg. Patients randomised to the control group will have PEEP selected per standard practice (SPV). Patients randomised to the intervention will have PEEP selected based on a minimal elastance using a model-based computerised method. The CURE RCT is a single-centre trial in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Christchurch hospital, New Zealand, with a target sample size of 320 patients over a maximum of 3 years. The primary outcome is the area under the curve (AUC) ratio of arterial blood oxygenation to the fraction of inspired oxygen over time. Secondary outcomes include length of time of MV, ventilator-free days (VFD) up to 28 days, ICU and hospital length of stay, AUC of oxygen saturation (SpO(2))/FiO(2) during MV, number of desaturation events (SpO(2) \u003C 88%), changes in respiratory mechanics and chest x-ray index scores, rescue therapies (prone positioning, nitric oxide use, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and hospital and 90-day mortality. DISCUSSION: The CURE RCT is the first trial comparing significant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS in whom PEEP is selected at minimum elastance using an objective model-based method able to quantify and consider both inter-patient and intra-patient variability. CURE aims to demonstrate the hypothesized benefit of patient-specific PEEP and attest to the significance of real-time monitoring and decision-support for MV in the critical care environment.

PCV2 triggers a weak and atypical innate immune response, but the key genes and mechanisms by which the virus interferes with host innate immunity have not yet been elucidated. In this study, genes that control the response of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), the main target of PCV2, were profiled in vitro. RESULTS: PAMs were successfully infected by PCV2-WH strain, as evidenced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results. Infection-related differential gene expression was investigated using pig microarrays from the US Pig Genome Coordination Program and validated by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microarray analysis at 24 and 48 hours post-infection (HPI) revealed 266 and 175 unique genes, respectively, that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate \u003C0.05; fold-change \u003E2). Only six genes were differentially expressed between 24 and 48 HPI. The up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, cytokine activity, locomotion, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and antigen procession and presentation. The down-regulated genes were mainly involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, proteasome degradation, signal transducer activity, and ribosomal proteins, which were representative of the reduced vital activity of PCV2-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: PCV2 infection of PAMs causes up-regulation of genes related to inflammation, indicating that PCV2 may induce systematic inflammation. PCV2 persistently induced cytokines, mainly through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and TLR9 pathways, which may promote high levels of cytokine secretion. PCV2 may prevent apoptosis in PAMs by up-regulating SERPINB9 expression, possibly to lengthen the duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions. The observed gene expression profile may provide insights into the underlying immunological response and pathological changes that occur in pigs following PCV2 infection.","publish_time":"2013-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wentao; Liu, Shuqing; Wang, Yang; Deng, Feng; Yan, Weidong; Yang, Kun; Chen, Huanchun; He, Qigai; Charreyre, Catherine; Audoneet, Jean-Christophe","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3498e7e96b742565d9041107cae12e667b394f9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3680065.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23711280/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Pig Genome Coordination Program"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 infection of PAMs","regulation of genes","regulated genes","PCV2-WH strain","main target of PCV2","reduced vital activity of PCV2","key genes","unique genes","duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions","Infection-related differential gene expression","cytokine activity","atypical innate immune response","underlying immunological response","apoptosis","SERPINB9 expression","hours post-infection","HPI","RESULTS","response of primary porcine alveolar macrophages","observed gene expression profile","signal transducer activity","regulation of cell proliferation","real-time PCR","pig microarrays","immunofluorescence assay","infected cells","systematic inflammation","cell growth arrest","Porcine circovirus type","host innate immunity","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","high levels of cytokine secretion","US Pig Genome Coordination Program","evidenced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","translation","qPCR","proteasome degradation","insights","locomotion","carbohydrate metabolism","terpenoid biosynthesis","pathological changes","syndrome","antigen procession","causal agent of postweaning multisystemic","representative","ribosomal proteins","Toll","TLR9 pathways","ELISA","IFA","pigs","false discovery rate","fold-change","receptor","PMWS","presentation","BACKGROUND","mechanisms","induced cytokines","CONCLUSIONS","Microarray analysis","study","swine industry"],"language":"en"},

Results Three hundred paramedics were given the survey, and 95 (32%) responded. More than 80% of paramedics polled would not remain on duty if there were no vaccine and no protective gear. Even if protective gear was available but the vaccine was unavailable, only 39% of respondents would remain on duty. Finally, although 91% of paramedics would remain on duty if they were fully protected, this number falls to 38% if the respondent believed that his or her immediate family was not protected.

Transmission heterogeneity was observed during the 2015 Korean outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Only 22 of 186 cases transmitted the infection, and 5 super-spreading events caused 150 transmissions. We investigated the risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission. METHODS. Epidemiological reports were used to classify patients as nonspreaders, spreaders, or those associated with a super-spreading event (5 or more transmissions). Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the factors for MERS-CoV transmission. RESULTS. Compared to nonspreaders, spreaders exhibited a longer interval from symptom onset to isolation (7 days vs 3 days) and more frequent pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses (68.2% vs 17.1%). Spreaders also exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (149 vs 17.5), pre-isolation hospitalization (68.2% vs 16.5%), and emergency room (ER) visits (50% vs 7.3%). Spreaders exhibited lower cycle thresholds for the upE and ORF1a genes (22.7 vs 27.2 and 23.7 vs 27.9, respectively). In multivariate analysis, transmission was independently associated with the cycle threshold (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75\u20130.96) and pre-isolation hospitalization or ER visits (OR, 6.82; 95% CI, 2.06\u201322.84). The super-spreading events exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (777 vs 78), pre-isolation ER visits (100% vs 35.3%), and doctor shopping (100% vs 47.1%) compared to non-super-spreading events. CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate that transmission is determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts, whereas super-spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits. These relationships highlight the importance of rapidly enforcing infection control measures to prevent outbreaks.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Seung Woo; Park, Jung Wan; Jung, Hee-Dong; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Park, Yong-Shik; Lee, Changhwan; Kim, Kyung Min; Lee, Keon-Joo; Kwon, Donghyok; Hur, Young Joo; Choi, BoYoul; Ki, Moran","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ae25d6e02290cf27ded2f9f8233d3c7f9bdbbce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108049.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciw768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ER"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["days vs","pre-isolation contacts","pre-isolation hospitalization","pre-isolation ER visits","non-super-spreading events","MERS-CoV transmission","frequent pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses","number of contacts","Transmission heterogeneity","hospital visits","higher values","nonspreaders","transmissions","enforcing infection control measures","longer interval","risk factors","confidence interval","lower cycle thresholds","Korean outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","symptom onset","importance","ORF1a genes","outbreaks","patients","host infectivity","emergency room","odds ratio","Logistic regression analyses","doctor shopping","Epidemiological reports","relationships","multivariate analysis","cases","findings","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Residents \u226565 years from 32 nursing homes in 4 Canadian cities were enrolled in Fall 2009, 2010 and 2011, and followed for one influenza season. Following influenza vaccination, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained and analysed by flow cytometry for T-regs, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T-cell subsets (CCR7\u002BCD45RA\u002B, CCR7-CD45RA\u002B and CD28-CD57\u002B) and CMV-reactive CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T-cells. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for viruses in symptomatic residents. A Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex and frailty, determined the relationship between immune phenotypes and time to viral infection. RESULTS: 1072 residents were enrolled; median age 86 years and 72% female. 269 swabs were obtained, 87 were positive for virus: influenza (24%), RSV (14%), coronavirus (32%), rhinovirus (17%), human metapneumovirus (9%) and parainfluenza (5%). In multivariable analysis, high T-reg% (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20\u20130.81) and high CMV-reactive CD4\u002B T-cell% (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03\u20132.78) were predictive of respiratory viral infection.

Analysis of these systems revealed distinct pathogenic mechanisms involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by each organism. In T. gondii infections, the chronic reactivation is probably responsible for the presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes of the immune system. In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and the human RPE protein may contribute to retinal pathology.

However, few in vitro model systems to date allow assessment of zoonotic viruses in a relevant host context. The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a New World rodent species that has a long-standing history as an experimental animal model due to its unique susceptibility to human viruses. Furthermore, wild cotton rats are associated with a large variety of known or potentially zoonotic pathogens. METHODS: A method for the isolation and culture of airway epithelial cell lines recently developed for bats was applied for the generation of rodent airway and renal epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat. Continuous cell lines were characterized for their epithelial properties as well as for their interferon competence. Susceptibility to members of zoonotic Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Flaviviridae, in particular Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was tested. Furthermore, novel arthropod-derived viruses belonging to the families Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae were tested. RESULTS: We successfully established airway and kidney epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat, and characterized their epithelial properties. Cells were shown to be interferon-competent. Viral infection assays showed high-titre viral replication of RVFV, VSV, WNV, and TBEV, as well as production of infectious virus particles. No viral replication was observed for novel arthropod-derived members of the Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae families in these cell lines. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we showed that newly established cell lines from the cotton rat can serve as host-specific in vitro models for viral infection experiments. These cell lines may also serve as novel tools for virus isolation, as well as for the investigation of virus-host interactions in a relevant host species.","publish_time":"2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehlen, Lukas; T\u00F6dtmann, Jan; Specht, Sabine; Kallies, Ren\u00E9; Papies, Jan; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Junglen, Sandra; Drosten, Christian; Eckerle, Isabella","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fdea1d57d5d3d0ee393379c8437b0393f0ce542.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4855710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142375/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0531-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["established cell lines","renal epithelial cell lines","kidney epithelial cell lines","Continuous cell lines","culture of airway epithelial cell lines","virus isolation","investigation of virus","epithelial properties","vesicular stomatitis virus","West Nile virus","tick-borne encephalitis virus","members of zoonotic Bunya","zoonotic pathogens","Rhabdo","novel arthropod-derived viruses","relevant host species","assessment of zoonotic viruses","host-specific","host interactions","production of infectious virus particles","novel arthropod-derived members","reservoirs of novel","novel tools","families Bunya","Viral infection assays","relevant host context","viral infection experiments","wild cotton rats","particular Rift Valley fever virus","VSV","high-titre viral replication of RVFV","generation of rodent airway","WNV","human viruses","bats","Mesoniviridae families","TBEV","New World rodent species","unique susceptibility","model systems","interferon competence","interferon-competent","experimental animal model","long-standing history","Sigmodon hispidus","Flaviviridae","date","models","Small mammals","rodents","large variety","BACKGROUND","current study","CONCLUSION","METHODS","Cells","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

According to one estimate, 25% of the commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants. Several plants could offer a rich reserve for drug discovery of infectious diseases, particularly in an era when the latest separation techniques are available on one hand, and the human population is challenged by a number of emerging infectious diseases on the other hand. Among several other ailments, viral infections, particularly infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and 2 (HIV-2), and newly emerging infectious viruses have challenged mankind survival. Of importance, a variety of medicinal plants have shown promise to treat a number of viral infections, and some of them possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In the past, exploration into the antiviral activity of various promising medicinal plants was limited due to: (a) highly infectious nature of viruses and (b) lack of appropriate separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components from plants. Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus could be used for antiviral screening purposes, and advancement in separation technologies offers promise for medicinal plants usage in modern drug discovery.

The initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies of lactogenic immunity to TGEV in swine. These studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent TGEV stimulated high titers of SIgA antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against TGE; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed TGEV vaccines induced mainly IgG antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs. The recent appearance of PRCV infections in swine and continuing studies of TGEV infections, present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity. Research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions. Although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for TGEV is the stimulation of GALT through intestinal virus replication, studies addressing the contribution of BALT to immunity to TGEV and PRCV may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches. The mechanism by which exposure to PRCV elicits a variable degree of immunity to TGEV challenge is unknown. Virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites, i.e., GALT to BALT and BALT to GALT migration. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of IgM-, IgG- and IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and T lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against TGEV challenge.","publish_time":"1994-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saif, L.

The screen revealed a high-score interaction with cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle early G(1) phase. M2-cyclin D3 interaction was validated through GST pull-down and recapitulated in influenza A/WSN/33-infected cells. Knockdown of Ccnd3 by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced virus progeny titers in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, the increase in virus production was due to cyclin D3 deficiency per se and not merely a consequence of cell cycle deregulation. A combined knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1, which rescued cell cycle progression into S phase, failed to normalize virus production. Infection by influenza A virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2 with M1, which is essential for proper assembly of progeny virions, lending further support to its role as a putative restriction factor. Our study describes the identification and characterization of cyclin D3 as a novel interactor of influenza A virus M2 protein. We hypothesize that competitive inhibition of M1-M2 interaction by cyclin D3 impairs infectious virion formation and results in attenuated virus production. In addition, we provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay of influenza virus with the host cell cycle machinery during infection.","publish_time":"2017-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Ying; Mok, Chris Ka-Pun; Chan, Michael Chi Wai; Zhang, Yang; Nal, B\u00E9atrice; Kien, Fran\u00E7ois; Bruzzone, Roberto; Sanyal, Sumana","journal":"J Biol Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e34c8495ee4de8e0607b48585b97fa0c0da9dc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5377818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130444/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m117.776112","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST","RNA","HEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M2-cyclin D3 interaction","characterization of cyclin D3","cyclin D3 deficiency","virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3","virus M2 protein","cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2","attenuated virus production","dynamic interplay of influenza virus","M2 interaction","cell cycle progression","enhanced virus progeny titers","host cell cycle machinery","replication of influenza","consequence of cell cycle deregulation","cell culture supernatants","novel interactor of influenza","key regulator of cell cycle early G","Infection","high-score interaction","combined knockdown of Ccnd3","T cells","S phase","hybrid screen","infected cells","competitive inhibition of M1","new host factors","proper assembly of progeny virions","cytoplasmic tail of matrix protein","infectious virion formation","small interfering RNA","results","Rb1","mechanistic insights","GST pull-down","role","support","identification","nucleus","HEK","putative restriction factor","pathogenic H5N1 strain","WSN","yeast","proteasomal degradation","addition","study","increase"],"language":"en"},

However, the clinical manifestations of RSV and hMPV infections are similar. Therefore, a reliable and rapid diagnostic tool is needed for diagnostic performance. METHODS: In order to optimize diagnosis efficiency of RTI, the aim of this study is to establish a rapid and advanced method for simultaneous detecting RSV and hMPV in nasopharyngeal aspirates specimens from patients. We designed a one-step triplex real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) protocol using TaqMan probes for detecting RSV and hMPV. The plasmid clones containing RSV nucleoprotein gene and hMPV fusion gene were established as reference standards. We used virus culture supernatants from 86 known pediatric RTI patient to test the specificity and sensitivity of our assay. Then we used total 222 nasopharyngeal aspirates specimens from pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms to evaluate our assay. RESULTS: Our one-step triplex qRT-PCR assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in testing RSV and hMPV in 86 known virus culture supernatants, with excellent linearity (R(2) \u003E 0.99) and reliable reproducibility (CV lower than 1.04%). This assay has a wide dynamic range 10(2)-10(9)copies/reaction (limit of detection; LOD = 100 copies/reaction). A total of 222 patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms were enrolled for clinical evaluation. In these samples, our qRT-PCR assay detected 68 RSV positive and 18 hMPV positive cases. However, standard virus culture only detected 8 RSV positive cases and 0 hMPV cases. Based on this improved triplex qRT-PCR assay, we found that RSV infection was associated with severe inflammation by chest X-ray and occurrence of pneumonia which were not observed previously. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have developed a highly specific and sensitive one-step triplex qRT-PCR assay to detect hMPV and RSV simultaneously. This assay offers a valuable tool for routine diagnosis.","publish_time":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"You, Huey-Ling; Chang, Shun-Jen; Yu, Hong-Ren; Li, Chia-Chin; Chen, Chang-Han; Liao, Wei-Ting","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aebf3e6b69b0563ab38d9d973db9a7795f75f47e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5368990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347279/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-017-0843-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","LOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","hMPV cases","testing RSV","RSV positive cases","hMPV infections","hMPV positive cases","improved triplex qRT-PCR assay","sensitive one-step triplex qRT-PCR assay","RSV nucleoprotein gene","simultaneous detecting RSV","clinical manifestations of RSV","hMPV fusion gene","one-step triplex real-time RT-PCR","respiratory syncytial virus","pediatric patients","respiratory symptoms","known virus culture supernatants","standard virus culture","respiratory tract infection","pediatric RTI patient","nasopharyngeal aspirates specimens","specificity","diagnosis efficiency of RTI","rapid diagnostic tool","pediatric population","sensitivity","copies","reaction","total","valuable tool","routine diagnosis","diagnostic performance","clinical evaluation","reliable reproducibility","important viral pathogens","severe inflammation","human metapneumovirus","protocol","excellent linearity","advanced method","TaqMan probes","chest X-ray","LOD","limit of detection","plasmid clones","occurrence of pneumonia","order","aim","reference standards","CV lower","study","wide dynamic range","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","samples","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","summary"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, exosomes have emerged as novel drug and gene delivery tools owing to their multiple advantages over conventional delivery systems. Recently, increasing attention has been focused on exosomes for the delivery of drugs, including therapeutic recombinant proteins, to various target tissues. Exosomes are also promising vehicles for the delivery of microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, which is usually hampered by rapid degradation of these RNAs, as well as inefficient tissue specificity of currently available delivery strategies.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Methods We enrolled 325 children aged \u003C 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B21 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P = .0001) and IL-10 (P = .006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0\u003C age \u22646 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12\u003C age \u003C24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P = .012 and P = .005, respectively).

This study aimed to review cases of MERS-related events, such as development of MERS-like symptoms or exposure to patients. Methods A MERS screening clinic (MSC) for HCP was setup in the National Medical Center during the MERS outbreak in 2015. Clinical and laboratory data from HCP who visited the MSC were retrospectively reviewed. Additionally, these data were compared with the results of postoutbreak questionnaire surveys and interviews about MERS-related symptoms and risk-related events. Results Of the 333 HCP who participated in MERS patient care, 35 HCP (10.5%) visited the MSC for MERS-like symptoms. No one was infected with MERS, and the most common symptom was fever (68.6%) followed by cough (34.3%). However, 106 of 285 postoutbreak survey participants experienced at least 1 MERS-related symptom and 26 reported exposure to patients without appropriate personal protective equipment, whereas only 4 HCP visited the MSC to report exposure events. Conclusions Although a considerable number of HCP experienced MERS-related symptoms or unprotected exposure during MERS patient care, some did not take appropriate action. These findings imply that for infection control strategy to be properly performed, education should be strengthened so that HCP can accurately recognize the risk situation and properly notify the infection control officer.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ji Yeon; Kim, Gayeon; Lim, Dong-Gyun; Jee, Hyeon-Gun; Jang, Yunyoung; Joh, Joon-Sung; Jeong, Ina; Kim, Yeonjae; Kim, Eunhee; Chin, Bum Sik","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132669.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655317310921; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2017.09.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153641/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317310921","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCP","National Medical Center","MERS","MSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS outbreak","cases of MERS","development of MERS","MERS patient care","considerable number of HCP experienced MERS-related symptoms","MERS screening clinic","MSC","exposure events","risk-related events","unprotected exposure","reported exposure","patients","health care personnel","infection control strategy","infection control officer","results of postoutbreak questionnaire surveys","risk situation","common symptom","appropriate action","laboratory data","postoutbreak survey participants","appropriate personal protective equipment","interviews","Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome","National Medical Center","setup","Methods","findings","Conclusions","major concern","fever","education","study","cough"],"language":"en"},

Treatments using natural-product nanomaterials are a promising technique because of their relatively low toxicity compared to inorganic nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes. In this study, antimicrobial filters were fabricated from natural Euscaphis japonica nanoparticles, which were produced by nebulizing E. japonica extract. The coated filters were assessed in terms of pressure drop, antimicrobial activity, filtration efficiency, major chemical components, and cytotoxicity. Pressure drop and antimicrobial activity increased as a function of nanoparticle deposition time (590, 855, and 1150 \u00B5g/cm2(filter) at 3-, 6-, and 9-min depositions, respectively). In filter tests, the antimicrobial efficacy was greater against Staphylococcus epidermidis than Micrococcus luteus; ~61, ~73, and ~82% of M. luteus cells were inactivated on filters that had been coated for 3, 6, and 9 min, respectively, while the corresponding values were ~78, ~88, and ~94% with S. epidermidis. Although statistically significant differences in filtration performance were not observed between samples as a function of deposition time, the average filtration efficacy was slightly higher for S. epidermidis aerosols (~97%) than for M. luteus aerosols (~95%). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) analyses confirmed that the major chemical compounds in the E. japonica extract were 1(\u00DF)-O-galloyl pedunculagin, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside. In vitro cytotoxicity and disk diffusion tests showed that E. japonica nanoparticles were less toxic and exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity toward some bacterial strains than a reference soluble nickel compound, which is classified as a human carcinogen.

Aim To present and analyze the diagnostic capabilities of transthoracic ultrasonography in invasive pulmonary mucormycosis. Case study We present a case involving a 41-year-old female patient with pneumonia complicated by multisystem organ failure, who was diagnosed with invasive pulmonary mucormycosis. Results and discussion Transthoracic ultrasonography (TUS) revealed a consolidation area of heterogeneous echostructure with an abnormal air bronchogram, possibly suggestive of an invasive pulmonary fungal disorder. The presence of lesions observed with TUS was confirmed by computed tomography (CT). The final diagnosis of mucormycosis was possible after Mucor species fungi were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage culture. Conclusions (1) TUS is a widely available and inexpensive diagnostic method that is characterized by the absence of adverse effects, and its applicability in the diagnosis of pulmonary disorders other than invasive fungal infections is well documented. (2) Ultrasonographic analysis of lesions facilitates differentiation between bacterial and fungal pneumonia, and the high sensitivity and specificity of the procedure compared to CT scans as a reference method supports the reliability of ultrasound scans in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). (3) The use of TUS in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary mucormycosis appears warranted, particularly in cases when it is impossible to obtain a proven diagnosis.

Methods In 2008, the Department of Veterans Affairs formed the Project Better Respiratory Equipment using Advanced Technologies for Healthcare Employees (BREATHE) Working Group, composed of a variety of federal stakeholders, to discuss strategies for improving respirator compliance, including the need for more comfortable respirators. Results The Working Group developed 28 desirable performance characteristics that can be grouped into 4 key themes: (1) respirators should perform their intended function safely and effectively; (2) respirators should support, not interfere, with occupational activities; (3) respirators should be comfortable and tolerable for the duration of wear; and (4) respiratory protective programs should comply with federal/state standards and guidelines and local policies. As a necessary next step, the Working Group identified the need for a new class of respirators, to be called \u201CB95,\u201D which would better address the unique needs of health care personnel. Conclusion This article summarizes the outputs of the Project BREATHE Working Group and provides a national strategy to develop clinically validated respirator test methods, to promulgate B95 respirator standards, and to invent novel design features, which together will lead to commercialized B95 respirators.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gosch, Megan E.; Shaffer, Ronald E.; Eagan, Aaron E.; Roberge, Raymond J.; Davey, Victoria J.; Radonovich, Lewis J.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/517ede99b17b09eda6a84893b3c7105eb5f0b89f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115300.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2013.03.293; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655313005919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23726655/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655313005919","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Advanced Technologies","Working Group","Project BREATHE Working Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Working Group","comfortable respirators","commercialized B95 respirators","respirator compliance","B95 respirator standards","new class of respirators","Respiratory Equipment","Project","user compliance","validated respirator test methods","Background Respiratory protection","respiratory protective programs","unique needs of health care personnel","state standards","variety of federal stakeholders","Advanced Technologies","Healthcare Employees","national strategy","guidelines","outputs","Department of Veterans Affairs","local policies","desirable performance characteristics","strategies","article","novel design features","duration of wear","step","Conclusion","key themes","intended function","occupational activities"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The retrospective study was performed including a total of 37 post-SARS ONFH patients (66 hip joints) in the Department of Orthopedics of the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between November 2003 and November 2015, consisting of 6 males (11 hip joints) and 31 females (55 hip joints), with age between 19 and 47 years (average 29.9 years). Visual analog scale (VAS) score, Harris score and Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stage of imaging examination were compared among those before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 years after treatment. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis of VAS and Harris score before and after treatment. Difference of effective rate on all stages was analyzed with Chi-square test. RESULTS: With 12-year follow-up, significant improvements on VAS (6.81 of pre-treatment vs 3.94 of 12-year post-treatment) and Harris score (74.54 of pre-treatment vs 80.14 of 12-year post-treatment) were observed (all p\u003C0.05).

Methods Clinical follow-up, adherence to preventive measures and qPCR-based respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens carriage pre- and post-Magal, were assessed. Results 110 pilgrims from South Senegal were included. The duration of stay in Touba was 3 days. 41.8% and 14.5% pilgrims reported respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most individuals having the onset of symptoms during their stay in Touba, or soon after returning. The acquisition of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and adenovirus was 13.0, 16.7 and 4.6% respectively and that of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae was 3.7% and 26.9%. Acquisition of gastrointestinal viruses and parasites was low, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 2.2% for Campylobacter jejuni to 33.0% for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Conclusion This preliminary study confirms that Grand Magal pilgrims are likely to be exposed to communicable disease risk as observed in other pilgrimage settings.

Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuels inevitably generates air pollutants including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and others. Combining with other anthropogenic air pollutants, visibility in many Asian cities including Hong Kong have deteriorated rapidly in the past decades. This paper explores the relationships between energy use, meteorological factors, and change in visibility in Hong Kong using long-term time-series data. The total use of primary energy increased from 146,700 TJ in 1971 to 1,270,865 TJ in 2011 while the number of hours of reduced visibility increased from 184 h to 1398 h during the same period of time. Bivariate correlations show that poor visibility was significantly associated with energy use and annual mean air temperature. Multiple regression analysis indicates that the burning of aviation gasoline significantly, adversely affect visibility. Results illustrate that the number of clear days in Hong Kong will decrease, in particular due to the increase in air traffic.","publish_time":"2014-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, W.

Although acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated anaphylaxis and sepsis, and transfusion-associated acute lung injury occur infrequently, diligence in administration of blood and monitoring for development of respective signs/symptoms can minimize the severity of these potentially life-threatening complications. In addition, emerging blood-banking techniques such as psoralen-UV inactivation of pathogens and use of patient identification systems may attenuate the incidence of adverse events related to transfusion.

The shared versus specific role of these mechanisms across the three treatments will be evaluated during treatment (Primary Aim), and immediately post-treatment to examine relapse mechanisms (Secondary Aim). We will enroll 300 individuals with chronic pain (with low back pain as a primary or secondary condition), with 240 projected to complete the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to eight, 1.5 h telehealth group sessions of CT, MM, or AS. Mechanisms and outcomes will be assessed twice daily during 2-week baseline, 4-week treatment period, and 4-week post-treatment epoch via random cue-elicited ecological momentary assessment (EMA); activity level will be monitored during these time epochs via daily monitoring with ActiGraph technology. The primary outcome will be measured by the PROMIS 5-item Pain Interference scale. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to test the primary aims. This study is pre-registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03687762). This study will determine the temporal sequence of lagged mediation effects to evaluate rates of change in outcome as a function of change in mediators. The findings will provide an empirical basis for enhancing and streamlining psychosocial chronic pain interventions. Further, results will guide future efforts towards optimizing maintenance of gains to effectively reduce relapse risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Day, M.A.; Ehde, D.M.; Burns, J.; Ward, L.C.; Friedly, J.L.; Thorn, B.E.; Ciol, M.A.; Mendoza, E.; Chan, J.F.; Battalio, S.; Borckardt, J.; Jensen, M.P.","journal":"Contemp Clin Trials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b5c2c6c245d7705b5fcb1cd2a533b1147140be5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195020.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2020.106000; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714420300781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302791/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551714420300781","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PROMIS","clinicaltrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary outcome","chronic pain treatments","treatment improvement","treatment changes","week treatment period","week post-treatment epoch","relapse mechanisms","primary aims","study","psychosocial chronic pain interventions","item Pain Interference scale","cognitive therapy","cognitive process","cognitive content","week baseline","Secondary Aim","activity level","rates of change","function of change","secondary condition","daily monitoring","relapse risk","h telehealth group sessions of CT","random cue","ecological momentary assessment","temporal sequence of lagged mediation effects","time epochs","EMA","PROMIS","maintenance of gains","ActiGraph technology","future efforts","mindfulness meditation","empirical basis","Structural equation modeling","SEM","Identifier","specific role","individuals","NCT03687762","findings","results","mediators","randomized trial","extent","activation skills","outcomes","Participants"],"language":"en"},

We found that the IFN-\u03B2 production was significantly suppressed during PEDV infection in cells. To identify viral IFN antagonists and to study their suppressive function, viral coding sequences for the entire structural and nonstructural proteins were cloned and expressed. Of 16 PEDV nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp1, nsp3, nsp7, nsp14, nsp15 and nsp16 were found to inhibit the IFN-\u03B2 and IRF3 promoter activities. The sole accessory protein ORF3, structure protein envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein were also shown to inhibit such activities. PEDV nsp1 did not interfere the IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation but interrupted the enhanceosome assembly of IRF3 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) by degrading CBP. A further study showed that the CBP degradation by nsp1 was proteasome-dependent.

Previous studies suggested dromedary camels were a reservoir for this virus. We tested for the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar linked to two human cases of the infection in October, 2013. Methods We took nose swabs, rectal swabs, and blood samples from all camels on the Qatari farm. We tested swabs with RT-PCR, with amplification targeting the E gene (upE), nucleocapsid (N) gene, and open reading frame (ORF) 1a. PCR positive samples were tested by different MERS-CoV specific PCRs and obtained sequences were used for phylogentic analysis together with sequences from the linked human cases and other human cases. We tested serum samples from the camels for IgG immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, and virus neutralisation assay. Findings We obtained samples from 14 camels on Oct 17, 2013. We detected MERS-CoV in nose swabs from three camels by three independent RT-PCRs and sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of an ORF1a fragment (940 nucleotides) and a 4\u00B72 kb concatenated fragment were very similar to the MERS-CoV from two human cases on the same farm and a MERS-CoV isolate from Hafr-Al-Batin. Eight additional camel nose swabs were positive on one or more RT-PCRs, but could not be confirmed by sequencing. All camels had MERS-CoV spike-binding antibodies that correlated well with the presence of neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV. Interpretation Our study provides virological confirmation of MERS-CoV in camels and suggests a recent outbreak affecting both human beings and camels. We cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa, or if a third source was responsible.

Two patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of at least grade II. One had chronic GVHD and died \u003E1 year after HSCT of unknown causes. With a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 11 to 29), 7 patients (87.5%) are alive. Our findings suggest that limited insurance coverage, high rate of DSAs, and patient declining HSCT may limit the availability of haploidentical HSCT in adult SCD patients. The modified Hopkins regimen used here demonstrates high engraftment and low morbidity rates and should be tested in larger, multicenter, prospective clinical trials.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saraf, Santosh L.; Oh, Annie L.; Patel, Pritesh R.; Sweiss, Karen; Koshy, Matthew; Campbell-Lee, Sally; Gowhari, Michel; Jain, Shivi; Peace, David; Quigley, John G.; Khan, Irum; Molokie, Robert E.; Mahmud, Nadim; Gordeuk, Victor R.; Rondelli, Damiano","journal":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/720fe0404ede2c172f64654770169288f01bd3fa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/200b85eea010e695ac7281e5b8758c9fbbd6d0ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6108914.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656137/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.03.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S108387911830185X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S108387911830185X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","TBI","Johns Hopkins University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adult patients","adult SCD patients","availability of haploidentical HSCT","year post-HSCT","patient declining HSCT","HSCT of unknown causes","donor cell chimerism","available haploidentical donor","Gy","TBI","range","development of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","aggressive sickle cell disease","high rate of DSAs","modified Hopkins regimen","high engraftment","host disease","elevated donor-specific antibodies","median follow-up","median time","acute graft","chronic GVHD","Johns Hopkins University","limited insurance coverage","post-transplant cyclophosphamide","peripheral blood stem cells","alemtuzumab","total body irradiation","low morbidity rates","prospective clinical trials","screening","factor","findings","months","Granulocyte colony","neutrophil","institution","HbS","days"],"language":"en"},

Vaccine against Rinderpest Virus was developed by Koch in 1897 by administering bile from infected cattle. Animals that survived were permanently immune. Formalin- and chloroform-inactivated vaccines were developed using tissues from the infected animals. For the control of Newcastle disease, a number of attenuated live-virus vaccines have been developed which are widely used to control the disease. The Bl strain, the LaSota strain, and the F strain are used to immunize birds of all ages by different routes, including by addition to drinking water and by spraying.

Aim To investigate HCWs\u0027 contacts during a work day and compare these against working adults from the general population. Methods Prospective survey of contacts through 24 h self-reported diary in three public sector tertiary care hospitals and community-based working adults in Singapore. Participants were HCWs and working adults from the community. Findings In all, 211 HCWs and 1028 working adults reported a total of 4066 and 9206 contacts. HCWs reported more work-related contacts than community-based working adults (median of 13 versus 4), and more contacts that were neither household nor work-related (1 versus 0) but fewer household contacts (2 versus 3). HCWs reported more work-related contacts involving physical contacts, and more new contacts particularly with short duration (\u226415 min) compared to community-based working adults. Among different HCW types, doctors reported the highest whereas ward-based nurses reported the lowest total work-related contacts. Around half of ward-based and clinic-based nurses\u0027 contacts involved physical touch. Work-related contacts reported by clinic-based nurses, doctors, and assorted HCWs were shorter than in ward-based nurses, with a substantial number effectively occurring with new contacts. Institutional effects significant on univariate analyses were much reduced and non-significant after adjusting for confounding by HCW type. Conclusion HCWs\u0027 contacts differ substantially from those of community-based working adults. HCWs may thus be at higher risk of acquiring and spreading contact-transmissible and respiratory infections due to the nature of their work. Whereas total number of contacts was fairly similar between HCW types, the characteristics of their contacts differed substantively.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Lili; Ng, Isabel Hui Leng; Hou, Yan\u0027an; Li, Dunli; Tan, Linda Wei Lin; Ho, Hanley Jian An; Chen, Mark I-Cheng","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/473c721f42096f1b8450c669b607486841a5f72a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114670.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019567011730587X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097147/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2017.10.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019567011730587X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Healthcare","HCW"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["physical contacts","new contacts","total number of contacts","clinic-based nurses\u0027 contacts","working adults","fewer household contacts","lowest total work-related contacts","community","assorted HCWs","ward-based nurses","Conclusion HCWs","Methods Prospective survey of contacts","h self-reported diary","doctors","different HCW types","half of ward","healthcare setting","physical touch","substantial number","work day","Institutional effects significant","Summary Background Healthcare workers","public sector tertiary care hospitals","univariate analyses","respiratory infections","contact-transmissible","confounding","infectious diseases transmission","inadvertent interface","characteristics","nature","higher risk","short duration","general population","Singapore","median","Participants","Findings"],"language":"en"},

One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%. This study indicates the role of IBVs in the respiratory disorders of broiler flocks located in southwest Iran, and also the existence of a variant of IBV, which is distinguishable from the other Iranian variants.","publish_time":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boroomand, Zahra; Jafari, Ramezan Ali; Mayahi, Mansour","journal":"Vet Res Forum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/616cdd0a8b488fcf0b28781f710cc7fba8625a4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6198162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357063/; https://doi.org/10.30466/vrf.2018.32089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB","IBV"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["QX","IBV isolates","respiratory disease","respiratory disorders of broiler flocks","JS","examined flocks","gene of IBV","variant of IBV","respiratory symptoms","southwest Iran","Iranian broiler chickens","upper respiratory tract","role of IBVs","SGK","study","RT-PCR products","emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses","contagious disease","Iranian variants","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","liver","significant economic losses","diseased birds","kidney","HC10","GX","HC9","NN11","YC11","ceacal tonsil","spike","trachea","lung","poultry industry","Harvested allantoic fluids","primers","S1","Iraq","existence","China","chicken embryonated eggs","specimens","PCRLab","Ahwaz","major concerns","nucleotide homology","phylogenetic analysis","results","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, estimation of unreported infections is crucial for a better understanding of the current emergency in China and in other countries. In this study, we aimed to estimate the unreported number of infections in China prior to the 23 January 2020 restrictions. To do this, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model that estimated unreported infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by ascertainment biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.43 (95%CI = 2.42-2.44) at the beginning of the epidemic and that 92.9% (95%CI = 92.5%-93.1%) of total cases were not reported. Similarly, the proportion of unreported new infections by day ranged from 52.1% to 100%, with a total of 91.8% (95%CI = 91.6%-92.1%) of infections going unreported. Agreement between our estimates and those from previous studies proves that our approach is reliable for estimating the prevalence and incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections. Once it has been tested on Chinese data, our model could be applied to other countries with different surveillance and testing policies.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maugeri, Andrea; Barchitta, Martina; Battiato, Sebastiano; Agodi, Antonella","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["unreported number of infections","estimation of unreported infections","proportion of unreported new infections","reported number of deaths","reported case data","China","countries","model","epidemic","approach","basic reproductive number","incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV","Chinese data","total cases","better understanding","prevalence","SEIRD","current emergency","biased speculations","different surveillance","testing policies","novel coronavirus","day","previous studies","estimates","Dead","midst","R0","fact","ascertainment biases","conclusions","Agreement","beginning","restrictions","study"],"language":"en"},

Here, our objective was to determine whether EriCoV is present, and if it is associated with disease, in Great Britain (GB). An EriCoV-specific BRYT-Green(\u00AE) real-time reverse transcription PCR assay was used to test 351 samples of faeces or distal large intestinal tract contents collected from casualty or dead hedgehogs from a wide area across GB. Viral RNA was detected in 10.8% (38) samples; however, the virus was not detected in any of the 61 samples tested from Scotland. The full genome sequence of the British EriCoV strain was determined using next generation sequencing; it shared 94% identity with a German EriCoV sequence. Multivariate statistical models using hedgehog case history data, faecal specimen descriptions and post-mortem examination findings found no significant associations indicative of disease associated with EriCoV in hedgehogs. These findings indicate that the Western European hedgehog is a reservoir host of EriCoV in the absence of apparent disease.","publish_time":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saldanha, I.

Nsp13 is among the evolutionary most conserved proteins not only in CoVs but also in nidovirales. Thus, it is considered as an important drug target. However, the high-resolution structure of CoV nsp13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, which hindered the structure-based drug design. This is in part due to the intrinsic flexibility of nsp13. Here, we describe protocols of deducing the crystal structure of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) helicase in detail, which include protein expression, purification, crystallization, enzymatic characterization, and structure determination.

METHODS: We constructed and characterized two recombinant baculoviruses carrying the expression cassette for the H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene driven by either an insect cell promoter (vAc-HA) or a dual-promoter active both in insect and mammalian cells (vAc-HA-DUAL). Virus without the HA gene (vAc-EGFP) was used as a control. These viruses were used to immunize mice subcutaneously and intraperitoneally. The production of total and specific antibodies was determined by ELISA and competitive ELISA. Cytokine production by the spleen cells of immunized mice was studied using the ELISPOT assay. RESULTS: Both the vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL vectors expressed HA proteins in insect Sf9 cells, and HA antigen was present in progeny virions. The vAc-HA-DUAL vector also mediated HA expression in virus-transduced mammalian cell lines (BHK and A547). Both vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL exhibited higher transduction efficiencies than vAc-EGFP in mammalian cells, as shown by the expression of the reporter gene egfp. Additionally, both vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL induced high levels of HA-specific antibody production in immunized mice; vAc-HA-DUAL was more efficient in inducing IFN-\u03B3 and IL-2 upon stimulation with specific antigen, whereas vAc-HA was more efficient in inducing IL-4 and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Baculovirus vectors elicited efficient, specific immune responses in immunized mice. The vector displaying the HA antigen on the virion surface (vAc-HA) elicited a Th2-biased immune response, whereas the vector displaying HA and mediating HA expression in the cell (vAc-HA-DUAL) elicited a Th1-biased immune response.","publish_time":"2012-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Zhi-peng; Yin, Juan; Zhang, Yuan-yuan; Jia, Shu-ya; Chen, Zuo-jia; Zhong, Jiang","journal":"Acta Pharmacologica Sinica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e703edd77ac83d7415010ec8c6d483f6f5e80e22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4010374.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/aps.2012.23; https://www.nature.com/articles/aps201223.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22562016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vAc-HA","HA antigen","HA gene","HA proteins","mediating HA expression","vAc-EGFP","DUAL induced high levels of HA","DUAL vectors","specific antigen","specific immune responses","dual-promoter active","mammalian cells","spleen cells of immunized mice","specific antibodies","specific antibody production","insect Sf9 cells","insect cell promoter","expression cassette","inducing IL","DUAL exhibited higher transduction efficiencies","reporter gene egfp","Th1-biased immune response","Th2-biased immune response","virus-transduced mammalian cell lines","different baculovirus vectors","Cytokine production","production of total","H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin","competitive ELISA","inducing IFN-\u03B3","BHK","stimulation","virion surface","A547","progeny virions","recombinant baculoviruses","CONCLUSION","ELISPOT assay","AIM","RESULTS","control","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

BVs are commonly described as rod shaped particles with a high apical density of protein extensions (spikes) on the lipid envelope surface. However, due to the fragility of BVs the conventional purification and electron microscopy (EM) staining methods considerably distort the native viral structure. Here, we use cryo-EM analysis to reveal the near-native morphology of two intensively studied baculoviruses, Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Spodoptera exigua MNPV (SeMNPV), as models for BVs carrying GP64 and F as envelope fusion protein on the surface. The now well-preserved AcMNPV and SeMNPV BV particles have a remarkable elongated, ovoid shape leaving a large, lateral space between nucleocapsid (NC) and envelope. Consistent with previous findings the NC has a distinctive cap and base structure interacting tightly with the envelope. This tight interaction may explain the partial retaining of the envelope on both ends of the NC and the disappearance of the remainder of the BV envelope in the negative-staining EM images. Cryo-EM also reveals that the viral envelope contains two layers with a total thickness of \u22486\u20137nm, which is significantly thicker than a usual biological membrane (\u003C4nm) as measured by X-ray scanning. Most spikes are densely clustered at the two apical ends of the virion although some envelope proteins are also found more sparsely on the lateral regions. The spikes on the surface of AcMNPV BVs appear distinctly different from those of SeMNPV. Based on our observations we propose a new near-native structural model of baculovirus BVs.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qiushi; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Vlak, Just M.; van Oers, Monique M.; Rottier, Peter J.; van Lent, Jan W.M.","journal":"Journal of Invertebrate Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1038bb44c06e9429393d9a40c07b53d2baf850c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127228.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022201115300434; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201115300434; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SeMNPV BV","NC"],"locations":["BV"],"keyphrases":["BV envelope","viral envelope","envelope proteins","lipid envelope surface","surface of AcMNPV BVs","envelope fusion protein","fragility of BVs","spikes","SeMNPV BV particles","native viral structure","cryo-EM analysis","native structural model of baculovirus BVs","well-preserved AcMNPV","negative-staining EM images","apical ends","nm","near-native morphology","staining methods","Abstract Baculoviruses","lateral space","base structure","lateral regions","high apical density of protein extensions","rod shaped particles","electron microscopy","double-stranded DNA insect viruses","group of enveloped","ovoid shape","conventional purification","GP64","Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus","distinctive cap","Spodoptera exigua MNPV","models","nucleocapsid","previous findings","virions","usual biological membrane","occlusion","partial retaining","layers","remainder","ODV","tight interaction","total thickness","disappearance","infection cycle","X-ray scanning","observations"],"language":"en"},

Using population-level data, we report the secular trend of the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2015. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Hong Kong Diabetes Surveillance Database hosts clinical information on people with diabetes receiving care under the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, a statutory body that governs all public hospitals and clinics. Sex-specific incidence rates were standardised to the age structure of the World Health Organization population. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to describe incidence trends. A total of 562,022 cases of incident diabetes (type 1 diabetes [n = 2,426]: mean age at diagnosis is 32.5 years, 48.4% men; type 2 diabetes [n = 559,596]: mean age at diagnosis is 61.8 years, 51.9% men) were included. Among people aged \u003C20 years, incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increased. For type 1 diabetes, the incidence increased from 3.5 (95% CI 2.2\u20134.9) to 5.3 (95% CI 3.4\u20137.1) per 100,000 person-years (average annual percentage change [AAPC] 3.6% [95% CI 0.2\u20137.1], p \u003C 0.05) in boys and from 4.3 (95% CI 2.7\u20135.8) to 6.4 (95% CI 4.3\u20138.4) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.7% [95% CI 1.7\u20137.7], p \u003C 0.05] in girls; for type 2 diabetes, the incidence increased from 4.6 (95% CI 3.2\u20136.0) to 7.5 (95% CI 5.5\u20139.6) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 5.9% [95% CI 3.4\u20138.5], p \u003C 0.05) in boys and from 5.9 (95% CI 4.3\u20137.6) to 8.5 (95% CI 6.2\u201310.8) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.8% [95% CI 2.7\u20137.0], p \u003C 0.05) in girls. In people aged 20 to \u003C40 years, incidence of type 1 diabetes remained stable, but incidence of type 2 diabetes increased over time from 75.4 (95% CI 70.1\u201380.7) to 110.8 (95% CI 104.1\u2013117.5) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.2% [95% CI 3.1\u20135.3], p \u003C 0.05) in men and from 45.0 (95% CI 41.4\u201348.6) to 62.1 (95% CI 57.8\u201366.3) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 3.3% [95% CI 2.3\u20134.2], p \u003C 0.05) in women. In people aged 40 to \u003C60 years, incidence of type 2 diabetes increased until 2011/2012 and then flattened. In people aged \u226560 years, incidence was stable in men and declined in women after 2011. No trend was identified in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in people aged \u226520 years. The present study is limited by its reliance on electronic medical records for identification of people with diabetes, which may result in incomplete capture of diabetes cases. The differentiation of type 1 and type 2 diabetes was based on an algorithm subject to potential misclassification. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in incidence of type 2 diabetes in people aged \u003C40 years and stabilisation in people aged \u226540 years. Incidence of type 1 diabetes continued to climb in people aged \u003C20 years but remained constant in other age groups.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luk, Andrea O.

The Wen Bing formulas, such as Yin-Qiao-San and Sang-Ju-Yin, are still first-line herbal therapies in combating variant influenza virus. To continue our study on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between Wen Bing formulas and oseltamivir (OS), the first-line western drug for the treatment of influenza, further interactions between OS and the eight single herbs and their relevant marker components from Wen Bing formulas were investigated in the current study. Aim of study To establish an in-vitro screening platform for investigation of the potential anti-influenza herbs/herbal components that may have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with OS. Materials and methods To screen potential inhibition on OS hydrolysis, 1 \u03BCg/mL of OS is incubated with herbs/herbal components in diluted rat plasma, microsomes and human recombinant carboxylesterase 1(hCE1) under optimized conditions. MDCK-WT and MDCK-MDR1 cell lines are utilized to identify potential modification on P-gp mediated transport of OS by herbs/herbal components. Caco-2 cells with and without Gly-Sar inhibition are performed to study the uptake of OS via PEPT1 transporters. Modification on OAT3 mediated transport is verified by the uptake of OS on HEK293-MOCK/HEK293-OAT3 cells. Anti-virus effects were evaluated using plaque reduction assay on H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between OS (30 mg/kg) and the selected herb, Radix Scutellariae (RS), at 300\u2013600 mg/kg were carried out on rats. All samples are analyzed by an LC/MS/MS method for the contents of OS and OSA. A mechanistic PK model was developed to interpret the HDI between OS and RS in rats. Results Our developed platform was successfully applied to screen the eight herbal extracts and their ten marker components on metabolic inhibition of OS and modification of OS transport mediated by P-gp, OAT3 and PEPT1. Results from six in-vitro experiments were analyzed after converting raw data from each experiment to corresponding fold-change (FC) values, based on which Radix Scutellariae (RS) were selected to have the most HDI potential with OS. By analyzing the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic data after co-administration of OS with a standardized RS extract in rats using an integrated population pharmacokinetics model, it is suggested that RS could inhibit OS hydrolysis during absorption and increase the absorbed fraction of OS, which leads to the increased ratio of OS concentration versus that of OSA in both rat plasma and urine. Never the less, the anti-virus effects of 2.5 h post-dose rat plasma were not influenced by co-administration of OS with RS. Conclusion A six-dimension in-vitro screening platform has been developed and successfully applied to find RS as a potential herb that would influence the co-administrated OS in rats. Although co-administered RS could inhibit OS hydrolysis during absorption and increase the absorbed fraction of OS, which lead to the increased ratio of OS concentration versus that of OSA in both rat plasma and urine, the anti-virus effect of OS was not influenced by co-administered RS.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yufeng; Lyu, Chunming; Fong, Sophia Yui Kau; Wang, Qian; Li, Chenrui; Ho, Nicolas James; Chan, Kay Sheung; Yan, Xiaoyu; Zuo, Zhong","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33e842f6dff3e6d350758e8ad5afec1bdde42f7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125811.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325600/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119301175; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119301175; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.112097","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wen Bing","Radix Scutellariae"],"organizations":["OSA","HDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OS hydrolysis","uptake of OS","contents of OS","co-administration of OS","modification of OS transport","co-administrated OS","metabolic inhibition of OS","absorbed fraction of OS","anti-virus effect of OS","increased ratio of OS concentration","P-gp mediated transport of OS","co-administered RS","herbal components","potential anti-influenza herbs","potential inhibition","potential modification","potential herb","HDI potential","rats","Wen Bing formulas","standardized RS extract","diluted rat plasma","Anti-virus effects","variant influenza virus","urine pharmacokinetic data","pharmacodynamic interactions","herbal extracts","OAT3 mediated transport","OSA","developed platform","relevant marker components","line herbal therapies","vitro screening platform","treatment of influenza","single herbs","current study","h post-dose rat plasma","HEK293-OAT3 cells","absorption","vitro experiments","Radix Scutellariae","selected herb","Results","Gly-Sar inhibition","HEK293-MOCK","MS method","raw data","MDCK-WT","Yin-Qiao","Ju-Yin","PEPT1 transporters","line western drug","mechanistic PK model","MDCK-MDR1 cell lines","integrated population pharmacokinetics model","microsomes","plaque reduction assay","investigation","human recombinant carboxylesterase","Traditional Chinese Medicine theory","hCE1","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","H1N1","values","oseltamivir","H3N2 viruses","fold-change","San","LC","dimension","warm disease","methods","\u03BCg","FC","Materials","optimized conditions","samples","Conclusion","Caco"],"language":"en"},

Numerous viruses have been shown to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a medically important human pathogen that causes acute and chronic hepatitis. In this study, we screened all the nonstructural proteins of HCV and found that HCV NS2 could suppress RNAi induced either by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that NS2 could suppress RNAi via its direct interaction with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and siRNAs, and further identified that the cysteine 184 of NS2 is required for the RNAi suppression activity through a serial of point mutation analyses. Together, our findings uncovered that HCV NS2 can act as a VSR in vitro, thereby providing novel insights into the life cycle and virus-host interactions of HCV.

The past two decades have revealed new functions for some of the intermediate products, beyond their roles as substrates along the classical route. They may be processed in alternative ways by enzymes such as the ACE homolog ACE2. One effect is to establish a second axis through ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MAS, whose end point is the metabolite ANG-(1\u20137). ACE2 and other enzymes can form ANG-(1\u20137) directly or indirectly from either the decapeptide ANG I or from ANG II.

In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [14C]leucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3, or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H] [14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin\u0027s oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Griffonia simplicifolia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a \u03B2-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin\u0027s oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with \u03B2-galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr, 8\u20139% of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2\u00B72% had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin\u0027s oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75% of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 25% was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.","publish_time":"1991-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Sylvia B.; St Jules, Robert S.; O\u0027Brien, Paul J.","journal":"Experimental Eye Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34fc903da6edb339a2c71ebfaacc2333dabf047c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/001448359190170J; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001448359190170J","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhodopsin","Griffonia"],"organizations":["RCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rhodopsin of discs","labeled rhodopsin","rat rhodopsin","rhodopsin standard","Separation of rhodopsin","subset of rhodopsin","galactose oxidase","association of galactose","addition of galactose","Decreased binding of rhodopsin","presence of existing molecules of galactose","Binding of rhodopsin\u0027s oligosaccharide","Abstract Rhodopsin\u0027s oligosaccharide chains","terminal sugar","subcellular fractionation of retinas","GSA","Rats","RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed","lectin affinity chromatography","additional lectin columns","ConA sepharose chromatography","types of sugar residues","Golgi-enriched fraction","intravitreal injection of castanospermine","inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming","possible role","plasma membranes","membrane assembly","\u03B2-galactosidase","\u03B2-galactoside","Treatment of bovine rod outer segments","Ricinus communis agglutinin","new disc formation","sodium borohydride","subsequent removal","mannose","reduction","tritium","Griffonia simplicifolia","SDS-PAGE","present work","fractions","pre-treatment","ratios","experiments","N-acetylglucosamine","isotope ratio","swainsonine","darkness","leucine","findings","transition","days","cent","neuraminic acid","methionine","data"],"language":"en"},

The practices in the Zhangjiakou FCB project offer a solution to the hydrogen economy, which helps to break the chicken-egg dilemma of vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Guoqiang; Zhang, Juan; Xie, Tian","journal":"Int J Hydrogen Energy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22857e95293e7b7f5a6c0e3ca3ce86cdf385dd74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322133/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360319920312386; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319920312386; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":["Zhangjiakou"],"keyphrases":["renewable hydrogen","hydrogen stations","hydrogen infrastructure","hydrogen production","hydrogen economy","localization of H","Fuel cell vehicles","profitability","pathway","curtailed end price of H","Zhangjiakou fuel cell transit bus project","Zhangjiakou FCB project","chicken-egg dilemma of vehicles","FCV commercialization","abundant renewable resources","life-cycle carbon-free option","water electrolysis","supply","areas","research","solution","transport sector","actual data","intense deployment","Low electricity","key issue","cost","Winter Olympics","chance","delivery","practices","fulfillment"],"language":"en"},

Yet, little is known on the role in the HCV life cycle of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), one of the most important kinases in cellular metabolism. Therefore, the impact of GSK3 on the HCV life cycle was assessed in human hepatoma cell lines harboring subgenomic genotype 1b and 2a replicons or producing cell culture-derived HCV genotype 2a by exposure to synthetic GSK3 inhibitors, GSK3 gene silencing, overexpression of GSK3 constructs and immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, the role of GSK3 in hepatitis E virus (HEV) replication was investigated to assess virus specificity of the observed findings. We found that both inhibition of GSK3 function by synthetic inhibitors as well as silencing of GSK3\u03B2 gene expression resulted in a decrease of HCV replication and infectious particle production, whereas silencing of the GSK3\u03B1 isoform had no relevant effect on the HCV life cycle. Conversely, overexpression of GSK3\u03B2 resulted in enhanced HCV replication. In contrast, GSK3\u03B2 had no effect on replication of subgenomic HEV replicon. The pro-viral effect of GSK3\u03B2 on HCV replication was mediated by supporting expression of microRNA-122 (miR-122), a micro-RNA which is mandatory for wild-type HCV replication, as GSK3 inhibitors suppressed miR-122 levels and as inhibitors of GSK3 had no antiviral effect on a miR-122-independent HCV mutant. In conclusion, we have identified GSK3\u03B2 is a novel host factor supporting HCV replication by maintaining high levels of hepatic miR-122 expression.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saleh, Maged; R\u00FCschenbaum, Sabrina; Welsch, Christoph; Zeuzem, Stefan; Moradpour, Darius; Gouttenoire, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Lange, Christian M.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80beb71c4b247cf32525097f28568b49f71cf08b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6278592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30542341/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02949","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["decrease of HCV replication","enhanced HCV replication","inhibitors of GSK3","role of GSK3","wild-type HCV replication","synthetic GSK3 inhibitors","impact of GSK3","GSK3 gene silencing","independent HCV mutant","overexpression of GSK3 constructs","HCV life cycle of glycogen synthase kinase","inhibition of GSK3 function","cell culture-derived HCV genotype","overexpression of GSK3\u03B2","silencing of GSK3\u03B2 gene expression","synthetic inhibitors","replication of subgenomic HEV replicon","pro-viral effect of GSK3\u03B2","relevant effect","antiviral effect","subgenomic genotype","hepatitis E virus","high levels of hepatic miR","Hepatitis C virus","virus specificity","expression of microRNA","host lipid","novel host factor","human hepatoma cell lines","exposure","infection","key molecules","infectious particle production","replicons","alterations","GSK3\u03B1 isoform","insulin","immunofluorescence analyses","micro-RNA","metabolic pathways","important kinases","cellular metabolism","cascades","observed findings","dependence","addition","contrast","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Strong associations have been demonstrated by epidemiological and toxicological studies between increases in PM(2.5) concentrations and premature mortality, cardiopulmonary diseases, asthma and allergic sensitization, and lung cancer. The mechanisms of PM-induced toxicological effects are related to their size, chemical composition, lung clearance and retention, cellular oxidative stress responses and pro-inflammatory effects locally and systemically. Particles in the ultrafine range (\u003C100 nm), although they have the highest number counts, surface area and organic chemical content, are often overlooked due to insufficient monitoring and risk assessment. Yet, ample studies have demonstrated that ambient ultrafine particles have higher toxic potential compared with PM(2.5). In addition, the rapid development of nanotechnology, bringing ever-increasing production of nanomaterials, has raised concerns about the potential human exposure and health impacts.

We explored a method for deriving thresholds proposed in an influenza surveillance manual published by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: For 2002-2011, we analysed two routine influenza-like-illness (ILI) datasets, general practice sentinel surveillance and a locum medical service sentinel surveillance, plus laboratory data and hospital admissions for influenza. For each sentinel dataset, we created two composite variables from the product of weekly ILI data and the relevant laboratory data, indicating the proportion of tested specimens that were positive. For all datasets, including the composite datasets, we aligned data on the median week of peak influenza or ILI activity and assigned three threshold levels: seasonal threshold, determined by inspection; and two intensity thresholds termed average and alert thresholds, determined by calculations of means, medians, confidence intervals (CI) and percentiles. From the thresholds, we compared the seasonal onset, end and intensity across all datasets from 2002-2011. Correlation between datasets was assessed using the mean correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The median week of peak activity was week 34 for all datasets, except hospital data (week 35). Means and medians were comparable and the 90% upper CIs were similar to the 95(th) percentiles. Comparison of thresholds revealed variations in defining the start of a season but good agreement in describing the end and intensity of influenza seasons, except in hospital admissions data after the pandemic year of 2009. The composite variables improved the agreements between the ILI and other datasets. Datasets were well correlated, with mean correlation coefficients of \u003E0.75 for a range of combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Thresholds for influenza surveillance are easily derived from historical surveillance and laboratory data using the approach proposed by WHO. Use of composite variables is helpful for describing influenza season characteristics.","publish_time":"2013-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tay, Ee Laine; Grant, Kristina; Kirk, Martyn; Mounts, Anthony; Kelly, Heath","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5143bcbf109f693de355d2512a5810ed93a3072a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3795663.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24146973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["composite datasets","hospital data","intensity thresholds","influenza surveillance manual","routine influenza","intensity of influenza seasons","hospital admissions data","median week of peak influenza","thresholds useful","alert thresholds","Comparison of thresholds","relevant laboratory data","severity of influenza seasons","influenza season characteristics","composite variables","product of weekly ILI data","historical surveillance","ILI activity","general practice sentinel surveillance","median week of peak activity","locum medical service sentinel surveillance","start","sentinel dataset","end","seasonal threshold","medians","mean correlation coefficients","percentiles","threshold levels","Health authorities","seasonal onset","calculations of means","World Health Organization","confidence intervals","illness","good agreement","proportion of tested specimens","INTRODUCTION","pandemic year","inspection","agreements","upper CIs","variations","RESULTS","approach","CONCLUSIONS","range of combinations","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data. The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion.

The long\u2010term ecological impact of pathogens on group\u2010living, large mammal populations is largely unknown. We evaluated the impact of a pathogenic bacterium, Streptococcus equi ruminatorum, and other key ecological factors on the dynamics of the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta population in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. 2. We compared key demographic parameters during two years when external signs of bacterial infection were prevalent (\u2018outbreak\u2019) and periods of five years before and after the outbreak when such signs were absent or rare. We also tested for density dependence and calculated the basic reproductive rate R (0) of the bacterium. 3. During the five pre\u2010outbreak years, the mean annual hyena mortality rate was 0\u00B7088, and annual population growth was relatively high (13\u00B76%). During the outbreak, mortality increased by 78% to a rate of 0\u00B7156, resulting in an annual population decline of 4\u00B73%. After the outbreak, population size increased moderately (5\u00B71%) during the first three post\u2010outbreak years before resuming a growth similar to pre\u2010outbreak levels (13\u00B79%). We found no evidence that these demographic changes were driven by density dependence or other ecological factors. 4. Most hyenas showed signs of infection when prey abundance in their territory was low. During the outbreak, mortality increased among adult males and yearlings, but not among adult females \u2013 the socially dominant group members. These results suggest that infection and mortality were modulated by factors linked to low social status and poor nutrition. During the outbreak, we estimated R (0) for the bacterium to be 2\u00B77, indicating relatively fast transmission. 5. Our results suggest that the short\u2010term \u2018top\u2013down\u2019 impact of S. equi ruminatorum during the outbreak was driven by \u2018bottom\u2013up\u2019 effects on nutritionally disadvantaged age\u2013sex classes, whereas the longer\u2010term post\u2010outbreak reduction in population growth was caused by poor survival of juveniles during the outbreak and subsequent poor recruitment of breeding females.

We report the clinical and microbiological features of patients infected with influenza A H7N9 virus and compare genomic features of the human virus with those of the virus in market poultry in Zhejiang, China. METHODS: Between March 7 and April 8, 2013, we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infiltrate, and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines. We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identified and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient\u0027s and the chicken\u0027s isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes. FINDINGS: We identified four patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3\u20138 days before disease onset. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. Two patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs. The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affinity for \u03B1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2. INTERPRETATION: Cross species poultry-to-person transmission of this new reassortant H7N9 virus is associated with severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in human beings. Monitoring of the viral evolution and further study of disease pathogenesis will improve disease management, epidemic control, and pandemic preparedness.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Devaux, Christian A.; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/130a1a27637331d206d4a8af2827bf929c5a9694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118659.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171740/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300881; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920300881; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","possible effect of chloroquine","novel coronavirus","China","possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference","Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing","aetiological agent of coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","treatment of COVID","severe effects","new trials","public-health emergency","known efficient therapy","efforts of international health authorities","situation","spread","hydroxychloroquine","rapid diagnosis","sense","coronaviruses","isolation of patients","therapies able","drastic containment measures","search","absence","potent inhibitor","nCoV","replication cycle","pulmonary infection","humans","ABSTRACT","molecule"],"language":"en"},

So far no extensive review on existing evidence regarding bio-aerosols is available. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to review evidence on bio-aerosols in healthcare and the dental setting. The objectives were 1) What are the sources that generate bio-aerosols?; 2) What is the microbial load and composition of bio-aerosols and how were they measured?; and 3) What is the hazard posed by pathogenic micro-organisms transported via the aerosol route of transmission? METHODS: Systematic scoping review design. Searched in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to 09-03-2016. References were screened and selected based on abstract and full text according to eligibility criteria. Full text articles were assessed for inclusion and summarized. The results are presented in three separate objectives and summarized for an overview of evidence. RESULTS: The search yielded 5,823 studies, of which 62 were included. Dental hand pieces were found to generate aerosols in the dental settings. Another 30 sources from human activities, interventions and daily cleaning performances in the hospital also generate aerosols. Fifty-five bacterial species, 45 fungi genera and ten viruses were identified in a hospital setting and 16 bacterial and 23 fungal species in the dental environment. Patients with certain risk factors had a higher chance to acquire Legionella in hospitals. Such infections can lead to irreversible septic shock and death. Only a few studies found that bio-aerosol generating procedures resulted in transmission of infectious diseases or allergic reactions. CONCLUSION: Bio-aerosols are generated via multiple sources such as different interventions, instruments and human activity. Bio-aerosols compositions reported are heterogeneous in their microbiological composition dependent on the setting and methodology. Legionella species were found to be a bio-aerosol dependent hazard to elderly and patients with respiratory complaints. But all aerosols can be can be hazardous to both patients and healthcare workers.","publish_time":"2017-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zemouri, Charifa; de Soet, Hans; Crielaard, Wim; Laheij, Alexa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8b614e1c39170f6cab8198aa119e71f28421669.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5439730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28531183/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bio-aerosols compositions","composition of bio","bio-aerosol dependent hazard","patients","different sources","multiple sources","healthcare workers","bacterial species","Legionella species","dental environment","dental settings","different interventions","aerosol route of transmission","existing evidence","overview of evidence","fungal species","extensive review","Dental hand pieces","results","studies","separate objectives","microbiological composition dependent","human activities","human activity","pathogenic nature","pathogenic micro-organisms","Systematic scoping review design","text articles","transmission of infectious diseases","higher chance","daily cleaning performances","certain risk factors","instruments","procedures","irreversible septic shock","allergic reactions","METHODS","fungi genera","respiratory complaints","microbial load","infections","death","viruses","hospitals","methodology","study","eligibility criteria","PubMed","EMBASE","inception","inclusion","search","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","References"],"language":"en"},

We describe here the burden of these viruses in hospital settings over a five-year period. METHODS: All respiratory samples from adult patients (\u003E20 years old) tested by multiplex-PCR at the request of physicians, from May 1 2011 to April 30 2016, were included retrospectively. Viral findings are reported by season, patient age group, respiratory tract region (upper or lower) and type of clinical unit (intensive care unit, pneumology unit, lung transplantation unit and other medical units). RESULTS: In total, 7196 samples (4958 patients) were included; 29.2% tested positive, with viral co-infections detected in 1.6% of samples. Overall, two viral groups accounted for 60.2% of all viruses identified: picornaviruses (rhinovirus or enterovirus, 34.3%) and influenza (26.6%). Influenza viruses constituted the group most frequently identified in winter (34.4%), in the upper respiratory tract (32%) and in patients over the age of 70 years (36.4%). Picornavirus was the second most frequently identified viral group in these populations and in all other groups, including lower respiratory tract infections (41.3%) or patients in intensive care units (37.6%). CONCLUSION: This study, the largest to date in Europe, provides a broad picture of the distribution of viruses over seasons, age groups, types of clinical unit and respiratory tract regions in the hospital setting. It highlights the burden associated with the neglected picornavirus group.

A scanning mobility particle sizer and impingers at sampling ports were used to show that viability is preserved and particle size distribution (PSD) is acceptably uniform throughout the open CATS, including the 12 ports of the NOIES, and that a particle filter used caused the expected attenuation of particle counts. CONCLUSIONS: Controlled Aerosol Test System delivers uniformly to mice constrained in the NOIES a selectable dose of viral bioaerosol whose PSD and viable counts remain consistent for an hour.

This provides a major improvement over the use of viable bioaerosol collectors (e.g. impactors and impingers), which provide data that are difficult to relate to the attenuation of pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2012-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stone, B.R.; Heimbuch, B.K.; Wu, C.\u2010Y.; Wander, J.D.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31b864682a988b903df49da5b227ca60dae77508.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166589.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05403.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSD","CATS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Controlled Aerosol Test System","viable infective aerosol","NOIES","new test system","viable counts","particle filter","expected attenuation of particle counts","use of viable bioaerosol collectors","selected dose of infective bioaerosol","impingers","PSD","respiratory protective technology","Inhalation Exposure System","particle size distribution","inspired pathogenic aerosol","open CATS","selectable dose of viral bioaerosol","scanning mobility particle sizer","study\u0027s characterization of CATS","ability of respiratory protective technologies","animal model","sampling ports","treatment technology","quantitative method","attenuation of pathogenicity","infectivity","RESULTS","mice","Nose","viability","impactors","CONCLUSIONS","breathing zone","major improvement","mouse","detector","proportional clinical response","hour","METHODS","SIGNIFICANCE","project","data","aim"],"language":"en"},

The concentrations of free gossypol were varied by varying amounts of cottonseed meals from three different sources. Cottonseed meal totaled 31% of each treatment ration. Feed consumption, BW, and blood parameters were collected on all calves at 30-d intervals throughout the trial. There were no significant differences between the groups for feed consumption, BW, or average daily gain. Changes in the group means for hematology and chemistry variables examined were modest and insufficient to distinguish diagnostically between safe and unsafe free gossypol concentrations for the different groups. Clinical evidence of disease was limited to the calves fed 400 or 800ppm of free gossypol after 90 d of age. One calf in the group fed 400ppm and 4 in the group fed 800ppm died as a result of circulatory failure associated with gossypol consumption. We conclude from this study that a ration containing up to 200ppm of free gossypol is safe, 400ppm of free gossypol is toxic, and 800ppm of free gossypol results in death losses.

However, the post-SARS period confirmed that this practice was not sustainable. At the Singapore General Hospital, a 1,600-bedded acute tertiary care hospital, the hand hygiene program was revised in early 2007 following Singapore\u0027s signing of the pledge to the World Health Organization (WHO) \u0022Clean Care is Safer Care\u0022 program. FINDINGS: A multi-prong approach was used in designing the hand hygiene program. This included system change; training and education; evaluation and feedback; reminders in the workplace; and institutional safety climate. Hand hygiene compliance rate improved from 20% (in January 2007) to 61% (2010). Improvement was also seen annually in the compliance to each of the 5 moments as well as in all staff categories. Healthcare-associated MRSA infections were reduced from 0.6 (2007) to 0.3 (2010) per 1000 patient-days. CONCLUSIONS: Leadership\u0027s support of the program evidenced through visible leadership presence, messaging and release of resources is the key factor in helping to make the program a true success. The hospital was recognised as a Global Hand Hygiene Expert Centre in January 2011.

In the case of avian influenza, the movement of live birds is a well known risk factor for the geographic dissemination of the virus among poultry flocks. Live bird markets (LBM\u0027s) contribute to the epidemiology of avian influenza due to their demographic characteristics and the presence of HPAI H5N1 virus lineages. The relationship between poultry producers and live poultry traders (LPT\u0027s) that operate in LBM\u0027s has not been adequately documented in HPAI H5N1-affected SE Asian countries. The aims of this study were to document and study the flow of live poultry in a poultry trade network in northern Vietnam, and explore its potential role in the risk for HPAI H5N1 during 2003 to 2006. RESULTS: Our results indicate that LPT\u0027s trading for less than a year and operating at retail markets are more likely to source poultry from flocks located in communes with a past history of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks during 2003 to 2006 than LPT\u0027s trading longer than a year and operating at wholesale markets. The results of the network analysis indicate that LPT\u0027s tend to link communes of similar infection status. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence which can be used for informing policies aimed at encouraging more biosecure practices of LPT\u0027s operating at authorised LBM\u0027s. The results suggest that LPT\u0027s play a role in HPAI H5N1 transmission and may contribute to perpetuating HPAI H5N1 virus circulation amongst certain groups of communes. The impact of current disease prevention and control interventions could be enhanced by disseminating information about outbreak risk and the implementation of a formal data recording scheme at LBM\u0027s for all incoming and outgoing LPT\u0027s.","publish_time":"2010-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soares Magalh\u00E3es, Ricardo J; Ortiz-Pelaez, Angel; Thi, Kim Lan Lai; Dinh, Quoc Hoang; Otte, Joachim; Pfeiffer, Dirk U","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/345180770287ab9188e2dcfa2fd2ba0cd58214bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2837645.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-6-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20175881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI","LPT","LBM"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["LPT\u0027s trading","HPAI H5N1 transmission","poultry flocks","HPAI H5N1 virus circulation","outgoing LPT\u0027s","RESULTS","live poultry traders","flow of live poultry","poultry producers","presence of HPAI H5N1 virus lineages","poultry trade network","past history of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks","biosecure practices of LPT\u0027s","study","Live bird markets","authorised LBM\u0027s","movement of live birds","potential role","important role","outbreak risk","year","retail markets","wholesale markets","known risk factor","certain groups of communes","case of avian influenza","epidemiology of avian influenza","network analysis","communes of similar infection status","implementation","geographic dissemination","formal data recording scheme","northern Vietnam","demographic characteristics","control interventions","impact of current disease prevention","contagious diseases","structure of contact","individuals","incursion","information","SE Asian countries","relationship","animal populations","BACKGROUND","policies","CONCLUSIONS","evidence","aims"],"language":"en"},

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes two S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTase) which sequentially methylate the RNA cap at guanosine-N7 and ribose 2\u2032-O positions, catalyzed by nsp14 N7-MTase and nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase, respectively. A unique feature for SARS-CoV is that nsp16 requires non-structural protein nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its MTase activity. Here we report the biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV 2\u2032-O-MTase and the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex bound with methyl donor SAM. We found that SARS-CoV nsp16 MTase methylated m7GpppA-RNA but not m7GpppG-RNA, which is in contrast with nsp14 MTase that functions in a sequence-independent manner. We demonstrated that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind both m7GpppA-RNA substrate and SAM cofactor. Structural analysis revealed that nsp16 possesses the canonical scaffold of MTase and associates with nsp10 at 1\u22361 ratio. The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16, consistent with the findings in biochemical assays. These results suggest that nsp16/nsp10 interface may represent a better drug target than the viral MTase active site for developing highly specific anti-coronavirus drugs.","publish_time":"2011-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yu; Su, Ceyang; Ke, Min; Jin, Xu; Xu, Lirong; Zhang, Zhou; Wu, Andong; Sun, Ying; Yang, Zhouning; Tien, Po; Ahola, Tero; Liang, Yi; Liu, Xinqi; Guo, Deyin","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ec19e6a2799bf2bebe635732de198d04ddedf64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3192843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22022266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SAM"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-MTase","nsp14 MTase","SARS-CoV nsp16 MTase methylated m7GpppA-RNA","MTase activity","crystal structure of nsp16","nsp10 interface","nsp14 N7-MTase","substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16","RNA cap","nsp10 complex","canonical scaffold of MTase","RNA stability","viral MTase active site","m7GpppG-RNA","SARS coronavirus","m7GpppA-RNA substrate","non-structural protein nsp10","nsp10 interaction interface","cap structure","biochemical characterization of SARS","cellular mRNA structure","SAM-binding pocket","O positions","SAM cofactor","viral immune escape","end of viral RNAs","protein translation","distinct feature of eukaryotic mRNAs","guanosine-N7","eukaryotic viruses","unique feature","biochemical assays","specific anti-coronavirus drugs","better drug target","functions","stimulatory factor","methionine","ribose","methyl donor","findings","S-adenosyl","dependent methyltransferases","associates","contrast","sequence-independent manner","results","Structural analysis","ratio"],"language":"en"},

While gNO has been shown, in vitro, to be an effective antibacterial agent (at 160ppm), NO-donor compounds have been shown to inhibit a variety of viruses at varying stages of replication. This research was done in order to determine whether gNO at 80 or 160ppm possesses an antiviral effect on influenza viruses. Three strains of influenza (A and B) were exposed to gNO for up to 180min, before and after infection of MDCK cells. In search for possible mechanism of antiviral action, Neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay of H1N1 that was exposed to gNO was performed. Results show that when virions were exposed to gNO prior to infection a complete inhibition of infectivity was achieved for all three strains. Post infection exposure of influenza with gNO resulted in about 30% inhibition of infectivity. Further testing showed that when eliminating the pH effect by exposing a dried virus to gNO, 90% inhibition was found after 2h exposure. NA activity, of whole dried H1N1 virus, was found to be inhibited by gNO (80%). These results suggest that 80 and 160ppm gNO have a time dependent antiviral effect on influenza strains of viruses during various stages of cellular infection, which are not due to concomitant changes in pH in the surrounding milieu. Viral NA inhibition by gNO was shown and may be responsible for this antiviral effect.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regev-Shoshani, Gilly; Vimalanathan, Selvarani; McMullin, Bevin; Road, Jeremy; Av-Gay, Yossef; Miller, Chris","journal":"Nitric Oxide","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48899f59aff5272d5f03f7ceed8847722d958803.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110511.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2013.03.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860313001146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23562771/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1089860313001146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ppm gNO","influenza viruses","strains of influenza","influenza strains of viruses","pH effect","Viral NA inhibition","Post infection exposure of influenza","inhibition assay of H1N1","complete inhibition of infectivity","time dependent antiviral effect","variety of viruses","various stages of cellular infection","NA activity","dried H1N1 virus","dried virus","infection of MDCK cells","Results","possible mechanism of antiviral action","h exposure","varying stages of replication","Neuraminidase","inhalation","approved vasodilator drug","Abstract Gaseous nitric oxide","concomitant changes","surrounding milieu","maximum dose","effective antibacterial agent","virions","donor compounds","order","research","testing"],"language":"en"},

In this study, by an immunoblot analysis, we investigated the IgE-reactive components of FCS using sera from 16 dogs that exhibited allergic reactions after vaccination. The immunoblot analysis revealed that several FCS proteins of approximately 25-, 50-, 66-, 75-, 120-, and 175-kDa strongly reacted with IgE in the sera from dogs that showed post-vaccination allergic reactions. The 66-kDa band was detected in the sera from 14 of the 16 dog serum samples analyzed in the immunoblot analysis for FCS, and it was speculated to be albumin based on its molecular weight; however, serum IgE reactivity to bovine serum albumin could be detected in only four of the 14 dog samples. These findings demonstrated that a variety of FCS components including albumin could function as allergens in dogs that developed allergic reactions after vaccination.","publish_time":"2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohmori, Keitaro; Masuda, Kenichi; DeBoer, Douglas J.; Sakaguchi, Masahiro; Tsujimoto, Hajime","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcbe4ab12c1a4e609368fa8ee16bf3519c3010fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112532.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242706002789; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242706002789","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":["FCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dogs","sera","post-vaccination allergic reactions","serum IgE reactivity","IgE-reactive components of FCS","FCS proteins","analysis","bovine serum albumin","variety of FCS components","dog serum samples","presence of IgE","fetal calf serum","dog samples","kDa band","allergens","molecular weight","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

This was a retrospective single-center study of 156 consecutive HSCT recipients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between May 2013 and July 2017. Findings from a microbiologic diagnostic workup using currently available methods on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples from 66 patients (age, 58 years [range, 45 to 64]; HSCT to ICU, 176 days [range, 85 to 407]) with ARF and pulmonary infiltrates were analyzed. In 47 patients (71%) a causative pathogen was identified (fungal, n = 28; viral, n = 26; bacterial, n = 18). Polymicrobial findings involving several pathogen groups occurred in 20 patients (30%). Culture (12/16, 75%), galactomannan (13/15, 87%), and Aspergillus-PCR (8/9, 89%) from BAL but not serum galactomannan (6/14, 43%) helped to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (n = 16, 24%). Aspergillus-PCR detected azole resistance in 2 cases. Mucorales was found in 7 patients (11%; BAL culture, n = 6; Mucorales-PCR, n = 1). Patients with identified pathogens had higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores (P = .049) and inferior ICU survival (6% versus 37%, P \u003C .01), which largely related to the presence of an invasive fungal infection. Eight patients (12%) had 1 or more viruses with uncertain lung pathogenicity as the sole microbiologic finding. A diagnostic microbiologic workup incorporating molecular- and biomarker-based assays identified pathogens in most HSCT recipients with ARF and pulmonary infiltrates admitted to the ICU.

Moreover, ORF 5 protein was localized both in the perinuclear region and the Golgi complex and transported to the cell surface.

Data of patients included demographic, epidemiological, clinical features, chest radiographs of imported cases, local cases, second-generation cases and third-generation cases. Student\u0027s t-test was adopted for quantitative variables while Pearson Chi-squared test or Fisher\u0027s exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: The median age was 47 years and common symptoms of illness were cough (50.7%), fever (47.1%) and fatigue (14.0%). The time from contact symptomatic case to illness was 7.7 days, and 88 patients (64.7%) were cluster cases, radiological evidence found bilateral lung involvement was common (57.4%).Compared with the imported cases, the local cases were significantly older, the proportion of men is lower. There was higher proportion of cluster cases in local cases. Unlike imported cases, which fever was the dominant symptom, the local cases have more cough patients, with a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients.

In general, the order, number and size of ORFs were consistent with other gammacoronaviruses. Three points of recombination were predicted, one towards the end of 1a, a second in 1b just upstream of S and a third in 3b. Phylogenetic analysis of the four regions defined by these three points supported the previous notion that European and American viruses do indeed have different evolutionary pathways. Very close relationships were revealed between the European TCoV and the European guinea fowl coronavirus in all regions except one, and both were shown to be closely related to the European infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Italy 2005. None of these regions of sequence grouped European and American TCoVs. The region of sequence containing the S gene was unique in grouping all turkey and guinea fowl coronaviruses together, separating them from IBVs. Interestingly the French guinea fowl virus was more closely related to the North American viruses. These data demonstrate that European turkey and guinea fowl coronaviruses share a common genetic backbone (most likely an ancestor of IBV Italy 2005) and suggest that this recombined in two separate events with different, yet related, unknown avian coronaviruses, acquiring their S-3a genes. The data also showed that the North American viruses do not share a common backbone with European turkey and guinea fowl viruses; however, they do share similar S-3a genes with guinea fowl virus.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, P.

Methods This study utilized a questionnaire to collect institutional data about hospital infrastructure and volume of patient safety activities from all 1039 teaching hospitals in Japan. The patient safety activities were focused on meetings and conferences, internal audits, staff education and training, incident reporting and infection surveillance. Generalized linear modeling was used. Results Of the 1039 hospitals surveyed, 418 (40.2%) hospitals participated. The amount of activities significantly increased by over 30% in hospitals with dedicated patient safety and infection control full-time staff (P \u003C0.001 and P \u003C0.01, respectively). High profit margins also predicted the increase of patient safety programs (P \u003C0.01). Perceived lack of administrative leadership was associated with reduced volume of activities (P \u003C0.05), and the economic burden of safety programs was found to be disproportionately large for small hospitals (P \u003C0.05). Conclusions Hospitals with increased resources had greater spread of patient safety and infection control activities. To promote patient safety programs in hospitals, it is imperative that policy makers require the assignment of dedicated full-time staff to patient safety. Economic support for hospitals will also be required to assure that safety programs are sustainable.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukuda, Haruhisa; Imanaka, Yuichi; Hirose, Masahiro; Hayashida, Kenshi","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92364618ca3fcff376a07cbea3731031f50a03fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132441.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.04.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851008001036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18538442/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851008001036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["dedicated patient safety","volume of patient safety activities","increase of patient safety programs","greater spread of patient safety","economic burden of safety programs","teaching hospitals","Conclusions Hospitals","small hospitals","infection control activities","infection control full-time staff","reduced volume of activities","system-level activities","infection surveillance","staff education","assignment of dedicated full-time staff","hospital infrastructure","increased resources","Economic support","hospital structural characteristics","training","relationship","internal audits","incident reporting","conferences","meetings","institutional data","questionnaire","policy makers","use","Perceived lack of administrative leadership","incentive structure","High profit margins","study","Abstract Objective","Methods","Japan","linear modeling","Results"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about respiratory virus transmission is advancing. Spread is likely through the air, but much work remains to be done to characterize the aerosols produced by infected individuals, including viral particle survival and infectivity. Although coughs have been characterized, little work has been done to examine coughs from infected individuals. The WeCoF project aims at providing evidence to support prevention measures to mitigate person-to-person influenza transmission in critical locations, such as hospitals, and during pandemics. FINDINGS: A novel experimental cough chamber facility \u2013 the FLUGIE \u2013 has been developed to study the far-field aerodynamics and aerosol transport of droplets produced by the coughs from humans naturally-infected with influenza. The flow field of each cough is measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A preliminary study involving 12 healthy individuals has been carried out in order to quantify the strengths of their coughs at a distance of 1 m from the mouth. The spatially averaged maximum velocity was determined and the average value was 0.41 m/s across 27 coughs of good data quality. The peak value of velocity was also extracted and compared with the average velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that there is significant air motion associated with a cough (on the order of 0.5 m/s) as far away as 1 m from the mouth of the healthy person who coughs. The results from this pilot study provide the framework for a more extensive participant recruitment campaign that will encompass a statistically-significant cohort.","publish_time":"2014-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savory, Eric; Lin, William E; Blackman, Karin; Roberto, Matthew C; Cuthbertson, Lauren R; Scott, James A; Mubareka, Samira","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b138ca6c96ce56fb2db1641847bd7686ca1cdff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4150972.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected individuals","person influenza transmission","Influenza virus","healthy person","healthy individuals","average velocity","preliminary study","coughs of good data quality","Preliminary results","average value","peak value of velocity","pilot study","order","mouth","respiratory virus transmission","significant air motion","averaged maximum velocity","field aerodynamics","flow field","significant cohort","little work","novel experimental cough chamber facility","viral particle survival","Particle Image Velocimetry","cause of major pandemics","annual deaths","seasonal epidemics","framework","aerosol transport of droplets","critical locations","evidence","FINDINGS","FLUGIE","extensive participant recruitment campaign","millions of human lives","PIV","hospitals","infectivity","prevention measures","Knowledge","BACKGROUND","distance","strengths","humans","WeCoF project","century","Spread","CONCLUSIONS","aerosols"],"language":"en"},

The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14(\u002B\u002B) monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14(\u002B\u002B)IL1\u03B2(\u002B) monocytes in the ERS. CD4(\u002B) T cells and CD8(\u002B) T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the na\u00EFve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1\u03B2 and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Wen; Su, Wenru; Tang, Hao; Le, Wenqing; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Zheng, Yingfeng; Liu, Xiuxing; Xie, Lihui; Li, Jianmin; Ye, Jinguo; Dong, Liwei; Cui, Xiuliang; Miao, Yushan; Wang, Depeng; Dong, Jiantao; Xiao, Chuanle; Chen, Wei; Wang, Hongyang","journal":"Cell Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b228130aeca0362842c716844d5e0550ea5f4da9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197635.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377375/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0168-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","recovery of COVID","IGHV3","recovery stage of COVID","plasma cells","ERS","treatment of COVID","course of COVID","na\u00EFve B cells","monocytes","patients","inflammatory storm","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","novel B cell-receptor","inflammatory immune signature","high levels of inflammatory genes","early recovery stage","high inflammatory gene expression","Identification of novel BCR","SARS-CoV","novel candidate target genes","key immune cell subsets","increased ratio of classical CD14","transcriptional changes","development of vaccines","single-cell RNA sequencing technique","greater abundance of CD14","virus vaccine development","CSF","states","TNFSF13","monoclonal state","IGHJ4","evidence","antibodies","CD8","strongest pairing frequencies","hospital discharge","isotypes","integrated analysis","specificity","IL1\u03B2","CD4","study","IGKV3","people"],"language":"en"},

Frequent hand washing implies a prolonged exposure to water and other chemical or physical agents and may induce several pathophysiologic changes, such as epidermal barrier disruption, impairment of keratinocytes, the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of the skin immune system, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Adverse dermatologic effects, such as excessive skin dryness or even contact dermatitis (particularly the irritant subtype and, to a lesser extent, the allergic subtype), can occur, especially in individuals with a history of atopic dermatitis. These skin conditions are perfectly manageable, and applying a moisturizer immediately after washing hands or after using a portable hand sanitizer is the cornerstone in preventing the development of eczematous changes in the hands.

The virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) is responsible for both viral attachment and release. Similarity to bovine and porcine torovirus hemagglutinin-esterase (BToV HE, PToV HE), bovine coronavirus HE (BCoV HE) and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (InfC HEF) proteins were exploited in a computational homology-based structure analysis of ISAV HE. The analysis resolved structural aspects of the protein and identified important features of relevance to ISAV HE activity. By recombinant expression and purification of secretory HE (recHE) proteins, receptor-binding and quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities displayed by ISAV HE molecules are presented for the first time. Three different recHE molecules were constructed: one representing a high virulent isolate, one a low virulent, while in the third a Ser32 to Ala32 amino acid substitution was introduced in the enzymatic catalytic site as inferred from the model. The three amino acid differences between the high and low virulent variants, of which two localized to the putative receptor-binding domain and one in the esterase domain, had no impact on receptor-binding or -release activities. In contrast, the Ser32 amino acid substitution totally abolished enzymatic activity while receptor binding increased, as observed by agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells. This demonstrates the essential role of a serine in the enzyme\u0027s catalytic site. In conclusion, structural analysis of ISAV HE in combination with selected recHE proteins gave insights into structure\u2013function relationships and opens up for further studies aiming at dissecting molecular determinants of ISAV virulence.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Anita; Markussen, Turhan; Drabl\u00F8s, Finn; Gj\u00F8en, Tor; J\u00F8rgensen, Trond \u00D8.; Solem, Stein Tore; Mjaaland, Siri","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae402e29204598d16eb615bd596149839b79155b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114507.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.03.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398710/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210001231; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210001231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISAV"],"locations":["Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["receptor binding","structural analysis of ISAV","esterase domain","putative receptor-binding domain","enzymatic activity","Ser32 amino acid substitution","selected recHE proteins","computational homology-based structure analysis of ISAV","amino acid differences","enzymatic catalytic site","porcine torovirus hemagglutinin-esterase","influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase","Ala32 amino acid substitution","virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase","farmed Atlantic salmon","dissecting molecular determinants of ISAV virulence","low virulent variants","high virulent isolate","release activities","different recHE molecules","quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities","enzyme\u0027s catalytic site","Abstract Infectious salmon anaemia virus","agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells","bovine coronavirus","structural aspects","insights","fusion","combination","serious disease","serine","BCoV","piscine orthomyxovirus","important features of relevance","BToV","purification of secretory","Salmo salar","InfC HEF","studies","function relationships","Similarity","PToV","contrast","impact","recombinant expression","viral attachment","conclusion","essential role","model","time"],"language":"en"},

Here we expressed EV71 3AB protein as recombinant protein in a eukaryotic expression system and uncovered that this protein possesses a nucleic acid helix-destabilizing and strand annealing acceleration activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that EV71 3AB is a nucleic acid chaperone protein.

This has prompted the scientific community to fully understand the formation, structure, and properties of these materials. In this review, we summarize and discuss the formation mechanism and relationships of the relevant biological structures and the artificial self-assembly systems. These structures can be formed through biological processes with amazing regulation across a great length scales; nevertheless, artificial construction normally produces the structure corresponding to the molecular size and shape. Notably, the block copolymeric system is considered to be an applicable and attractive model system for the study of biological systems due to their versatile design and rich phase behavior. Some of the phenomena found in these two systems are compared and discussed, and this information may provide new ideas for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between molecular shape and resulting interface curvature and the self-assembly process in living organisms. We argue that the co-polymeric system may serve as a model to understand these biological systems and could encourage additional studies of artificial self-assembly and the creation of new functional materials.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Congcong; Deng, Yuru; Han, Lu","journal":"Sci China Mater","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ec494dccc315c87a018705b470dfb5a6c8db4fe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-019-1261-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["artificial self-assembly systems","relevant biological structures","study of biological systems","biological processes","self-assembly process","additional studies of artificial self-assembly","artificial construction","miraculous hierarchical structures","attractive model system","molecular shape","Bicontinuous cubic structures","co-polymeric system","block copolymeric system","interface curvature","new ideas","molecular size","creation of new functional materials","formation mechanism","innumerable life forms","constant mean curvature","different life events","complex form","TPMSs","CMC","great length scales","amazing regulation","morphologies","versatile design","comprehensive understanding","various research fields","parallel surface companions","evolution","relationships","unique physical functionalities","rich phase behavior","billions of years","living organisms","periodic minimal surfaces","Nature","properties","scientific community","information","phenomena","review"],"language":"en"},

The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa I fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3\u2032 three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-11-dUTP. Using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells. In an in vivo study, the probe was used to detect FIPV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) isolated at various post-infection days (PID) from cats experimentally infected with the FIP-producing coronavirus isolate FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-DF2. Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22.

HPV binding to the cell surface of keratinocytes leads to virus endocytosis at tetraspanin enriched microdomains. Complex interactions of the capsid proteins with host proteins as well as ADAM17-dependent ERK1/2 signal transduction enable the entry platform assembly of the oncogenic HPV type 16. Here, we studied the importance of tetraspanin CD9, also known as TSPAN29, in HPV16 infection of different epithelial cells. We found that both overexpression and loss of the tetraspanin decreased infection rates in cells with low endogenous CD9 levels, while reduction of CD9 expression in keratinocytes that exhibit high-CD9 protein amounts, led to an increase of infection. Therefore, we concluded that low-CD9 supports infection. Moreover, we found that changes in CD9 amounts affect the shedding of the ADAM17 substrate transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03B1) and the downstream phosphorylation of ERK. These effects correlate with those on infection rates suggesting that a specific CD9 optimum promotes ADAM17 activity, ERK signalling and virus infection. Together, our findings implicate that CD9 regulates HPV16 infection through the modulation of ADAM17 sheddase activity.

HPyV, and specifically JCPyV, are known to co-diverge with their host, implying a slow rate of viral evolution and a large timescale of virus/host co-existence. Recent bio-informatic reports showed a large level of peptide homology between JCPyV and the human proteome. In this study, the antibody response to PyV peptides is evaluated. METHODS: The in-silico analysis of the HPyV proteome was followed by peptide microarray serology. A HPyV-peptide microarray containing 4,284 peptides was designed and covered 10 polyomavirus proteomes. Plasma samples from 49 healthy subjects were tested against these peptides. RESULTS: In-silico analysis of all possible HPyV 5-mer amino acid sequences were compared to the human proteome, and 1,609 unique motifs are presented. Assuming a linear epitope being as small as a pentapeptide, on average 9.3% of the polyomavirus proteome is unique and could be recognized by the host as non-self. Small t Ag (stAg) contains a significantly higher percentage of unique pentapeptides. Experimental evidence for the presence of antibodies against HPyV 15-mer peptides in healthy subjects resulted in the following observations: i) antibody responses against stAg were significantly elevated, and against viral protein 2 (VP2) significantly reduced; and ii) there was a significant correlation between the increasing number of embedded unique HPyV penta-peptides and the increase in microarray fluorescent signal. CONCLUSION: The anti-peptide HPyV-antibodies in healthy subjects are preferably directed against the penta-peptide derived unique fraction of the viral proteome.","publish_time":"2013-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stuyver, Lieven J; Verbeke, Tobias; Van Loy, Tom; Van Gulck, Ellen; Tritsmans, Luc","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ba696abf174e4bce2148e4bfd72f40b09c32add.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3691923.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPyV proteome","HPyV-peptide microarray","possible HPyV","anti-peptide HPyV-antibodies","human proteome","viral proteome","mer peptides","increasing number of embedded unique HPyV penta-peptides","healthy subjects","PyV peptides","peptide microarray serology","unique fraction","unique motifs","large level of peptide homology","Human polyomaviruses","silico analysis","JCPyV","higher percentage of unique pentapeptides","stAg","host co-existence","viral protein","microarray fluorescent signal","presence of antibodies","slow rate of viral evolution","antibody responses","polyomavirus proteomes","large timescale of virus","mild primary infections","Small t Ag","mer amino acid sequences","increase","following observations","Recent bio-informatic reports","lifelong nonpathogenic persistence","average","significant correlation","study","Experimental evidence","Plasma samples","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","linear epitope","non-self","VP2","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To prepare for the manufacture and first-in-human testing of the vaccine, we have developed a process to stably produce the recombinant MERS S377\u2013588 protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

In addition, hCD26/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) transgenic mice vaccinated with AddaVax-adjuvanted S377-588-Fc could produce neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and survived for at least 21 days after challenge with live MERS-CoV with no evidence of immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement.

The minimum active apelin fragment was also investigated. Methods and Results: [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 incubated with recombinant human ACE2 resulted in de novo generation of [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u201312)) identified by mass spectrometry. Endogenous [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u201312)) was detected by immunostaining in human heart and lung localized to the endothelium.

Conclusions: We provide evidence that ACE2 cleaves [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 to [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u201312)) and this cleavage product is expressed in human cardiovascular tissues. We have demonstrated biological activity of [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u201312)) at the human and rodent apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that reported enhanced ACE2 activity in cardiovascular disease should not significantly compromise the beneficial effects of apelin based therapies for example in PAH.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Peiran; Kuc, Rhoda E.; Brame, Aim\u00E9e L.; Dyson, Alex; Singer, Mervyn; Glen, Robert C.; Cheriyan, Joseph; Wilkinson, Ian B.; Davenport, Anthony P.; Maguire, Janet J.","journal":"Front Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/671f1c2956296e84da394af512513ea165882eba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5329011.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293165/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00092","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pyr","rodent apelin receptor","beneficial effects of apelin","truncated peptide apelin","pD","minimum active apelin fragment","human heart","recombinant human ACE2","human atria","human volunteers","human cardiovascular tissues","F13A","pK","human saphenous vein","nanomolar potency","enhanced ACE2 activity","putative ACE2 product","rank order of potency","nanomolar affinity","lung","nanomolar potencies","low micromolar potency","R10M","cardiovascular disease","significant biological activity","shorter fragments","dose-dependent increase","dose-dependent decrease","blood pressure","cleavage product","endogenous presence","highest affinity","forearm blood flow","anesthetized rat","paced mouse right ventricle","patients","peptides","potent inotrope","therapies","forskolin-stimulated cAMP","pulmonary arterial hypertension","predicted substrate","novo generation","novel therapeutic target","\u03B2-arrestin recruitment","example","Expression","PAH","data","immunostaining","evidence","binding","aim","endothelium","Conclusions","Methods","Results","mass spectrometry"],"language":"en"},

This author emphasizes the role of viruses, both in mediating cell fusions, such as the formation of the first eukaryotic cell(s) from a united crenarchaeon and prokaryota, and the transfer of host cell genes integrated into viral (phages) genomes. After rising above the Darwinian threshold, rigid rules of speciation and vertical inheritance in the three domains of life were established, but horizontal gene transfers with or without cell fusions were never abolished. The author proves with extensive, yet highly selective documentation, that not only unicellular microorganisms, but the most complex multicellular entities of the highest ranks resort to, and practice, cell fusions, and donate and accept horizontally (laterally) transferred genes. Cell fusions and horizontally exchanged genetic materials remain the fundamental attributes and inherent characteristics of the living matter, whether occurring accidentally or sought after intentionally. These events occur to cells stagnating for some 3 milliard years at a lower yet amazingly sophisticated level of evolution, and to cells achieving the highest degree of differentiation, and thus functioning in dependence on the support of a most advanced multicellular host, like those of the human brain. No living cell is completely exempt from gene drains or gene insertions.","publish_time":"2011-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sinkovics, Joseph G.","journal":"Cell Fusion in Health and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/538e0c7258dd7078e66bb662aa17f453724217c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21506007/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-0782-5_2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["living cell","eukaryotic cell","mediating cell fusions","transfer of host cell genes","primordial cells","sphero-protoplastic cells","gene drains","gene insertions","prokaryota","author","advanced multicellular host","horizontal gene transfers","genetic materials","life style","domains of life","living matter","milliard years","rigid rules of speciation","highest ranks resort","complex multicellular entities","highest degree of differentiation","cellular life\u2019s basic rules","history of widespread exchanges of genetic segments","inherent characteristics","vertical inheritance","fundamental attributes","competitor","ancestors of archaea","practice","overheated environment","unicellular microorganisms","Darwinian threshold","sophisticated level of evolution","support","united crenarchaeon","role of viruses","phages","formation","selective documentation","symbiose","article","useful possessions","dependence","survival","genomes","eukaryota","human brain","events"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This study enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with steroid\u2010induced necrosis of the femoral head. Patients had various stages of femoral head necrosis. The differential expression of serum proteins and mRNA from patients with steroid\u2010induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) and healthy volunteers was analyzed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT\u2010PCR). The pathological change in osteocyte necrosis was indicated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin stain showed histopathology changes in the necrotic area of patients with steroid\u2010induced INFH: bone trabeculae were fewer and thinner, became broken, fragmented and structurally disordered; intraosseous adipose cells became enlarged; the arrangement of the osteoblasts became irregular; and vacant bone lacunae increased. QT\u2010PCR showed significantly lower levels of \u03B1\u20102\u2010macroglobulin in the serum of patients with SINFH than in controls (P \u003C 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated that the expression of \u03B1\u20102\u2010macroglobulin was significantly decreased in the necrotic area of SINFH patients (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: The \u03B1\u20102\u2010macroglobulin may be associated with the pathology of SINFH.

Although generally a mild and self-limiting disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden. Worldwide, up to 40% of children aged less than 5 years with diarrhea are hospitalized with rotavirus. Also, some microorganisms have been found predominantly in resource-constrained nations, including Shigella spp, Vibrio cholerae, and the protozoan infections. Prevention remains essential, and the rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated good safety and efficacy profiles in large clinical trials. Because dehydration is the major complication associated with gastroenteritis, appropriate fluid management (oral or intravenous) is an effective and safe strategy for rehydration. Continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended.

Calves that drink water from rivers, streams, and ponds had a higher chance of being infected by Eimeria spp. (P \u003C 0.0001), as well as developing infection by nematodes (P \u003C 0.0001). The results found in this study highlight the importance of studying the agents of diarrhea together, once they act as coinfection where the losses triggered for the owners will involve some of these agents simultaneously.","publish_time":"2019-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruvinel, Leonardo Bueno; Ayres, Henderson; Zapa, Dina Mar\u00EDa Beltr\u00E1n; Nicaretta, Jo\u00E3o Eduardo; Couto, Luiz Fellipe Monteiro; Heller, Luciana Maffini; Bastos, Thiago Souza Azeredo; Cruz, Breno Cayeiro; Soares, Vando Ed\u00E9sio; Teixeira, Weslen Fabricio; de Oliveira, Juliana Silva; Fritzen, Juliana Tomazi; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo; Freire, Roberta Lemos; Lopes, Welber Daniel Zanetti","journal":"Trop Anim Health Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e8bfa3e7f71d14244026b036057d5dd2d2e8647.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089087.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-02069-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CI"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["higher risk of occurrence","agents of diarrhea","occurrence of Rotavirus","higher probabilities of occurrence","risk factors","higher chance","prevalence of Coronavirus","dairy calves","Cryptosporidium","Eimeria","ages","nematodes","states of Brazil","present study","days old","rivers","streams","ponds","milk","diseases","receiver","characteristic","ROC","curve","municipalities","water","automatic feeders","animals","developing infection","positive correlation","importance","losses","farms","owners","coinfection","collections","results"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of oral candidiasis, other mucosal lesions, and xerostomia during interferon (IFN) therapy for HCV infection. METHODS: Of 124 patients with HCV-infected liver diseases treated with IFN therapy in our hospital, 14 (mean age 56.00 \u00B1 12.94 years) who attended to receive administration of IFN once a week were identified and examined for Candida infection and other oral lesions and for the measurement of salivary flow. Serological assays also were carried out. RESULTS: Cultures of Candida from the tongue surfaces were positive in 7 (50.0%) of the 14 patients with HCV infection at least once during IFN therapy. C. albicans was the most common species isolated. The incidence of Candida during treatment with IFN did not increase above that before treatment. Additional oral mucosal lesions were observed in 50.0% (7/14) of patients: OLP in three (21.4%), angular cheilitis in three (21.4%) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis in one (7.1%). OLP occurred in one patient before treatment with IFN, in one during treatment and in one at the end of treatment. 85.7% of the oral lesions were treated with topical steroids. We compared the characteristics of the 7 patients in whom Candida was detected at least once during IFN therapy (group 1) and the 7 patients in whom Candida was not detected during IFN therapy (group 2). The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions (P=0.0075) and incidence of external use of steroids (P=0.0308) in group 1 were significantly higher than in group 2. The average body weight of group 1 decreased significantly compared to group 2 (P=0.0088). Salivary flow decreased in all subjects throughout the course of IFN treatment and returned at 6(th) months after the end of treatment. In group 1, the level of albumin at the beginning of the 6(th) month of IFN administration was lower than in group 2 (P=0.0550). According to multivariate analysis, one factor, the presence of oral mucosal lesions, was associated with the detection of Candida. The adjusted odds ratio for the factor was 36.00 (95% confidence interval 2.68-1485.94). CONCLUSION: We should pay more attention to oral candidiasis as well as other oral mucosal lesions, in patients with weight loss during IFN treatment.","publish_time":"2012-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagao, Yumiko; Hashimoto, Kouji; Sata, Michio","journal":"BMC Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04c80346278c76be38e11fba9ee1a0fccc13c57f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3503792.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230x-12-155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23122361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral lesions","IFN therapy","patients","course of IFN treatment","administration of IFN","presence of oral mucosal lesions","prevalence of oral mucosal lesions","Additional oral mucosal lesions","Candida infection","end of treatment","month of IFN administration","HCV infection","occurrence of oral candidiasis","incidence of Candida","Oral lichen planus","Cultures of Candida","detection of Candida","average body weight of group","OLP","factor","HCV-infected liver diseases","measurement of salivary flow","weight loss","incidence of external use of steroids","topical steroids","interferon","hepatitis C virus","subjects","xerostomia","tongue surfaces","BACKGROUND","hospital","albicans","common species isolated","mean age","years","adjusted odds ratio","beginning","level of albumin","attention","months","week","multivariate analysis","recurrent aphthous stomatitis","study","RESULTS","METHODS","confidence interval","Serological assays","angular cheilitis","aim","CONCLUSION","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

However, the viral etiologies and clinical characteristics of outpatients with ARIs are poorly understood in China. Here, we identified the viral etiologies in outpatients with ARIs in Huzhou, China. RESULTS: Our results indicated that of 426 outpatients, 246 were positive for viruses. Of them, 221 were positive for a single virus, including influenza A, which comprised H3N2 (28.5%) and pandemic H1N1 (2009) (19.0%), enterovirus (10.4%), and influenza B (8.6%). Other single viruses were detected at less than 8.0%. Twenty-five patients were positively coinfected with two viruses. The prevalent viruses in coinfections were rhinovirus and H3N2 virus (28.0%). Viruses were major pathogens in young children (\u003C 5 years) (75.0%). Coinfections were prevalent in older adults (11.9%) and young children (9.5%). Virus-positive outpatients presented higher temperatures and more sore throat, fatigue and shortness of breath than virus-negative outpatients. ARIs and most virus detections peaked during the winter, but enteroviruses emerged between April and September. CONCLUSION: Viruses are major agents of ARIs among outpatients in Huzhou, China. There was a variation in the distribution of viruses across different age groups and seasons. These findings are beneficial for planning prevention and treatment services for outpatients with ARIs.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Xiaohong; Huang, Qiuling; Tao, Hong; Zou, Weihua; Gao, Min; Guo, Huihui; Yao, Xing; Cui, Dawei; Wang, Xiang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cccfb42207af2158ed271db543d30e82f801170.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6325799.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3668-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARIs"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Virus-positive outpatients","prevalent viruses","single viruses","distribution of viruses","virus-negative outpatients","H3N2 virus","clinical characteristics of outpatients","major agents of ARIs","virus detections","China","coinfections","Huzhou","viral etiologies","young children","RESULTS","major pathogens","influenza B","higher temperatures","sore throat","fatigue","planning prevention","shortness of breath","treatment services","different age groups","rhinovirus","seasons","acute respiratory infections","older adults","findings","winter","CONCLUSION","years","variation","pandemic H1N1","enteroviruses","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study is to summarize the outcomes of patients with novel COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) at our institution. Methods: In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020. The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days). The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. Conclusion: Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment. Follow-up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Wei; Zhong, Zheng; Xie, Xingzhi; Yu, Qizhi; Liu, Jun","journal":"Theranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88f74dbc6104b4f4b3eb2e4170d26e8b3ea66c1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292517/; https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.45016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCP","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["emergency cases","emergency type","emergency group","cases of NCP","treatment response of patients","outcomes of patients","fair response group","poor response group","good response group","outcomes of NCP patients","favorable response","common type group","clinical treatment","fair outcomes","fatal type","clinical outcomes","days","severe type","CT scans","follow-up CT changes","CT imaging features","alleviated symptoms","basal clinical characteristics","novel COVID","range","median hospital","institution","median duration of progress","novel coronavirus","different responses","kinds of responses","abnormal imaging findings","single-center study","pneumonia","increasing speed","risk factors","improvement","phase","progression","Methods","Rationale","numbers","purpose","date","Results","Conclusion","China"],"language":"en"},

Annual production, field performance, research emphases and trends, top articles, as well as main institutional and individual contributors by its top cited articles were analyzed. Some newly developed indicators related to words in title, author keywords, KeyWords Plus, first author, corresponding author, and Y-index were employed to provide in-depth information on topic and author contributions. Results showed that China has been closing the gap with the USA with the greatest growth, and has stood the second since 2006. Most top cited articles were published in 2000s, made up approximately seven tenths of total articles. Pronounced activities were found in chemistry and physics related categories. The core categories included multidisciplinary chemistry, physical chemistry, multidisciplinary materials science, and applied physics. Moreover, China\u0027s performance of nanotechnology and science, especially carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanostructures showed dramatic growth.

Our understanding of these fascinating viruses thus remains incomplete but it seemed appropriate at this moment to look back and reflect on our progress and most important questions that still puzzle us. It is also essential of being careful about concepts that seem so well established, but could still be better validated using new approaches. I hope that the few reflections presented here will stimulate discussions and maybe attract new investigators into the field of reovirus research. Many other aspects of the viral multiplication cycle would merit our attention. However, I will essentially limit my discussion to these central aspects of the viral cycle that are transcription of viral genes and their phenotypic expression through the host cell translational machinery.

In particular, proteolytic enzymes with Ub/Ubl processing activity appear to be more widespread than originally anticipated. It is therefore not surprising that bacterial and viral pathogens have exploited many ways to interfere with Ub/Ubl conjugation, but also de-conjugation. On one hand, pathogens were shown to manipulate host encoded enzymes. On the other hand, pathogen derived sequences of proteases specific for Ub/Ubls are emerging as a common feature shared by many viruses, bacteria and protozoa, and we are at an early stage of understanding how these proteases contribute to the pathogenesis of infection. Whereas some of these proteases share a common origin with mammalian cell encoded hydrolases with specific properties towards Ub/Ubls, most of them have ancient intrinsic functions, such as processing pathogen protein components, and may have acquired the specificity for Ub/Ubls by interacting with mammalian hosts and their immune system throughout evolution. Since many of these proteases are clearly distinct from their mammalian counterparts, they represent attractive targets for drug design against infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edelmann, Mariola J.; Kessler, Benedikt M.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/713dcc0600e26a226d9bf0067acb0ece7bae563c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126189.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443908001658; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443908001658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18817868/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.08.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ub/Ubl","Ub/Ubls"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ubls","Ubl conjugation","mammalian cell","mammalian hosts","mammalian counterparts","Ubl processing activity","pathogen derived sequences of proteases specific","hand","specific properties","processing pathogen protein components","common origin","common feature","proteolytic enzymes","viral pathogens","de-conjugation","Abstract Attachment of ubiquitin","hydrolases","attractive targets","modifiers","reversible post-translational modification","fate","drug design","infectious diseases","ancient intrinsic functions","viruses","immune system","ways","bacteria","evolution","function of proteins","protozoa","early stage","pathogenesis of infection","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Although a prophylactic vaccine for HEV has been developed, it is only licensed in China, and there is currently no effective, non-teratogenic treatment. HEV encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is the largest viral gene product, encoding the replicative machinery of the virus including a methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF1 additionally contains a number of poorly understood domains including a hypervariable region, a putative protease, and the so-called \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 domains. ORF2 is the viral capsid essential for formation of infectious particles and ORF3 is a small protein essential for viral release. In this review, we focus on the domains encoded by ORF1, which collectively mediate the virus\u2019 asymmetric genome replication strategy. We summarize what is known, unknown, and hotly debated regarding the coding and non-coding regions of HEV ORF1, and present a model of how HEV replicates its genome.","publish_time":"2019-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"LeDesma, Robert; Nimgaonkar, Ila; Ploss, Alexander","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ace038ad5c62cabf0d49f6b8cc9aa0ee6f39a656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723718.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HEV infections","non-coding regions of HEV ORF1","HEV-related deaths","single-stranded RNA virus","RNA helicase","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","viral release","Hepatitis E virus","understood domains","small protein essential","largest viral gene product","non-teratogenic treatment","asymmetric genome replication strategy","progress","formation of infectious particles","liver cirrhosis","ORF3","pregnant women","hypervariable region","replicative machinery","sense","putative protease","immunocompromised individuals","open reading frames","methyltransferase","model","Hepeviridae family","ORFs","mortality","ORF2","number","public health concern","prophylactic vaccine","review","China"],"language":"en"},

The dynamics of natural infection in camels are not well understood. Through systematic surveillance in Egypt, nasal, rectal, milk, urine and serum samples were collected from camels between June 2014 and February 2016. Locations included quarantines, markets, abattoirs, free-roaming herds and farmed breeding herds. The overall seroprevalence was 71% and RNA detection rate was 15%. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence (90% vs 61%) and higher RT-PCR detection rates (21% vs 12%) than locally raised camels. Juveniles had lower seroprevalence than adults (37% vs 82%) but similar RT-PCR detection rates (16% vs 15%). An outbreak in a breeding herd, showed that antibodies rapidly wane, that camels become re-infected, and that outbreaks in a herd are sustained for an extended time. Maternal antibodies titers were very low in calves regardless of the antibody titers of the mothers. Our results support the hypothesis that camels are a reservoir for MERS-CoV and that camel trade is an important route of introducing the virus into importing countries. Findings related to waning antibodies and re-infection have implications for camel vaccine development, disease management and zoonotic threat.","publish_time":"2017-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Mohamed A; Shehata, Mahmoud M; Gomaa, Mokhtar R; Kandeil, Ahmed; El-Shesheny, Rabeh; Kayed, Ahmed S; El-Taweel, Ahmed N; Atea, Mohamed; Hassan, Nagla; Bagato, Ola; Moatasim, Yassmin; Mahmoud, Sara H; Kutkat, Omnia; Maatouq, Asmaa M; Osman, Ahmed; McKenzie, Pamela P; Webby, Richard J; Kayali, Ghazi","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/307179cebf2bf9f9107f745af8f2899db6c51ca9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5285495.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28050021/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["vs","dromedary camels","raised camels","higher seroprevalence","higher RT-PCR detection rates","MERS-CoV","re-infection","similar RT-PCR detection rates","waning antibodies","Maternal antibodies titers","lower seroprevalence","overall seroprevalence","farmed breeding herds","RNA detection rate","camel trade","antibody titers","camel vaccine development","free-roaming herds","dynamics of natural infection","implications","disease management","nasal","milk","abattoirs","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe human infections","Egypt","urine","markets","calves","zoonotic threat","serum samples","quarantines","important route","adults","reservoir","systematic surveillance","Locations","Juveniles","outbreaks","hypothesis","intermediary host","Findings","extended time","mothers","results","countries"],"language":"en"},

While respiratory infections (RI) are very prevalent in humans, there is a striking lack of systematic knowledge on how it affects sleep. We recruited 100 people, among whom 28 became sick with an RI during the study period (fulfilling criteria for influenza-like illness, ILI, or acute respiratory infection, ARI). We measured sick participants\u2019 sleep at home, both objectively (actigraphy) and subjectively (diary ratings), for one week as well as four weeks later when healthy. During the week with RI, people spent objectively longer time in bed and had a longer total sleep time compared to the healthy week. During the infection, participants also had more awakenings, but no significant differences in sleep latency or sleep efficiency. While sick, people also reported increased difficulties falling asleep, worse sleep quality, more restless sleep and more shallow sleep, while they did not report sleep to be less sufficient. Most problems occurred at the beginning of the sickness week, when symptoms were strong, and showed signs of recovery thereafter (as indicated by interactions between condition and day/night of data collection for all the 10 sleep outcomes). The degree of symptoms of RI was related to a worse sleep quality and more restless sleep, but not to any of the objective sleep outcomes or the other subjective sleep variables. Having a higher body temperature was not significantly related to any of the sleep variables. This study suggests that having a respiratory infection is associated with spending more time in bed and sleeping longer, but also with more disturbed sleep, both objectively and subjectively. This novel study should be seen as being of pilot character. There is a need for larger studies which classify pathogen type and include baseline predictors, or that manipulate sleep, in order to understand whether the sleep alterations seen during infections are adaptive and whether sleep interventions could be used to improve recovery from respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lasselin, Julie; Ingre, Michael; Regenbogen, Christina; Olsson, Mats J.; Garke, Maria; Brytting, Mia; Edgar, Rachel; Lekander, Mats; Axelsson, John","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e17928fbacdbbaf6114e5139f6e4196beecd0f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2019.02.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159119301473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742884/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159119301473","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["restless sleep","sleep latency","sleep alterations","sleep efficiency","sleep interventions","shallow sleep","disturbed sleep","worse sleep quality","total sleep time","sick participants\u2019 sleep","objective sleep outcomes","subjective sleep variables","respiratory infections","people","healthy week","longer time","acute respiratory infection","sickness week","study period","novel study","signs of recovery","degree of symptoms","strong experimental support","adaptive immune response","increased difficulties","pathogen type","significant differences","day","influenza","illness","night of data collection","ILI","drive","larger studies","condition","interactions","striking lack of systematic knowledge","criteria","awakenings","humans","baseline predictors","home","actigraphy","need","beginning","diary ratings","order","higher body temperature","weeks","animals","pilot character","problems"],"language":"en"},

Empirical evidence demonstrates that once the regime intercept is included, the asymmetric effects of global sentiment on oil \u0026 gas, financials, and health care industry returns become less under optimism, as compared with under pessimism. More critically, the positive (negative) impact of global sentiment above (under) the threshold turns significant, indicating that global optimism leads industry returns to be overvalued, while pessimism leads them to be undervalued. For local market sentiment, our results support that higher local sentiment enhances the returns of basic materials, telecommunications, and utilities industries.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed. Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dashraath, Pradip; Jing Lin Jeslyn, Wong; Mei Xian Karen, Lim; Li Min, Lim; Sarah, Li; Biswas, Arijit; Arjandas Choolani, Mahesh; Mattar, Citra; Lin, Su Lin","journal":"American journal of obstetrics and gynecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dc4268a42adf3d5c55c87b7f6518de600b057c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820303434; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820303434?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217113/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthcare providers","Pregnant women","SARS-CoV","management of COVID","review of COVID","confirmed cases of COVID","susceptibility","pregnancy bias","system dominance","cardiorespiratory system","Th1 system","affected patients","infectious disease outbreaks","diagnostic challenges","intrauterine transmission","unique challenges","respiratory failure","vulnerable populations","mother vulnerable","viral infections","pneumonia pandemic","Fetal surveillance","index patient","frontline obstetric care providers safe","novel use of chloroquine","maternal-fetal complications","current coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome","definite evidence of vertical transmission","judicious use of personal protective equipment","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","responsible social distancing","assays","containment of cross","vaccine development","therapeutic controversies","special considerations","predisposition","growth restriction","understanding of pathophysiology","principles of workplace segregation","high-risk population","socioeconomic impact","continents","drastic measures","labor","antiviral therapy","T-helper","integrated approach","pregnancies","communities","fetuses","basic reproduction number","tertiary maternity units","nationwide lockdowns","latest options","mechanical changes","various factors integral","weeks","telemedicine","Th2","rapid progression","asymptomatic individuals","safety","flux","serious public health emergency","border closures","accelerated rate","substantial morbidity","literature","R0","delivery","cessation of symptoms","gravida","core","outcomes","clinical service model","essential services","framework","date","neonates","related deaths","aim","persons"],"language":"en"},

Because inflammation and oxidative stress are processes that can sustain each other, the ways pigs are able to activate their antioxidant defenses are critical for production performance and health during periods when the immune system is solicited. Selection for production performance can also influence reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress in different tissues. To establish the extent by which poor hygiene and selection for feed efficiency affected redox status, pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were housed in poor or good hygiene during 6 weeks. At the end, blood was collected in all pigs, and half of them were killed for tissue sampling. The remaining pigs were reared in good hygiene conditions during a recovery period of 7\u20138 weeks. RESULTS: At week 6, poor hygiene was associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity assessed by plasma ferric reducing ability in all pigs, and with greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides in the high RFI pigs (less efficient). Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs exhibited higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and greater thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations when compared with the low RFI pigs (more efficient). Poor hygiene conditions activated the antioxidant enzymes activities (glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in adipose tissue of both lines, but led to higher ROS production by mature adipocytes isolated from the high RFI pigs only. In liver and muscle, there were only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions. After the resilience period, adipose tissue of pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintained higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and for the high RFI line, displayed higher TBARS concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions. This could led to a lower inflammatory response and less impaired growth when these pigs are facing sanitary challenges during the production period.","publish_time":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sier\u017Cant, K.; Perruchot, M-H.; Merlot, E.; Le Floc\u2019h, N.; Gondret, F.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a7eaaf283f1005f17f029f26a9ec33eebe566bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6794813.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2107-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Poor hygiene conditions","remaining pigs","ways pigs","low RFI pigs","adipose tissue of pigs","Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs","Poor hygiene of housing","good hygiene conditions","production period","higher ROS production","high RFI line","production performance","higher antioxidant enzyme activities","antioxidant enzymes activities","higher activities of catalase","antioxidant molecules","antioxidant defenses","oxidative stress","higher TBARS concentrations","lower inflammatory response","lower total antioxidant capacity","tissue sampling","glutathione reductase","improved feed efficiency","lower susceptibility","cellular response","systemic inflammatory response","Selection","recovery period","resilience period","weeks","residual feed intake","greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides","greater thiobarbituric acid reactive substances","reactive oxygen species","expression levels of genes","plasma ferric reducing ability","superoxide dismutase","mature adipocytes","health","redox status","impaired growth","periods","genetics","minor changes","different tissues","sanitary challenges","lines","muscle","immune system","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","extent","RESULTS","blood","inflammation","half","end","liver"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the N genes of 15 PEDV strains were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the pMT-19T vector, sequenced, and compared to each other as well as to PEDV reference strains. The nucleotide sequences of the N gene of the Chinese PEDV strains consist of 1326 nucleotides and encode a 441-aa-long peptide. The nucleotide sequences of the fifteen PEDV strains in our study were 96.1-100 % identical to each other, and the deduced amino acid sequences were 94.8-100 % identical. Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from GenBank revealed that their nucleotide sequences were 94.2-99.7 % identical to those of the Chinese PEDV strains, and their deduced amino acid sequences were 94.1-99.5 % identical. In addition, the fifteen strains showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity to the early domestic strains (98.4-99.7 %) except the LZC strain, but less sequence identity to the vaccine strain (CV777) used in China (94.7-97.7 %). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Chinese PEDV strains are composed of a separate cluster including three early domestic strains (JS-2004-02, LJB/03 and DX) but differ genetically from the vaccine strain (CV777) and the early Korean strains (Chinju99 and SM98).","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhili; Chen, Feng; Yuan, Yao; Zeng, Xiduo; Wei, Zhongyan; Zhu, Ling; Sun, Baoli; Xie, Qingmei; Cao, Yongchang; Xue, Chunyi; Ma, Jingyun; Bee, Yingzuo","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9a4350a22b0ac2d527dbbea0b0d4ebde180e2bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3668129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23389550/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1592-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","GenBank"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Chinese PEDV strains","PEDV reference strains","early domestic strains","early Korean strains","nucleotide sequences","vaccine strain","deduced amino acid sequences","early diagnosis","high degree of nucleotide sequence identity","CV777","Sequence comparison","N genes","vaccine development","LZC strain","study","China","acute diarrhea","candidate protein","high mortality rates","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","dehydration","separate cluster","swine","Chinju99","SM98","JS","nucleotides","GenBank","Phylogenetic analysis","pMT","RT-PCR","aa-long peptide","T vector","LJB","nucleocapsid","DX","addition"],"language":"en"},

Multi-protein profiling of gastric fluids, obtained from the anatomic site of pathology, could reveal diagnostic proteomic fingerprints. METHODS: Protein profiles were generated from gastric fluid samples of 19 gastric cancer and 36 benign gastritides patients undergoing elective, clinically-indicated gastroscopy using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on multiple ProteinChip arrays. Proteomic features were compared by significance analysis of microarray algorithm and two-way hierarchical clustering. A second blinded sample set (24 gastric cancers and 29 clinically benign gastritides) was used for validation. RESULTS: By significance analysyis of microarray, 60 proteomic features were up-regulated and 46 were down-regulated in gastric cancer samples (p \u003C 0.01). Multimarker clustering showed two distinctive proteomic profiles independent of age and ethnicity. Eighteen of 19 cancer samples clustered together (sensitivity 95%) while 27/36 of non-cancer samples clustered in a second group. Nine non-cancer samples that clustered with cancer samples included 5 pre-malignant lesions (1 adenomatous polyp and 4 intestinal metaplasia). Validation using a second sample set showed the sensitivity and specificity to be 88% and 93%, respectively. Positive predictive value of the combined data was 0.80. Selected peptide sequencing identified pepsinogen C and pepsin A activation peptide as significantly down-regulated and alpha-defensin as significantly up-regulated. CONCLUSION: This simple and reproducible multimarker proteomic assay could supplement clinical gastroscopic evaluation of symptomatic patients to enhance diagnostic accuracy for gastric cancer and pre-malignant lesions.","publish_time":"2008-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kon, Oi Lian; Yip, Tai-Tung; Ho, Meng Fatt; Chan, Weng Hoong; Wong, Wai Keong; Tan, Soo Yong; Ng, Wai Har; Kam, Siok Yuen; Eng, Alvin KH; Ho, Patrick; Viner, Rosa; Ong, Hock Soo; Kumarasinghe, M Priyanthi","journal":"BMC Med Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36885622f4e863ce69c521612093f1682fed1a5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2584050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18950519/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1755-8794-1-54","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multimarker"],"organizations":["Proteomic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gastric cancer samples","gastric cancer survival","non-cancer samples","gastric fluid samples","gastric cancers","Proteomic features","diagnostic proteomic fingerprints","Multi-protein profiling of gastric fluids","reproducible multimarker proteomic assay","distinctive proteomic profiles independent of age","pre-malignant lesions","Multimarker clustering","Protein profiles","benign gastritides patients","sensitivity","validation","significance analysyis of microarray","blinded sample set","diagnostic accuracy","significance analysis of microarray algorithm","activation peptide","reliable methods","two-way hierarchical clustering","Selected peptide sequencing","clinical gastroscopic evaluation of symptomatic patients","ionization time","pepsinogen C","flight mass spectrometry","adenomatous polyp","surface-enhanced laser desorption","gastroscopy","multiple ProteinChip arrays","anatomic site of pathology","curable early stage disease","Positive predictive value","combined data","elective","ethnicity","intestinal metaplasia","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","specificity","BACKGROUND","group","alpha-defensin"],"language":"en"},

Bio-tech approaches have been widely used for improved vaccines development. While many viral diseases are controlled through vaccination, many still lack safe and efficacious vaccines. Additional challenges faced by academia, industry and governments are likely to come from viruses jumping species and also from the emergence of virulent variants of established viruses due to natural mutations. Also viral ecology is changing as the respective vectors adapt to new habitats as has been shown in the recent incursion by bluetongue virus into Europe. In this paper the current vaccines for livestock, horses and birds are described in a species by species order. The new promising bio-tech approaches using reverse genetics, non-replicating viral vectors, alpha virus vectors and genetic vaccines in conjunction with better adjuvants and better ways of vaccine delivery are discussed as well.","publish_time":"2009-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, J.

Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays. Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene. Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA). Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses. Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR. Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5\u00D7107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0\u00D7104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P\u003C0.001). The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization. Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B. Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period. Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuypers, Jane; Wright, Nancy; Morrow, Rhoda","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/925d5841082b5d6b5973e29d771a135b9dc36120.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128826.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204001210; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204001210","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Washington Virology Laboratory","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subtype RSV","respiratory samples","subtyping RSV","quantity of RSV","RSV-B detection","samples positive","positive samples","real-time RT-PCR assays","Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples","respiratory specimens","Median RSV copy number","subtype-specific assay","indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay","quantitative assay","FA","common respiratory viruses","Respiratory syncytial virus","primers","gender","copies","hospitalization","major cause of lower respiratory tract morbidity","herpes viruses","younger age","clinical specimens","polymerase gene","matrix protein gene","young children","patient groups","similar viral loads","consensus region","quantifying","amplification","immunosuppressed patients","Abstract Background","University of Washington Virology Laboratory","Specificity","sensitive alternative","subtypes","Study design","Seattle cohort","Conclusions","specimen collection period","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

The patients\u2019 ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the postmortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients.

The burden is particularly severe in developing countries. Improved understanding of the source of infection, pathways of spread and persistence in communities would be of benefit in devising intervention strategies. Methods: We report epidemiological data obtained through surveillance of respiratory viruses at nine outpatient health facilities within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Kilifi County, coastal Kenya, between January and December 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from individuals of all ages presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms (up to 15 swabs per week per facility) and screened for 15 respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Paediatric inpatient surveillance at Kilifi County Hospital for respiratory viruses provided comparative data. Results: Over the year, 5,647 participants were sampled, of which 3,029 (53.7%) were aged \u003C5 years. At least one target respiratory virus was detected in 2,380 (42.2%) of the samples; the most common being rhinovirus 18.6% (1,050), influenza virus 6.9% (390), coronavirus 6.8% (387), parainfluenza virus 6.6% (371), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 3.9% (219) and adenovirus 2.7% (155). Virus detections were higher among \u003C5-year-olds compared to older children and adults (50.3% vs 32.7%, respectively; \u03C7 (2)(1) =177.3, P=0.0001). Frequency of viruses did not differ significantly by facility (\u03C7 (2)(8) =13.38, P=0.072). However, prevalence was significantly higher among inpatients than outpatients in \u003C5-year-olds for RSV (22.1% vs 6.0%; \u03C7 (2)(1) = 159.4, P=0.0001), and adenovirus (12.4% vs 4.4%, \u03C7 (2)(1) =56.6, P=0.0001). Conclusions: Respiratory virus infections are common amongst ARI outpatients in this coastal Kenya setting, particularly in young children. Rhinovirus predominance warrants further studies on the health and socio-economic implications. RSV and adenovirus were more commonly associated with severe disease.

They play roles in various biological processes. However, little is known about their evolutionary history and their functions in plant stress regulation. The availability of full genome sequences from various plant species makes it possible to perform a whole-genome exploration for further understanding their biological functions. RESULTS: Higher plant genomes encode large numbers of lectin proteins. Based on their domain structures and phylogenetic analyses, a new classification system has been proposed. In this system, 12 different families have been classified and four of them consist of recently identified plant lectin members. Further analyses show that some of lectin families exhibit species-specific expansion and rapid birth-and-death evolution. Tandem and segmental duplications have been regarded as the major mechanisms to drive lectin expansion although retrogenes also significantly contributed to the birth of new lectin genes in soybean and rice. Evidence shows that lectin genes have been involved in biotic/abiotic stress regulations and tandem/segmental duplications may be regarded as drivers for plants to adapt various environmental stresses through duplication followed by expression divergence. Each member of this gene superfamily may play specialized roles in a specific stress condition and function as a regulator of various environmental factors such as cold, drought and high salinity as well as biotic stresses. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide a new outline of the plant lectin gene superfamily and advance the understanding of plant lectin genes in lineage-specific expansion and their functions in biotic/abiotic stress-related developmental processes.","publish_time":"2010-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Shu-Ye; Ma, Zhigang; Ramachandran, Srinivasan","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95a67196304d99e8a705d765c70022219db7f718.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2846932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236552/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-79","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tandem"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lectin expansion","plant lectin members","lectin families","understanding of plant lectin genes","plant lectin gene superfamily","birth of new lectin genes","plant stress regulation","various plant species","large numbers of lectin proteins","Higher plant genomes","various environmental stresses","various biological processes","biotic stresses","biological functions","specific stress condition","abiotic stress regulations","lineage-specific expansion","new outline","regulator of various environmental factors","abiotic stress-related developmental processes","species-specific expansion","new classification system","segmental duplications","tandem","rapid birth","specialized roles","phylogenetic analyses","genome sequences","genome exploration","binding proteins","different families","drought","high salinity","drivers","soybean","class of carbohydrate","RESULTS","plants","major mechanisms","retrogenes","rice","expression divergence","domain structures","evolutionary history","Lectins","death evolution","studies","availability","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Evidence"],"language":"en"},

Results Totally, 1860 patients were screened and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection respectively. COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection group, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups.

One of the key challenges in designing maternal immunization trials is that developing exclusion criteria requires understanding and quantifying the background risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in the pregnancy being studied, which can occur independent of any intervention and be unrelated to vaccine administration. The Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GAIA) project has developed and published case definitions and guidelines for data collection, analysis, and evaluation of maternal immunization safety in trials involving pregnant women. Complementing this work, we sought to understand how to best assess obstetric risk of adverse outcomes and differentiate it from the assessment of vaccine safety. Quantification of obstetric risk is based on prior and current obstetric, and maternal medical history. We developed a step-wise approach to evaluate and quantify obstetric and maternal risk factors in pregnancy based on review of published literature and guidelines, and critically assessed these factors in the context of designing inclusion and exclusion criteria for maternal vaccine studies.

In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006/2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18.7%, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys. The highest prevalence was found in the diving ducks\u2014mainly Greater Scaup (Aythya marila; 51.5%)\u2014and the dabbling duck Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; 19.2%). Sequences from two of the Greater Scaup CoV fell into an infrequently detected lineage, shared only with a Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) CoV. Coronavirus sequences from Mallards in this study were highly similar to CoV sequences from the sample species and location in 2011, suggesting long-term maintenance in this population. A single Black-headed Gull represented the only positive sample from the order Charadriiformes. Globally, Anas species represent the largest fraction of avian CoV sequences, and there seems to be no host species, geographical or temporal structure. To better understand the eitiology, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected CoV is imperative.","publish_time":"2016-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Muradrasoli, Shaman; Nilsson, Anna; J\u00E4rhult, Josef D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b482a5e57ac1d83844e7204c907109483603516.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4777420.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26938459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tufted Duck"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["Greater Scaup CoV","overall CoV prevalence","sample species","avian species","largest fraction of avian CoV sequences","Anas species","subsequent sequencing of detected CoV","host species","Coronavirus sequences","systematic surveillance of wild birds","wide variety of wild","wild bird surveys","study","Coronaviruses","positive sample","Tufted Duck","Aythya fuligula","detected lineage","Anas platyrhynchos","Aythya marila","order Charadriiformes","highest prevalence","features of CoVs","dabbling duck Mallard","risk","evolution","ecology","distribution","domestic animals","diving ducks","orders Anseriformes","location","genetic diversity","emerging infectious disease","single Black-headed Gull","taxonomy","temporal structure","Mallards","Sweden","long-term maintenance","epidemiology","poultry","samples","population","eitiology"],"language":"en"},

To address this issue, we primed BALB/c mice either intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with varying doses of wild type (WT) human adenovirus subtype 5 (HAd5). Following the development of immunity against HAd5, we immunized animals via the i.n. or i.m. route of inoculation with a HAd vector (HAd-HA-NP) expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus. The immunogenicity and protection results suggest that low levels of vector immunity (\u003C520 virus-neutralization titer) induced by priming mice with up to 10(7) plaque forming units (p.f.u.) of HAd-WT did not adversely impact the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Furthermore, high levels of vector immunity (approximately 1500 virus-neutralization titer) induced by priming mice with 10(8) p.f.u. of HAd-WT were overcome by either increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination. A further increase in the priming dose to 10(9) p.f.u. allowed only partial protection. These results suggest possible strategies to overcome the variable levels of human immunity against adenoviruses, leading to better utilization of HAd vector-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pandey, Aseem; Singh, Neetu; Vemula, Sai V.; Cou\u00EBtil, Laurent; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Donis, Ruben; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Mittal, Suresh K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59f0dcb0a9c96b60a795162ec2230238896a96e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3303828.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22432020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low levels of vector immunity","high levels of vector immunity","development of immunity","variable levels of human immunity","priming mice","WT","adenovirus vector-based vaccines","priming dose","prevalence of preexisting immunity","virus-neutralization titer","adenoviruses","human adenovirus subtype","human population","HA-NP","c mice","influenza virus","protection results","HAd5","vaccine dose","partial protection","development of adaptive immune responses","varying doses of wild type","majority","better utilization","BALB","possible strategies","hemagglutinin","alternate routes of vaccination","Vietnam","H5N1","nucleoprotein","immunogenicity","animals","protective efficacy","route of inoculation","issue","increase","plaque","units"],"language":"en"},

Plus-strand (\u002B)RNA viruses have limited coding potential necessitating that they co-opt an unknown number of host factors to facilitate their replication in host cells. Global genomics and proteomics approaches performed with Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model host have led to the identification of 250 host factors affecting TBSV RNA replication and recombination or bound to the viral replicase, replication proteins, or the viral RNA. The roles of a dozen host factors involved in various steps of the replication process have been validated in yeast as well as a plant host. Altogether, the large number of host factors identified and the great variety of cellular functions performed by these factors indicate the existence of a truly complex interaction between TBSV and the host cell. This review summarizes the advantages of using a simple plant virus and yeast as a model host to advance our understanding of virus\u2013host interactions at the molecular and cellular levels. The knowledge of host factors gained can potentially be used to inhibit virus replication via gene silencing, expression of dominant negative mutants, or design of specific chemical inhibitors leading to novel specific or broad-range resistance and antiviral tools against (\u002B)RNA plant viruses.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagy, Peter D.; Pogany, Judit","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5fe5d689ac5132e4cb4b5e5330d8afe092e4634.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173251.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352710760048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20965073/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352710760048; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-3527(10)76004-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plant host","model host","host interactions","host cells","dozen host factors","knowledge of host factors","unknown number of host factors","large number of host factors","host cell metabolism","host defense mechanisms","virus replication","TBSV RNA replication","viral RNA","RNA plant viruses","yeast","replication proteins","replication process","success of RNA viruses","simple plant virus","understanding of virus","viral replicase","Tomato bushy stunt virus","viral infection cycle","cellular levels","design of specific chemical inhibitors","great variety of cellular functions","expression of dominant negative mutants","proteomics approaches","gene silencing","broad-range resistance","various steps","limited coding potential necessitating","recombination","antiviral tools","pathogens of plants","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","identification","complex interaction","animals","advantages","ability","Global genomics","humans","existence","roles","strand","review"],"language":"en"},

However, there is concern that the use of these gradual fill methods may increase the distress experienced by these animals. We evaluated social and anxiety behavior of rats that had been exposed to concentrations of CO(2) that did not cause a loss of consciousness. We also evaluated the physiologic changes of rats that were euthanized with gradual fill protocols as compared to rapid fill methods. We found that rats exposed to concentrations of CO(2) that did not cause a loss of consciousness did exhibit increased anxiety and decreased social behavior. We also found that the use of a 10% volume per minute displacement rate of CO(2) resulted in physiologic and behavioral changes suggestive of distress. ABSTRACT: Current recommendations for the use of CO(2) as a euthanasia agent for rats require the use of gradual fill protocols (such as 10% to 30% volume displacement per minute) in order to render the animal insensible prior to exposure to levels of CO(2) that are associated with pain. However, exposing rats to CO(2), concentrations as low as 7% CO(2) are reported to cause distress and 10%\u201320% CO(2) induces panic-associated behavior and physiology, but loss of consciousness does not occur until CO(2) concentrations are at least 40%. This suggests that the use of the currently recommended low flow volume per minute displacement rates create a situation where rats are exposed to concentrations of CO(2) that induce anxiety, panic, and distress for prolonged periods of time. This study first characterized the response of male rats exposed to normoxic 20% CO(2) for a prolonged period of time as compared to room air controls. It demonstrated that rats exposed to this experimental condition displayed clinical signs consistent with significantly increased panic-associated behavior and physiology during CO(2) exposure. When atmospheric air was then again delivered, there was a robust increase in respiration rate that coincided with rats moving to the air intake. The rats exposed to CO(2) also displayed behaviors consistent with increased anxiety in the behavioral testing that followed the exposure. Next, this study assessed the behavioral and physiologic responses of rats that were euthanized with 100% CO(2) infused at 10%, 30%, or 100% volume per minute displacement rates. Analysis of the concentrations of CO(2) and oxygen in the euthanasia chamber and the behavioral responses of the rats suggest that the use of the very low flow volume per minute displacement rate (10%) may prolong the duration of panicogenic ranges of ambient CO(2), while the use of the higher flow volume per minute displacement rate (100%) increases agitation. Therefore, of the volume displacement per minute rates evaluated, this study suggests that 30% minimizes the potential pain and distress experienced by the animal.","publish_time":"2016-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hickman, Debra L.; Fitz, Stephanie D.; Bernabe, Cristian S.; Caliman, Izabela F.; Haulcomb, Melissa M.; Federici, Lauren M.; Shekhar, Anantha; Johnson, Philip L.","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/417286ac22fc95bdfe96df0dc2a7c1e3eb5befe1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4997270.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490573/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani6080045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CO","7% CO","10%\u201320% CO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["volume displacement","anxiety behavior of rats","use of gradual","physiologic responses of rats","physiologic changes of rats","concentrations","minute displacement rates","minute rates","response of male rats","higher flow volume","recommended low flow volume","increased anxiety","increased panic-associated behavior","behavioral responses","behavioral changes suggestive of distress","social behavior","methods","study","loss of consciousness","exposure","respiration rate","behavioral testing","animal insensible","euthanasia agent","physiology","order","Current recommendations","euthanasia chamber","protocols","experience of pain","air intake","potential pain","atmospheric air","prolonged periods of time","prolonged period of time","room air controls","behaviors consistent","robust increase","clinical signs consistent","experimental condition","situation","SIMPLE SUMMARY","duration of panicogenic ranges of ambient","normoxic","levels","ABSTRACT","oxygen","agitation","animals","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

An airborne bioaerosol assessment study was carried out at a high traffic density junction focusing on their concentration, contribution in respirable particulate matter (PM), and factors influencing the distribution and microbial diversity. Andersen six-stage viable cascade impactor and a wide-range aerosol spectrometer were used for microbial and particulate matter measurements, respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between bioaerosol concentration, vehicular count, PM concentration, and meteorological parameters. The mean bacteria concentration (1962.95 \u00B1 651.85 CFU/m(3)) was significantly different than fungi (1118.95 \u00B1 428.34 CFU/m(3)) (p \u003C 0.05). The temporal distribution showed maximum concentration for bacteria and fungi during monsoon and postmonsoon seasons, respectively. In terms of bioaerosol loading, a considerable fraction of fungi (3.25%) and bacteria (5.65%) contributed to the total airborne PM. Most abundant bioaerosols were Aspergillus (27.58%), Penicillium (23%), and Cladosporium (14.05%) (fungi), and Micrococcus (25.73%), Staphylococcus (17.98%), and Bacillus (13.8%) (bacteria). Traffic-induced roadside soil resuspension and microbial aerosolizations from the human body were identified as the chief sources of bioaerosol emissions. The risk of lower respiratory tract infections caused by anthroponotic (human transmitted) transfer of bacterial pathogens is very high. The results of the study can be used to trace sources of microbial mediated communicable diseases, and to recommend appropriate safety measures to avoid pathogenic bioaerosol exposure.

Viral infection induced translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm that enabled GLTSCR2 to attenuate type I interferon IFN-\u03B2 and support viral replication. Cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 was able to interact with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), and the triple interaction induced USP15 activity to remove K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-\u03B2. Blocking cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2, by deletion of its nuclear export sequence (NES), abrogated its ability to attenuate IFN-\u03B2 and support viral replication. GLTSCR2-mediated attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-\u03B2 led to alleviation of host cell innate immune response to viral infection.

Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor\u2014angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\u2014for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel.

Radiologic abnormalities in sinuses occur, however, in most patients with upper respiratory virus infections. Objective: Assessment of the occurrence, clinical profile, laboratory findings, and outcome of radiologically confirmed sinusitis was carried out as part of a common cold study in young adults. Methods: Clinical examinations and radiography of the paranasal sinuses were carried out on days 1, 7, and 21 in 197 patients with the common cold. The symptoms were recorded on diary cards on days 1 to 20. Ten viruses and 5 bacteria were studied as etiologic agents of common cold as reported earlier. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and total white blood cell counts with differentials were determined in 40 randomized subjects on day 7. The effect of 6 days of intranasal fluticasone propionate treatment of the common cold in the prevention of sinusitis was analyzed. Results: On day 7, 39% of patients with the common cold in the placebo group (n = 98) had sinusitis, which we would prefer to call viral sinusitis. The symptoms of patients with sinusitis and those without it were not clinically distinguishable. Viral infection was detected in 81.6% of patients with sinusitis. No significantly increased levels of antibodies to bacteria were detected. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and white blood cell counts were low in patients with sinusitis. All patients made a clinical recovery within 21 days without antibiotic treatment. Fluticasone propionate treatment tended to prevent paranasal sinusitis, especially in rhinovirus-positive subjects. Conclusion: Viral sinusitis frequently occurs in the early days of the common cold, but it is a self-limited illness. The sinuses should not be imaged in patients with the common cold if the signs and symptoms of illness gradually become less severe and no specific signs suggestive of bacterial sinusitis occur.

In this study, both pathogenic (passage 3, P3) and attenuated (P110) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains were used to study the immune responses of chicken to IBV infection. Expression of avian \u03B2-defensins (AvBDs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in 16 tissues of chicken were compared at 7 days PI. The results showed that P3 infection upregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12, while P110 infection downregulated the expression of AvBDs, including AvBD3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 in most tissues. Meanwhile, the expression level of several TLRs showed a general trend of upregulation in the tissues of P3-infected chickens, while they were downregulated in the tissues of P110-infected chickens. The result suggested that compared with the P110 strain, the P3 strain induced a more pronounced host innate immune response. Furthermore, we observed that recombinant AvBDs (including 2, 6, and 12) demonstrated obvious anti-viral activity against IBV in vitro. Our findings contribute to the proposal that IBV infection induces an increase in the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of some AvBDs and TLRs, which suggests that AvBDs may play significant roles in the resistance of chickens to IBV replication.

These parasitic protists are usually transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route, following the ingestion of infective stages (oocysts or cysts). An essential component of the control of these parasitic infections, from a public health perspective, is an understanding of the sources and routes of transmission in different geographical regions. Bovines are considered potential sources of infection for humans, because species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infecting humans have also been isolated from cattle in molecular parasitological studies. However, species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia of bovids, and the extent of zoonotic transmission in different geographical regions in the world, are still relatively poorly understood. The purpose of this article is to (1) provide a brief background on Cryptosporidium and Giardia, (2) review some key aspects of the molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in animals, with an emphasis on bovines, (3) summarize research of Cryptosporidium and Giardia from cattle and water buffaloes in parts of Australasia and Sri Lanka, considering public health aspects and (4) provide a perspective on future avenues of study. Recent studies reinforce that bovines harbour Cryptosporidium and Giardia that likely pose a human health risk and highlight the need for future investigations of the biology, population genetics and transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in cattle, water buffaloes and other ruminants in different geographical regions, the fate and transport of infective stages following their release into the environment, as well as for improved strategies for the control and prevention of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, guided by molecular epidemiological studies.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abeywardena, Harshanie; Jex, Aaron R.; Gasser, Robin B.","journal":"Advances in Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0668fe56c1799401afedf1f9c1927d5f9e6338f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103119.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25911369/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065308X1500010X; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apar.2015.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X1500010X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australasia"],"keyphrases":["genotypes of Cryptosporidium","Giardia of bovids","research of Cryptosporidium","Abstract Cryptosporidium","transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium","Giardia infecting humans","bovines harbour Cryptosporidium","cattle","different geographical regions","public health aspects","public health perspective","molecular epidemiological studies","molecular parasitological studies","water buffaloes","giardiasis","routes of transmission","control","molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis","animals","species","Recent studies","extent of zoonotic transmission","transport of infective stages","ingestion of infective stages","human health risk","prevention of cryptosporidiosis","future investigations","key aspects","parasitic infections","parasitic protists","potential sources of infection","future avenues of study","biology","Sri Lanka","population genetics","common aetiological agents of infectious enteritis","need","parts of Australasia","fate","ruminants","understanding","oocysts","release","oral route","improved strategies","environment","emphasis","world","brief background","essential component","purpose","article"],"language":"en"},

Thus, there is a great need for the development of effective shorter drug regimens to improve clinical outcome and strengthen TB control. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is emerging as a novel adjunctive strategy to enhance the efficacy and shorten the duration of TB treatment. Previously, we showed that the administration of CC-3052, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE4i), reduced the host inflammatory response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and improved the antimicrobial efficacy of isoniazid (INH) in both the mouse and rabbit models. In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics and explored the mechanism underlying the efficacy of a more potent PDE4i, CC-11050, as adjunct to INH treatment in a mouse model of pulmonary Mtb infection. Genome-wide lung transcriptome analysis confirmed the dampening of inflammation and associated network genes that we previously reported with CC-3052. Consistent with the reduction in inflammation, a significant improvement in Mtb control and pathology was observed in the lungs of mice treated with CC-11050 plus INH, compared to INH alone.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and thereby influencing various physiological and pathological processes. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs act as key effector molecules in the complicated pathogen-host interactions. However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 infection and pathogenesis are not well understood. METHODS: To identify special miRNAs involved in EV71 infection, a microarray assay was performed to study the expression pattern of miRNAs in EV71-infected human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells) and uninfected RD cells. We further predicted the putative target genes for the dysregulated miRNAs using the online bioinformatic algorithms (TargetScan, miRanda and PicTar) and carried out functional annotation including GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis for miRNA predicted targets. Then, the results of microarray were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Totally, 45 differentially expressed miRNAs ware identified by microarray, among which 36 miRNAs were up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated. 7166 predicted target genes for the dysregulated miRNAs were revealed by using TargetScan in conjunction with miRanda and PicTar. The GO annotation suggested that predicted targets of miRNAs were enriched into the category of signal transduction, regulation of transcription, metabolic process, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process and immune response. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that these predicted target genes were involved in many important pathways, mainly including endocytosis and focal adhesion, MAPK signaling pathway, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, melanogenesis and ErbB signaling pathway. The expression levels of 8 most differentially up-regulated miRNAs and 3 most differentially down-regulated miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. The expressions of hsa-miR-4530, hsa-miR-4492, hsa-miR-6125, hsa-miR-494-3p, hsa-miR-638, hsa-miR-6743-5p, hsa-miR-4459 and hsa-miR-4443 detected by qRT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data. CONCLUSION: These results might extend our understanding to the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs underlying the pathogenesis of EV71 infection, thus strengthening the preventative and therapeutic strategies of HFMD caused by EV71.","publish_time":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xun, Meng; Ma, Chao-Feng; Du, Quan-Li; Ji, Yan-Hong; Xu, Ji-Ru","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27636c830ab9c45d38454d50312227747652f70e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4416288.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0288-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hsa-miR","dysregulated miRNAs","special miRNAs","roles of miRNAs","miRNAs ware","predicted targets of miRNAs","expression pattern of miRNAs","regulatory mechanism of miRNAs","expressions of hsa","pathogenesis of EV71 infection","predicted target genes","results of microarray","KEGG pathway analysis","microarray assay","microarray data","qRT-PCR","EV71-infected human rhabdomyosarcoma cells","putative target genes","uninfected RD cells","TargetScan","miRanda","PicTar","expression levels","quantitative RT-PCR","post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression","apoptotic process","metabolic process","regulation of transcription","important role","important pathways","functional annotation","key effector molecules","therapeutic strategies of HFMD","class of small non-coding RNA molecules","protein phosphorylation","foot","online bioinformatic algorithms","MAPK","hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","enrichment","major etiological pathogens of hand","endocytosis","focal adhesion","melanogenesis","preventative","complicated pathogen-host interactions","mouth disease","immune response","category of signal transduction","pulmonary complications","ErbB","understanding","fatality","pathological processes","conjunction","BACKGROUND","Enterovirus","METHODS","evidence","MicroRNAs","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. METHODS: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37\u201375]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\u00B72 log(10) copies per mL (IQR 4\u00B71\u20137\u00B70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope \u22120\u00B715, 95% CI \u22120\u00B719 to \u22120\u00B711; R(2)=0\u00B771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman\u0027s \u03C1=0\u00B748, 95% CI 0\u00B7074\u20130\u00B775; p=0\u00B7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R(2)\u003E0\u00B79). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. INTERPRETATION: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.

Extreme examples include the outbreak of hepatitis A and of viral gastroenteritis in Shanghai caused by shellfish harvested from a sewage-polluted estuary. Viruses predominantly associated with waterborne transmission are members of the group of enteric viruses that primarily infect cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and are excreted in the faeces of infected individuals. The viruses concerned are highly host specific, which implies that their presence in water environments is sound evidence of human faecal pollution. In some cases different strains of a viral species, or even different species of a viral genus, may infect animals. The extent of the host specificity of enteric viruses is such that it is used as a valuable tool to distinguish between faecal pollution of human and animal origin, or to identify the origin of faecal pollution. The hepatitis E virus may be the only meaningful exception to this rule, having strains that seem to infect both humans and certain animals, complying with the definition of a zoonosis. The potential risk of infection associated with respiratory viruses such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome in water environments cannot be ignored. However, there is sound reason to believe that treatment and disinfection processes recommended for the acceptable control of enteric viruses will also accommodate enveloped viruses with a substantial safety margin.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grabow, Wilhelm O.K.","journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d00d74e347082ea90844afd5b60d8dd435fd745f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132496.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706907170014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287590/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706907170014; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17001-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","enveloped viruses","group of enteric viruses","host specificity of enteric viruses","Publisher Summary Viruses","acceptable control of enteric viruses","faecal pollution of human","origin of faecal pollution","water environments","viral species","sound evidence of human faecal pollution","different species","viral gastroenteritis","viral genus","water-related diseases","cases different strains","waterborne transmission","sound reason","animal origin","outbreak of hepatitis","certain animals","major cause of waterborne","hepatitis E virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","influenza","shellfish","presence","members","disinfection processes","meaningful exception","treatment","substantial safety margin","cells","potential risk of infection","definition","Extreme examples","rule","Shanghai","humans","extent","valuable tool","sewage-polluted estuary","faeces of infected individuals","gastrointestinal tract","zoonosis"],"language":"en"},

It selectivity binds to Glc2-N-glycan and is involved in a glycoprotein quality control mechanism. Even though malectin may play a role in immunity, its role in innate immunity is not fully known. In the present study, we identified and characterized the malectin gene from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaMLEC). We analyzed sequence features, spatial expression levels, temporal expression profiles upon immune responses, bacterial and carbohydrate binding abilities and anti-viral properties to investigate the potential role of HaMLEC in innate immunity. The molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) were estimated to be 31.99 kDa and 5.17, respectively. The N-terminal signal peptide, malectin superfamily domain and C-terminal transmembrane region were identified from the amino acid sequence of HaMLEC. The close evolutionary relationship of HaMLEC with other teleosts was identified by phylogenetic analysis. According to quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, HaMLEC expression was observed in all the examined tissues and high expression was observed in the ovary and brain, compared to other tested tissues. Temporal expression of HaMLEC in liver and blood tissues were significant modulated upon exposure to immunogens Edwardasiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, polyinosinic:polycytidylic and lipopolysaccharide. The presence of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases were functionally confirmed by a bacterial binding assay. Anti-viral activity significantly reduced viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) replication in cells overexpressing HaMLEC. The observed results suggested that HaMLEC may have a significant role in innate immunity in Hippocampus abdominalis.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sellaththurai, Sarithaa; Shanaka, K.A.S.N.; Liyanage, D.

A combination of sensitive deep sequencing technology and computational algorithms is essential for virus surveillance, especially for characterizing novel- or distantly related virus strains. Here, we explore the use of profile Hidden Markov Model-defined Pfam protein domains (Pfam domains) encoded by new sequences as a Coronaviridae sequence classification tool. The encoded domains are used first in a triage to identify potential Coronaviridae sequences and then processed using a Random Forest method to classify the sequences to the Coronaviridae genus level. The application of this algorithm on Coronaviridae genomes assembled from agnostic deep sequencing data from surveillance of bats and rats in Dong Thap province (Vietnam) identified thirty-four Alphacoronavirus and eleven Betacoronavirus genomes.

Control cows (n = 15) were fed non-Se-fortified alfalfa hay (5.3 mg Se/head daily) plus a mineral supplement containing inorganic Se (3 mg Se/head daily). Med-Se (n = 15) and High-Se cows (n = 15) were fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay (27.6 and 57.5 mg Se/head daily, respectively); both groups received mineral supplement without added Se. Calves were randomly assigned to receive orally administered OVA at 12, 24, or 36 h of age. Calves that received their oral dose of OVA at 12 h of age had higher serum OVA concentrations across the first 48 h of life if born to High-Se cows compared to calves born to Control cows (P = 0.05), with intermediate values for calves born to Med-Se cows. Our results, using OVA as a model for passive transfer, suggest that if calves do not receive adequate colostrum to reach maximum pinocytosis, then supranutritional Se supplementation in beef cattle may improve passive transfer in their calves, if calves receive colostrum within the first 12 h of age.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Apperson, K.

Interactions among co-infecting species can have profound consequences, including changing parasite transmission dynamics, altering disease severity and confounding attempts at parasite control. Despite the importance of co-infection, there is currently no way to predict how different parasite species may interact with one another, nor the consequences of those interactions. Here, we demonstrate a method that enables such prediction by identifying two nematode parasite groups based on taxonomy and characteristics of the parasitological niche. From an understanding of the interactions between the two defined groups in one host system (wild rabbits), we predict how two different nematode species, from the same defined groups, will interact in co-infections in a different host system (sheep), and then we test this experimentally. We show that, as predicted, in co-infections, the blood-feeding nematode Haemonchus contortus suppresses aspects of the sheep immune response, thereby facilitating the establishment and/or survival of the nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis; and that the T. colubriformis-induced immune response negatively affects H. contortus. This work is, to our knowledge, the first to use empirical data from one host system to successfully predict the specific outcome of a different co-infection in a second host species. The study therefore takes the first step in defining a practical framework for predicting interspecific parasite interactions in other animal systems.","publish_time":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lello, Joanne; McClure, Susan J.; Tyrrell, Kerri; Viney, Mark E.","journal":"Proc Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f071bf96a0a2a1c4fc270a41ca7f4535f474ec5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5879626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540516/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.2610","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemonchus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different parasite species","nematode parasite groups","co-infections","host species","different co-infection","different nematode species","different host system","co-infecting species","interspecific parasite interactions","parasite control","importance of co-infection","defined groups","nematode Haemonchus contortus","nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis","changing parasite transmission dynamics","sheep immune response","profound consequences","disease severity","taxonomy","aspects","confounding attempts","specific outcome","characteristics","practical framework","blood","hosts","survival","animal systems","prediction","way","empirical data","wild rabbits","step","parasitological niche","establishment","parasites","knowledge","study","method","understanding"],"language":"en"},

Among the BNoVs examined, one Korean BNoV strain had the highest nucleotide (86.8%) and amino acid (99.1%) identity with the genotype 1 BNoV (GIII-1) strain, while the remaining 11 Korean BNoVs shared a higher nucleotide (88.0\u201390.5%) and amino acid (93.5\u201399.1%) identity with the genotype 2 BNoV (GIII-2) strains. The phylogenetic data for the nucleotide and amino acid sequences also demonstrated that one Korean BNoV strain clustered with GIII-1 but the remaining eleven strains clustered with GIII-2. In conclusion, BNoV infections are endemic and there are two distinct genotypes with GIII-2 being the main genotype circulating in the calf population in South Korea.","publish_time":"2007-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sang-Ik; Jeong, Cheol; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Park, Sung-Hee; Park, Su-Jin; Hyun, Bang-Hun; Yang, Dong-Kun; Kim, Sang-Ki; Kang, Mun-Il; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e75b016c69190df02216599064939066058c9ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117243.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507001472; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507001472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Germany","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["GIII","Korean BNoVs","Korean BNoV strain","genetic diversity of BNoVs","bovine torovirus","bovine groups","bovine coronavirus","RT-PCR","BNoV infections","bovine enteric Nebraska","prevalence of bovine norovirus","diarrheic fecal samples","nested PCR assays","diarrheic calves","diarrheic fecal specimens","bovine viral diarrhea virus","amino acid sequences","South Korea","higher nucleotide","highest nucleotide","main genotype","identity","strains","enteric pathogens","C rotaviruses","direct sequencing","partial RdRp region","calicivirus","calf population","study","Germany","Netherlands","Escherichia coli","phylogenetic data","England","distinct genotypes","conclusion","Abstract","USA"],"language":"en"},

A double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial was conducted investigating the use of low\u2010dose oral interferon alpha for preventing acute viral respiratory illnesses. METHODS: Two hundred healthy adults aged 18\u201375 years were enrolled and completed weekly health data questionnaires to monitor for symptoms and impact of respiratory illness. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against influenza and other common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Low\u2010dose oral IFN\u03B1 prophylaxis did not reduce the incidence or impact of acute respiratory illness (ARI) or the impact of illness on daily activities. Post hoc analysis of participant subgroups, however, identified significant reductions in the incidence of ARI reported by males, those aged 50 years or more and those who received the 2009 seasonal influenza vaccine. Interferon alpha prophylaxis had a significant impact on the reporting of moderate\u2010to\u2010severe feverishness by the study population. Seropositive participants in the IFN group were more likely to report asymptomatic or mild symptoms compared with those in the placebo group who were more likely to report stronger symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Low\u2010dose oral IFN\u03B1 prophylaxis was not effective in limiting the overall incidence of ARI in our study population. However, there was evidence that prophylaxis reduced the severity of symptoms and had a beneficial effect in some subpopulations, including those who received the 2009 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination.","publish_time":"2013-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bennett, Alayne L.; Smith, David W.; Cummins, Martin J.; Jacoby, Peter A.; Cummins, Joseph M.; Beilharz, Manfred W.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7802bcbf293fc8eeb1908c42afde34c8b5c773fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5781220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23398960/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12094","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of respiratory illness","impact of illness","Interferon alpha prophylaxis","dose oral IFN\u03B1 prophylaxis","impact of acute respiratory illness","dose oral interferon alpha","significant impact","severity of symptoms","mild symptoms","stronger symptoms","overall incidence of ARI","use of low","acute viral respiratory illnesses","common respiratory viruses","placebo group","study population","years","seasonal influenza vaccine","seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination","significant reductions","IFN group","weekly health data questionnaires","antibodies","severe feverishness","reporting of moderate","clinical trial","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","beneficial effect","known antiviral agent","analysis of participant subgroups","healthy adults","Seropositive participants","BACKGROUND","daily activities","males","Serum samples","METHODS","subpopulations","evidence"],"language":"en"},

However, most of these reports are epidemiological studies and do not investigate the clinical features of hMPV pneumonia. METHODS: Three independent outbreaks of hMPV occurred at separate LTCF for intellectually challenged and elderly residents. A retrospective evaluation of hMPV pneumonia and its clinical and radiological features was conducted using available medical records and data. RESULTS: In 105 hMPV infections, 49% of patients developed pneumonia. The median age of pneumonia cases was significantly higher than non-pneumonia cases (P \u003C .001). Clinical manifestations of hMPV pneumonia included high fever, wheezing in 43%, and respiratory failure in 31% of patients. An elevated number of white blood cells as well as increased levels of C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase, and both aspartate and alanine transaminases was also observed among pneumonia cases. Evaluation of chest imaging revealed proximal bronchial wall thickenings radiating outward from the hilum in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: The aforementioned characteristics should be considered as representative of hMPV pneumonia. Patients presenting with these features should have laboratory testing performed for prompt diagnosis.","publish_time":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karimata, Yosuke; Kinjo, Takeshi; Parrott, Gretchen; Uehara, Ayako; Nabeya, Daijiro; Haranaga, Shusaku; Higa, Futoshi; Tateyama, Masao; Miyagawa, Keiko; Kishaba, Tomoo; Otani, Kanako; Okamoto, Michiko; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Fujita, Jiro","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f70c62951796b62a7ce61fe4650939a5840c2ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107412.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["representative of hMPV pneumonia","clinical features of hMPV pneumonia","Clinical manifestations of hMPV pneumonia","retrospective evaluation of hMPV pneumonia","hMPV infections","non-pneumonia cases","patients","independent outbreaks of hMPV","median age of pneumonia cases","radiological features","separate LTCF","epidemiological studies","elderly residents","Evaluation of chest imaging","increased levels of C","reactive protein","proximal bronchial wall thickenings","creatine phosphokinase","long-term care facilities","elevated number of white blood cells","human metapneumovirus","available medical records","high fever","aspartate","laboratory testing","alanine transaminases","aforementioned characteristics","prompt diagnosis","data","hilum","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","reports","respiratory failure","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A quick-to-be-identified cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has prior use experiences in patients in order to resolve the current pandemic situation before it could become worsening. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is hereby applied to identify the marketed drugs with potential for treating COVID-19. Material and methods An AI platform was established to identify potential old drugs with anti-coronavirus activities by using two different learning databases; one consisted of the compounds reported or proven active against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and the other one containing the known 3C-like protease inhibitors. All AI predicted drugs were then tested for activities against a feline coronavirus in in vitro cell-based assay. These assay results were feedbacks to the AI system for relearning and thus to generate a modified AI model to search for old drugs again. Results After a few runs of AI learning and prediction processes, the AI system identified 80 marketed drugs with potential. Among them, 8 drugs (bedaquiline, brequinar, celecoxib, clofazimine, conivaptan, gemcitabine, tolcapone, and vismodegib) showed in vitro activities against the proliferation of a feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in Fcwf-4 cells. In addition, 5 other drugs (boceprevir, chloroquine, homoharringtonine, tilorone, and salinomycin) were also found active during the exercises of AI approaches. Conclusion Having taken advantages of AI, we identified old drugs with activities against FIP coronavirus. Further studies are underway to demonstrate their activities against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo at clinically achievable concentrations and doses. With prior use experiences in patients, these old drugs if proven active against SARS-CoV-2 can readily be applied for fighting COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ke, Yi-Yu; Peng, Tzu-Ting; Yeh, Teng-Kuang; Huang, Wen-Zheng; Chang, Shao-En; Wu, Szu-Huei; Hung, Hui-Chen; Hsu, Tsu-An; Lee, Shiow-Ju; Song, Jeng-Shin; Lin, Wen-Hsing; Chiang, Tung-Jung; Lin, Jiunn-Horng; Sytwu, Huey-Kang; Chen, Chiung-Tong","journal":"Biomedical journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e8e38f33035fd67b4e603ff02814ef1c112375d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2020.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2319417020300494; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2319417020300494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AI system","marketed drugs","potential old drugs","AI platform","advantages of AI","runs of AI learning","SARS-CoV","modified AI model","exercises of AI approaches","anti-coronavirus activities","feline coronavirus","FIP coronavirus","prior use experiences","patients","influenza virus","assay results","ongoing COVID","human immunodeficiency virus","current pandemic situation","feline infectious peritonitis","different learning databases","cell-based assay","order","clofazimine","celecoxib","prediction processes","gemcitabine","conivaptan","boceprevir","homoharringtonine","brequinar","therapeutic medicine","feedbacks","tilorone","tolcapone","Fcwf","chloroquine","proliferation","relearning","compounds","Abstract Background","protease inhibitors","disease","deaths","salinomycin","vismodegib","Artificial intelligence","technology","Material","methods","achievable concentrations","doses","past","months","cells","studies","Conclusion","addition","cure"],"language":"en"},

This study examined 475 fecal samples from 143 farms located in 6 provinces across South Korea. RT-PCR and nested PCR utilizing primer pairs specific for the GARV VP6 gene detected GARV-positive reactions in 182 (38.3%) diarrheic fecal samples. A total of 98 porcine GARV strains isolated from the GARV-positive feces were analyzed for G and P genotyping. Based on the sequence and phylogenetic analyses, the most predominant combination of G and P genotypes was G5P[7], found in 63 GARV strains (64.3%). The other combinations of G and P genotypes were G8P[7] (16 strains [16.3%]), G9P[7] (7 strains [7.1%]), G9P[23] (2 strains [2.0%]), and G8P[1] (1 strain [1.0%]). The counterparts of G or P genotypes were not determined in three G5, five P[7], and one P[1] strains. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Korean G9 strains were more closely related to lineage VI porcine and human viruses than to other lineages (I\u2013V) of GARVs and to Korean human G9 strains (lineage III). These results show that porcine GARV infections are common in diarrheic piglets in South Korea. The infecting strains are genetically diverse, and include homologous (G5P[7]), heterologous (G8P[1]), and reassortant (G8P[7]), as well as emerging G9 GARV strains.","publish_time":"2010-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Park, Sang-Ik; Ha, Thi Phuong Mai; Jeong, Young-Ju; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Kwon, Hyoung-Jun; Kang, Mun-Il; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Park, Su-Jin","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3487c94e4f80b43ee541b21249b1885a20f34ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117351.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20359834/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.01.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113510000556; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113510000556","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GARV","G and P"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["porcine GARV strains","emerging G9 GARV strains","infecting strains","Korean G9 strains","porcine GARV infections","P genotypes","Korean human G9 strains","G8P","GARV-positive reactions","GARV-positive feces","P genotyping","GARV VP6 gene","combinations of G","counterparts of G","predominant combination of G","Abstract Porcine group","heterologous infections","South Korea","diarrheic fecal samples","G5P","G9P","nested PCR","diarrheic piglets","RT-PCR","human viruses","phylogenetic analyses","phylogenetic analysis","primer pairs specific","economic impact","potential","GARVs","swine industry","farms","rotavirus","important animal pathogen","lineages","provinces","humans","results","total","sequence","study","reassortant"],"language":"en"},

Antigenic peptides selected by pathogen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC; or human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules, and HLA-A restricted responses may be of interest for vaccine development and the understanding of cellular immunity. A series of peptides derived from the 10-KDa culture filtrate protein (CFP10) and the 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have been screened and a CTL epitope restricted by the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A24, a common HLA allele in Asian people, has been identified. In this study, we studied a panel of CFP10 and ESAT-6-derived peptides to identify those with binding motifs for HLA-A24 molecules. The antigenicity of candidate peptides was assessed with in vitro refolding tests and an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, and by tetramer staining to determine the capacity to stimulate CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A24-positive TB Patients. We report that one novel candidate peptide at positions 5\u201314 of ESAT-6 of Mtb could induce peptide-specific CTLs from PBMCs of HLA-A24-positive patients, but not from HLA-A24-negative patients and HLA-A24-positive healthy controls. Identified epitope is a weak binder for HLA-A24 molecule in a mini MHC refolding assay.

HPeV1 VP1 C terminus contains an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif and has been shown to depend on the host cell surface \u03B1V integrins (\u03B1V ITGs) and heparan sulfate (HS) for entry. HPeV3 lacks this motif and the receptors remain unknown. HPeVs can be detected in patient nasopharyngeal and stool samples, and infection is presumed to occur after respiratory or gastro-intestinal transmission. HPeV pathogenesis is poorly understood as there are no animal models and previous studies have been conducted in immortalized monolayer cell cultures which do not adequately represent the characteristics of human tissues. To bridge this gap, we determined the polarity of infection, replication kinetics, and cell tropism of HPeV1 and HPeV3 in the well-differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) model. We found the HAE cultures to be permissive for HPeVs. Both HPeV genotypes infected the HAE preferentially from the basolateral surface while the progeny virus was shed toward the apical side. Confocal microscopy revealed the target cell type to be the p63(\u002B) basal cells for both viruses, \u03B1V ITG and HS blocking had no effect on the replication of either virus, and transcriptional profiling suggested that HPeV3 infection induced stronger immune activation than HPeV1.

A porcine sapovirus Cowden strain, a member of genus Sapovirus within the Caliciviridae family, induces strong COX-2/PGE(2) but transient COX-1/PGE(2) signaling to enhance virus replication. However, whether infections of other viruses in the different genera activate COXs/PGE(2) signaling, and thus affect the replication of viruses, remains unknown. In the present study, infections of cells with the feline calicivirus (FCV) F9 strain in the genus Vesivirus and murine norovirus (MNV) CW-1 strain in the genus Norovirus only activated the COX-2/PGE(2) signaling in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors or transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against COX-2 enzyme significantly reduced the production of PGE(2) as well as FCV and MNV replications. The inhibitory effects of these pharmacological inhibitors against COX-2 enzyme on the replication of both viruses were restored by the addition of PGE(2). Silencing of COX-1 via siRNAs and inhibition of COX-1 via an inhibitor also decrease the production of PGE(2) and replication of both viruses, which can be attributed to the inhibition COX-1/PGE(2) signaling pathway. These data indicate that the COX-2/PGE(2) signaling pathway has proviral effects for the replication of FCV and MNV, and pharmacological inhibitors against these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic candidates for treating FCV and MNV infections.","publish_time":"2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Park, Jun-Gyu; Kim, Ji-Yun; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Sang-Ik; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c6fefd5a9ce1f7df6a863b7d91410d03bfc9139.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6051663.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021004/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200726","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COX","PGE","FCV","MNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of PGE","addition of PGE","inhibition of COX","inhibition COX","strong COX","transient COX","Silencing of COX","replication of FCV","replication of viruses","MNV infections","virus replication","pharmacological inhibitors","COXs","genus Norovirus","MNV replications","proviral effects","F9 strain","genus Vesivirus","member of genus Sapovirus","siRNAs","infections of cells","antiviral effects","inhibitory effects","virus family","pathways","porcine sapovirus Cowden strain","murine norovirus","Caliciviridae family","different genera","transfection of small interfering RNAs","feline calicivirus","potential therapeutic candidates","enzymes","CW","prostaglandin E","variety of homeostatic processes","various pathophysiological conditions","Cyclooxygenases","present study","Treatment","time-dependent manner","data"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: To determine the impact of CCL2 in inflammation in vivo and to elucidate the CCL2-induced polarization of activated brain microglia, we delivered CCL2 into the brains of wild-type mice via recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV-9) driven by the chicken \u03B2-actin promoter. We measured microglial activation using histological and chemical measurement and recruitment of monocytes using histology and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The overexpression of CCL2 in the CNS induced significant activation of brain resident microglia. CD45 and major histocompatibility complex class II immunoreactivity significantly increased at the sites of CCL2 administration. Histological characterization of the microglial phenotype revealed the elevation of \u201Cclassically activated\u201D microglial markers, such as calgranulin B and IL-1\u03B2, as well as markers associated with \u201Calternative activation\u201D of microglia, including YM1 and arginase 1. The protein expression profile in the hippocampus demonstrated markedly increased levels of IL-6, GM-CSF and eotaxin (CCL-11) in response to CCL2, but no changes in the levels of other cytokines, including TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis confirmed increases in mRNA levels of gene transcripts associated with neuroinflammation following CCL2 overexpression. Finally, we investigated the chemotactic properties of CCL2 in vivo by performing adoptive transfer of bone marrow\u2013derived cells (BMDCs) isolated from donor mice that ubiquitously expressed green fluorescent protein. Flow cytometry and histological analyses indicated that BMDCs extravasated into brain parenchyma and colabeled with microglial markers. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that CCL2 strongly activates resident microglia in the brain. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory activation of microglia were prominent, with no bias toward the M1 or M2 phenotype in the activated cells. As expected, CCL2 overexpression actively recruited circulating monocytes into the CNS. Thus, CCL2 expression in mouse brain induces microglial activation and represents an efficient method for recruitment of peripheral macrophages.","publish_time":"2013-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selenica, Maj-Linda B; Alvarez, Jennifer A; Nash, Kevin R; Lee, Daniel C; Cao, Chuanhai; Lin, Xiaoyang; Reid, Patrick; Mouton, Peter R; Morgan, Dave; Gordon, Marcia N","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a11eb58857b227cdd846083d87304eef58b52ac2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3726363.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-10-86; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23866683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpression of CCL2","CCL2 overexpression","CCL2 expression","impact of CCL2","microglial activation","CCL2-induced polarization of activated brain microglia","sites of CCL2 administration","chemotactic properties of CCL2","microglial markers","anti-inflammatory activation of microglia","significant activation of brain resident microglia","microglial phenotype","mouse brain","alternative activation","brain parenchyma","CNS","recruitment of monocytes","activated cells","increased levels of IL","macrophage recruitment","BMDCs","recruitment of peripheral macrophages","histological analyses","protein expression profile","Histological characterization","flow cytometry","RESULTS","C-C motif","monocyte chemoattractant protein","green fluorescent protein","type mice","mRNA levels of gene transcripts","donor mice","derived cells","M2 phenotype","circulating monocytes","recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype","chicken \u03B2-actin promoter","increases","migration","central nervous system","chemical measurement","adoptive transfer of bone marrow","hippocampus","efficient method","immunoreactivity","major histocompatibility complex class","bias","brains of wild","histology","calgranulin B","neuroinflammation","real-time PCR analysis","TNF-\u03B1","GM-CSF","CD45","cytokines","chemokine","changes","ligand","IFN-\u03B3","eotaxin","rAAV","response","YM1","elevation","BACKGROUND","arginase","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The most characteristic findings and the pending controversies were derived from a literature review and previous personal experiences. A single paragraph focused on some atypical examples of the disease presenting under confounding pretences. RESULTS: Headache, visual field alterations and impaired pituitary secretion are the most frequent clinical findings of the disease. Pituitary biopsy, still considered the gold diagnostic standard, does not always receive consent from the patients. The role of magnetic resonance imaging is limited, as this disease may generate images similar to those of other diseases. The role of antipituitary and antihypothalamus antibodies is still discussed owing to methodological difficulties and also because the findings on the true pituitary antigen(s) are still debated. However, the low sensitivity and specificity of immunofluorescence, one of the more widely employed methods to detect these antibodies, may be improved, considering a predetermined cut-off titre and a particular kind of immunostaining. CONCLUSION: Autoimmune hypophysitis is a multifaceted disease, which may certainly be diagnosed by pituitary biopsy. However, the possible different clinical, laboratory and imaging features must be considered by the physician to avoid a misdiagnosis when examining a possibly affected patient. Therapeutic choice has to be made taking into account the clinical conditions and the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary involvement, but also considering that spontaneous remissions can occur.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bellastella, Giuseppe; Maiorino, Maria Ida; Bizzarro, Antonio; Giugliano, Dario; Esposito, Katherine; Bellastella, Antonio; De Bellis, Annamaria","journal":"Pituitary","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9c8aa3f420dfd7c346234791ed46a15824cab49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pituitary biopsy","pituitary involvement","frequent clinical findings","characteristic findings","multifaceted disease","impaired pituitary secretion","true pituitary antigen","features of autoimmune hypophysitis","clinical conditions","imaging features","METHODS","cancer immunotherapy- related hypophysitis","role of magnetic resonance imaging","antihypothalamus antibodies","role of antipituitary","visual field alterations","literature review","degree of hypothalamic","Headache","IgG4","laboratory","atypical examples","pending controversies","particular kind of immunostaining","predetermined cut-off titre","previous personal experiences","RESULTS","owing","accepted knowledges","methodological difficulties","gold diagnostic standard","low sensitivity","specificity of immunofluorescence","publication","single paragraph","account","images similar","CONCLUSION","confounding pretences","misdiagnosis","consent","diseases","PURPOSE","forms","physician","spontaneous remissions","Therapeutic choice","patients"],"language":"en"},

Villous atrophy, diffuse necrosis, and flattening of mucosal epithelial cells were found in the ilea of examined piglets, and coccidian parasites were found in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. In some merozoites in the meronts, the presence of two nuclei indicated type 1 merozoites, characteristic of C. suis. According to Cystoisospora-specific PCR targeting the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) gene, the sequences of the products were 98.5% similar to those of C. suis. Escherichia coli (O149 serogroup) exhibiting a virulence factor profile (LT, STb, and EAST1 as toxins and F4 as a colonization factor) was detected in one piglet. No other bacteria or significant enteric viruses were found.

The risk of infection spreading in their home country is then estimated supposing the visitors are submitted to the same force of infection as the local population but do not contribute to it. In the second model (disease exportation), it is calculated the probability that an individual from the endemic (or epidemic) country travels to a disease-free country in the condition of latent infected and eventually introduces the infection there. The input of both models is the force of infection at the visited/source country, assumed known. The models are deterministic, but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented as an appendix.

This unique strategy was employed in addressing the off-target toxicity of Gsk3\u03B2 and CDKs. The connections of Gsk3\u03B2 in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the extensive potency of Gsk3\u03B2 inhibitors to block cell death have made it a potential drug-discovery target for many grievous human disorders. Gsk3\u03B2 is phylogenetically very closely related to the CDKs, such as CDK1 and CDK2, which are suggested to be the off-target proteins of Gsk3\u03B2 inhibitors. Here, we have employed novel computational approaches in designing the ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory against Gsk3\u03B2, with well-defined the exclusion ability to CDKs. A structure-ligand -based selective pharmacophore was modeled. This model was used to retrieve molecules from the zinc database. The hits retrieved were further screened by molecular docking and protein\u2013ligand interaction fingerprints.

The synonymous codon usage patterns based on the geographical regions of African countries showed broad distributions; when all the other regions, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, were taken into account, the Asian countries tended to be divided into two groups. The sequences were clustered into nine non-CRF subtypes. Among these, subtype C showed the most distinct codon usage pattern. To determine why the codon usage patterns in Asian countries were divided into two groups for four target genes, the sequences of the isolates from the Asian countries were analyzed. As a result, the synonymous codon usage patterns among Asian countries were divided into two groups, the southern Asian countries and the other Asian countries, with subtype 01_AE being the most dominant subtype in southern Asia. In summary, the synonymous codon usage patterns among the individual HIV-1 subtypes reflect genetic variations, and this bioinformatics technique may be useful in conjunction with phylogenetic methods for predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.","publish_time":"2006-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahn, Insung; Son, Hyeon Seok","journal":"Exp Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fde39e930c859c2d7d887cfb06eb0ee6518d688d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090625/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV Sequence Database"],"locations":["Europe","Asia","southern Asia"],"keyphrases":["synonymous codon usage patterns","southern Asian countries","relative synonymous codon usage","sequences","distinct codon usage pattern","groups","geographical regions of African countries","dominant subtype","subtype C","HIV Sequence Database","individual HIV","evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses","genomic properties of HIV","gp41 genes","target genes","non-CRF subtypes","RSCU","capsid","genetic variations","values of matrix","conjunction","bioinformatics technique","country","year","phylogenetic methods","broad distributions","sampling region","gp120","AE","isolates","result","summary","Americas","correspondence analysis","Europe","account","study"],"language":"en"},

C57BL/6N mice (7-week-old) were divided into four groups. Each group composed of control, dextran sodium sulfate-treated (DSS), C. rodentium-infected (CT), and DSS-treated and C. rodentium-infected (DSS-CT) mice. The DSS group was administered 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. The CT group was supplied with normal drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The DSS-CT group was supplied with 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The mice were sacrificed 10 days after the induction of C. rodentium infection. The DSS-CT group displayed significantly shorter colon length, higher spleen to body weight ratio, and higher histopathological score compared to the other three groups. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and interferon (INF)-\u03B3 were significantly upregulated; however, those of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were significantly downregulated in the DSS-CT group than in the control group. These results demonstrated that a combination of low DSS concentration (1%) and C. rodentium infection could effectively induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. This may potentially be used as a novel IBD model, in which colitis is induced in mice by the combination of a chemical and a pathogen.

There is an available vaccination program for preventing rotavirus infection, but it has limits and restrictions. Probiotics therapy could be an alternative method of antiviral prevention and modulation against rotavirus infection. In this study, we screened the antiviral activity of probiotic bacteria such as 3 Lactobacillus spp. and 14 Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from young Korean. Three of the bacteria, Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211, Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205, and SPM1206, inhibited human strain Wa rotavirus infection in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, these bacterial strains inhibited rotavirus replication in a rotavirus-infected neonatal mouse model. To clarify the mechanism of inhibition, we investigated gene expression of Interferon (IFN)-signaling components and IFN-inducible antiviral effectors. All 3 probiotics increased IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2 levels compared with the control. Gene expression of IFNsignaling components and IFN-inducible antiviral effectors also increased. Overall, these results indicate that L. ruminis SPM0211, B. longum SPM1205 and 1206 efficiently inhibit rotavirus replication in vitro and in vivo. Especially, the antiviral effect of Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211 is worthy of notice. This is the first report of L. ruminis with antiviral activity. Anti-rotaviral effects of the 3 probiotics are likely due to their modulation of the immune response through promoting type I IFNs, which are key regulators in IFN signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2015-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Joo Yeon; Lee, Do Kyung; Ha, Nam Joo; Shin, Hea Soon","journal":"J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61803c63a48fdddedfd407f8d440fe6b19b4a238.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rotavirus replication","IFN-inducible antiviral effectors","IFN-\u03B1","antiviral effect of Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211","antiviral activity of probiotic bacteria","IFN-\u03B2 levels","human strain Wa rotavirus infection","alternative method of antiviral prevention","rotavirus-infected neonatal mouse model","Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205","modulation","Probiotics therapy","Gene expression of IFNsignaling components","gene expression of Interferon","severe diarrhea","young children","young Korean","worldwide cause of severe gastroenteritis","fatal dehydration","SPM1206","infants","Caco","key regulators","worthy of notice","type","immune response","available vaccination program","bacterial strains","Anti-rotaviral effects","pathway","cells","report of","mechanism of inhibition","control","study","results","restrictions"],"language":"en"},

It was observed that dietary low or super-nutritional Se did not make renal appearance pathological changes in chicken. Low Se significantly reduced total antioxidant capability (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) content, but malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the kidney increased and decreased glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity with changes in their mRNA levels. Super-nutritional Se (3.0 mg/kg) increased T-AOC and GSH contents then made them reduce, but it reduced MDA content significantly, elevated then reduced Gpx activity, and decreased TrxR activity with changes in their mRNA levels. Dietary low Se downregulated the mRNA expressions of Gpx1-4, Txnrd3, Sepn1, Selw, Sepx1, Selh, and SEPSECS.

The detection system is based on a combined surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and fluorescent molecular beacon assay that is assembled on Nanobarcodes\u2122 particles. In this assay, a molecular beacon probe terminated with a fluorescent Raman label dye is conjugated to the metallic Nanobarcodes\u2122 particles. The molecular beacon probe is a single-stranded oligonucleotide that has been designed with a hairpin structure that holds the dye at 3\u2032-end close to the particle surface when the probe is attached through a 5\u2032-thiol group. In this configuration, the SERS spectrum of the label was obtained and its fluorescence quenched because the dye is in very close proximity to a noble metal surface with nanoscale features (Nanobarcodes\u2122 particles). The SERS signal decreased and the fluorescence signal increased when target viral RNA was captured by this molecular beacon probe. In addition, a hepatitis C virus reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (HCV RT-PCR) product was detected using this dual-mode beacon. The development of a multiplexed, label-free assay system with the reassurance offered by detection of two distinctly separate signals offers significant benefits for rapid molecular diagnostics.","publish_time":"2007-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sha, M.

The purified lectin was shown to have an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa by gel filtration and 13 kDa by SDS-PAGE, indicating that it is probably a dimer with two identical subunits. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of NTL as determined by molecular cloning also reveals that NTL protein contains a mature polypeptide consisting of 105 amino acids and a C-terminal peptide extension. Three-dimensional modelling study demonstrated that the NTL primary polypeptide contains three subdomains, each with a conserved mannose-binding site. It shows a high homology of about 60%\u201380% similarity with the existing monocot mannose-binding lectins. NTL could significantly inhibit plaque formation by the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with an IC(50) of 2.30 \u00B5g/ml and exhibit strong antiviral properties against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) and influenza B viruses with IC(50) values ranging from 0.20 \u00B5g/ml to 1.33 \u00B5g/ml in a dose-dependent manner. It is worth noting that the modes of antiviral action of NTL against RSV and influenza A virus are significantly different. NTL is effective in the inhibition of RSV during the whole viral infection cycle, but the antiviral activity of NTL is mainly expressed at the early stage of the viral cycle of influenza A (H1N1) virus. NTL with a high selective index (SI=CC(50)/IC(50)\u2265141) resulting from its potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity demonstrates a potential for biotechnological development as an antiviral agent.","publish_time":"2010-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ooi, Linda S.

The worldwide presence of HBoV in children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) has been confirmed. This study aimed to understand the prevalence and clinical features of HBoV in children with ARTI in Shanghai and explore the causative implication of HBoV in ARTI. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 349 hospitalized children with ARTI between November 2006 and January 2007. From these children, 351 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected; 325 of the samples were obtained from those with community-acquired ARTI and 26 from those with hospital-acquired ARTI. All samples were routinely screened for seven common respiratory viruses by immunofluorescence and further tested for HBoV by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 16 (4.6%) of the 351 samples, and it was the second most commonly detected virus after respiratory syncytial virus. Three (19%) HBoV-positive samples were dual infection with respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus type 3. Of the 325 children with community-acquired ARTI, HBoV was identified to be positive in 11 (3.4%), of whom 6 were diagnosed with pneumonia with patchy or interstitial infiltrates in the lung indicated by chest radiography, 3 with bronchitis, and 2 with bronchial asthma exacerbation with attendant lung infection. Out of the 26 children with nosocomial ARTI, 5 (19.2%) had bronchitis which was found to be HBoV positive without co-detection of other viruses. The HBoV-positive children were aged 1.7 months to 43 months and their mean age was 13.7 months. Sixteen (100%) children had cough, 11 (68.8%) had wheezing, and 10 (62.5%) had fever. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV was circulating in Shanghai during the study period, and which was detected frequently in children with ARTI. HBoV was found to be associated with community-acquired ARTI and may play a pathogenic role in nosocomial ARTI.","publish_time":"2010-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Mei; Zhu, Qi-Rong; Wang, Xiao-Hong; Yu, Hui; Shen, Jun","journal":"World J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03ca8647a9d984270ae2ab7d34a12f70546a068d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["HBoV-positive children","HBoV positive","HBoV-positive samples","nosocomial ARTI","hospitalized children","clinical features of HBoV","causative implication of HBoV","worldwide presence of HBoV","detected virus","respiratory syncytial virus","months","community","common respiratory viruses","acute respiratory tract infection","nasopharyngeal aspirate samples","dual infection","attendant lung infection","parainfluenza virus type","Shanghai","bronchitis","study period","bronchial asthma exacerbation","interstitial infiltrates","prevalence","medical records","co-detection","immunofluorescence","pathogenic role","chest radiography","mean age","pneumonia","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","polymerase chain reaction","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","cough","RESULTS","fever"],"language":"en"},

In this report we examined the contribution of IFN-inducible phosphorylation-activation of specific signaling effectors to protection from infection by a SARS-related murine coronavirus, MHV-1. As anticipated, the earliest receptor-activation event, Jak1 phosphorylation, is critical for IFN-inducible protection from MHV-1 infection. Additionally, we provide evidence for the contribution of two kinases, the MAP kinase p38MAPK, and protein kinase C (PKC) \u03B4 to antiviral protection from MHV-1 infection. Notably, our data suggest that MHV-1 infection, as for the Urbani SARS coronoavirus, inhibits an IFN response, inferred from the lack of activation of pkr and 2\u20325\u2032-oas, genes associated with mediating the antiviral activities of IFN-\u03B1s. To identify potential target genes that are activated downstream of the IFN-inducible signaling effectors we identified, and that mediate protection from coronavirus infection, we examined the gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SARS patients who received IFN treatment.

Although increased dead-space ventilation (V(D)/V(T)) has been described in ARDS, its mechanism is not clearly understood. We sought to evaluate the relationships between dynamic variations in V(D)/V(T) and extra-pulmonary microcirculatory blood flow detected at sublingual mucosa hypothesizing that an altered microcirculation, which is a generalized phenomenon during severe inflammatory conditions, could influence ventilation/perfusion mismatching manifested by increases in V(D)/V(T) fraction during early stages of ARDS. METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with early moderate and severe ARDS were included. PEEP was set targeting the best respiratory-system compliance after a PEEP-decremental recruitment maneuver. After 60 min of stabilization, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded and blood gases collected. V(D)/V(T) was calculated from the CO(2) production ([Formula: see text] ) and CO(2) exhaled fraction ([Formula: see text] ) measurements by volumetric capnography. Sublingual microcirculatory images were simultaneously acquired using a sidestream dark-field device for an ulterior blinded semi-quantitative analysis. All measurements were repeated 24 h after. RESULTS: Percentage of small vessels perfused (PPV) and microcirculatory flow index (MFI) were inverse and significantly related to V(D)/V(T) at baseline (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212 0.76 and \u2212 0.63, p \u003C 0.001; R(2) = 0.63, and 0.48, p \u003C 0.001, respectively) and 24 h after (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212 0.71, and \u2212 0.65; p \u003C 0.001; R(2) = 0.66 and 0.60, p \u003C 0.001, respectively). Other respiratory, macro-hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters did not correlate with V(D)/V(T). Variations in PPV between baseline and 24 h were inverse and significantly related to simultaneous changes in V(D)/V(T) (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212 0.66, p \u003C 0.001; R(2) = 0.67, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: Increased heterogeneity of microcirculatory blood flow evaluated at sublingual mucosa seems to be related to increases in V(D)/V(T), while respiratory mechanics and oxygenation parameters do not.

There are few studies in adults assessing the incidence of RTI in patients hospitalized with acute asthma. AIM: To document the incidence of RTI in adults hospitalized with acute asthma. METHODS: A prospective study of patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Hospital Footscray, over a 12-month period. A control group was studied from elective surgical inpatients. Patients were investigated with serologic tests for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and influenza A and R. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were cultured for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and herpes simplex virus. If sputum was available, it was assessed with microscopy and culture. Rlood cultures were taken if patients were febrile and all patients had a chest radiograph. Control subjects completed serologic tests and NPA. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (33 male and 46 female) and 54 control subjects (26 male and 28 female) were studied. Two patients were enrolled twice. Mean (\u00B1SD) age of patients was 35 \u00B115 years (range, 16 to 66 years), and mean age of control subjects was 37\u00B115 years (range, 18 to 69 years). In the patient group, 29 (37%) had evidence of recent RTI of which 23 were viral. Five of the control subjects (9%) had evidence of recent RTI (p\u003C0.001). Twenty-four patients were positive on serologic and/or NPA culture. Five patients had positive serologic test results and/or NPA culture to two or more agents. Two patients tested positive on sputum, radiograph, and temperature criteria. Three patients tested positive on the basis of radiographic evidence of consolidation, blood neutrophilia, and temperature. Influenza A (13) and rhinovirus (9) were the most common infectious agents. Other agents identified were RSV (one), influenza R (two), adenovirus (one), and Mycoplasma (one). Influenza and rhinovirus infections occurred predominantly in late and early winter, respectively.

According to the World Health Organization, it is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in the prevalence and mortality of the disease is predicted for the coming decades. These increases are mainly linked to the epidemic of tobacco exposure and indoor and outdoor air pollution in Asian countries. The burden of COPD in Asia is currently greater than that in developed Western countries, both in terms of the total number of deaths and the burden of disease, as measured in years of life lost and years spent living with disability. The types of health-care policies and the practice of medicine vary considerably among the regions of Asia and have an impact on the burden of disease. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. To reduce this burden of COPD in Asian countries, there is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and in the wider use of evidence-based management for COPD.","publish_time":"2015-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Wan C.; Ng, Tze P.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["burden of COPD","burden of disease","disease burden","Asian countries","implementation of disease management guidelines","accurate diagnosis of COPD","evidence-based management guidelines","types of health","Western countries","championing health policies","World Health Organization","global health concern","mortality","increases","care policies","major cause of chronic morbidity","awareness of prevalence","medical practice","practice of medicine","regions of Asia","years of life","chronic respiratory diseases","wider use of evidence","leading cause of death","outdoor air pollution","lack of organizational support","issues of resource conflict","cultural differences","epidemic of tobacco exposure","terms","total number of deaths","main risk factors","multifaceted approach","need","impact","Barriers","coming decades","Treatment","disability"],"language":"en"},

In the past years, methods to systematically identify glycan and protein interactions have advanced. In particular sensitivity, speed and coverage of mass spectrometric analyses allow for high-throughput identification of glycans and peptides separated by liquid chromatography. Also, developments in glycan microarray technologies have led to targeted, high-throughput screening and identification of glycan-based receptors. The mapping of cell surface interactions of the diverse adenovirus types has implications for cell, tissue, and species tropism as well as drug development. Here we review known adenovirus interactions with glycan- and protein-based receptors, as well as glycomics and proteomics strategies to identify yet elusive virus receptors and attachment factors.

Most disease is caused by a small number of meningococcal genotypes known as hyperinvasive lineages. As these are also carried asymptomatically, acquisition of them alone cannot explain why only some hosts develop meningococcal disease. Our aim was to determine whether genetic diversity in CEACAM is associated with susceptibility to meningococcal disease. Frequency distributions of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were compared in four CEACAM genes in 384 case samples and 190 controls. Linkage disequilibrium among polymorphic sites, haplotype structures and relationships were also analysed. A number of polymorphisms were observed in CEACAM genes but the diversity of CEACAM1, to which most Opa proteins bind, was lower, and a small number of high-frequency haplotypes were detected. Dose-dependent associations of three CEACAM haplotypes with meningococcal disease were observed, with the effect of carrying these haplotypes amplified in homozygous individuals. Two haplotypes were protective while one haplotype in CEACAM6 was associated with a twofold increase in disease susceptibility. These data imply that human CEACAM may be one determinant of human susceptibility to meningococcal disease.","publish_time":"2007-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callaghan, M J; Rockett, K; Banner, C; Haralambous, E; Betts, H; Faust, S; Maiden, M C J; Kroll, J S; Levin, M; Kwiatkowski, D P; Pollard, A J","journal":"Genes Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6364ca0ffa46d82fceaf412b092e78935cb1268b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEACAM haplotypes","disease susceptibility","pathogenesis of meningococcal disease","human CEACAM","CEACAM genes","frequency haplotypes","small number of meningococcal genotypes","Opa proteins","determinant of human susceptibility","small number of high","number of polymorphisms","proteins of Neisseria meningitidis","opacity-associated adhesin","important stage","haplotype structures","diversity of CEACAM1","human carcino-embryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule","genetic diversity","important bacterial infection","Frequency distributions of alleles","polymorphic sites","Linkage disequilibrium","CEACAM6","relationships","case samples","twofold increase","Dose-dependent associations","hyperinvasive lineages","controls","aim","homozygous individuals","data","effect","hosts","acquisition"],"language":"en"},

Macrolide-based treatment was administered to 190 (25.9 %) patients. Patients who received macrolides had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease more often, lower severity on admission (APACHE II score on ICU admission (13.1 \u00B1 6.8 vs. 14.4 \u00B1 7.4 points, p \u003C 0.05), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome less often (23.4 vs. 30.1 %, p \u003C 0.05).

In this point-of-view review paper, a group of experts discuss the main controversies in SCAP: the role of severity scores to guide patient settings of care and empiric antibiotic therapy; the emergence of pathogens outside the core microorganisms of CAP; viral SCAP; the best empirical treatment; septic shock as the most lethal complication; and the need for new antibiotics. METHODS: For all topics, the authors describe current controversies and evidence and provide recommendations and suggestions for future research. Evidence was based on meta-analyses, most recent RCTs and recent interventional or observational studies. Recommendations were reached by consensus of all the authors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The IDSA/ATS criteria remain the most pragmatic tool to predict ICU admission. The authors recommend a combination of a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or a third G cephalosporin plus a macrolide in most SCAP patients, and to empirically cover PES (P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) pathogens when at least two specific risk factors are present.

Remarkable progress has been made in attenuating the inflammatory injury associated with ALI using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based cell and gene therapy. However, to date, the benefits of interleukin-35 (IL-35)-modified MSCs in ALI intervention have not been investigated. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6 mice randomly received intravenous infusion of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) constitutively expressing IL-35 (IL-35-GFP-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) via retrovirus-mediated transduction (8 \u00D7 10(5) cells per mice) or isotonic saline 7 days before ALI modeling to investigate the effect and related mechanism. ALI was performed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation for 24 h. Normal mice served as the sham group. The results indicated that compared with GFP-ADSCs, IL-35-modified ADSCs significantly increased cellular and pulmonary IL-10 and IL-35 production. Pretreatment with IL-35-ADSCs markedly reduced body weight loss, pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio and pathological injury. The PO(2) was rescued to normal levels in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs. IL-35-ADSCs infusion apparently inhibited IL-6 release, protein leakage and MPO activity but greatly elevated IL-35 level in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Splenic regulatory T cells in IL-35-ADSCs-pretreated mice got effective increase. Moreover, IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment remarkably inhibited neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and greatly decreased IL-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. In conclusion, pretreatment with IL-35-engineered ADSCs provided effective protection against LPS-induced ALI through suppression of pulmonary inflammation and, thus, might be a promising strategy to improve outcomes after ALI. The enhanced paracrine and immunosuppressive capacity of IL-35-ADSCs might contribute to their beneficial effects. However, further studies are needed to illuminate the detailed mechanism.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaoning; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Ju, Mingyan; Li, Jiaci; Jing, Yaqing; Zhao, Yuxia; Gu, Chao; Dong, Ming; Li, Guang; Liu, Yi","journal":"Inflammopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1073f53feca2aa342be6ff463aeef8ab26d4c62f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary IL","inhibited IL","elevated IL","GFP-ADSCs","ADSCs pretreatment","ADSCs infusion","modified ADSCs","engineered ADSCs","ADSCs-pretreated mice","immunosuppressive capacity of IL","ALI modeling","pulmonary injury","ALI intervention","Normal mice","LPS-induced ALI","pathological injury","inflammatory injury","derived mesenchymal stem cells","suppression of pulmonary inflammation","modified MSCs","Acute lung injury","Splenic regulatory T cells","TNF-\u03B1","effective protection","inhibited neutrophil","effective increase","supportive therapy","gene therapy","normal levels","related mechanism","detailed mechanism","dry weight ratio","intravenous infusion of adipose","reduced body weight loss","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","release","advances","MPO activity","protein leakage","isotonic saline","drug treatment","based cell","adult male C57BL","macrophage infiltration","high mortality","days","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","present study","receptor","Toll","inhalation","retrovirus-mediated transduction","TLR4","BALF","promising strategy","outcomes","benefits of interleukin","sham group","lipopolysaccharide","expression","date","beneficial effects","conclusion","Remarkable progress","studies","results","production"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza pneumonia admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain between June 2009 and April 2014. Patients who received corticosteroid treatment for causes other than viral pneumonia (e.g., refractory septic shock and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) were excluded. Patients with corticosteroid therapy were compared with those without corticosteroid therapy. We use a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to reduce confounding factors. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analysis was performed to assess the impact of corticosteroids on ICU mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1846 patients with primary influenza pneumonia were enrolled. Corticosteroids were administered in 604 (32.7%) patients, with methylprednisolone the most frequently used corticosteroid (578/604 [95.7%]). The median daily dose was equivalent to 80 mg of methylprednisolone (IQR 60\u2013120) for a median duration of 7 days (IQR 5\u201310). Asthma, COPD, hematological disease, and the need for mechanical ventilation were independently associated with corticosteroid use. Crude ICU mortality was higher in patients who received corticosteroids (27.5%) than in patients who did not receive corticosteroids (18.8%, p \u003C 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid use was associated with ICU mortality in the Cox (HR = 1.32 [95% CI 1.08\u20131.60], p \u003C 0.006) and competing risks analysis (SHR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.12\u20131.68], p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Administration of corticosteroids in patients with severe influenza pneumonia is associated with increased ICU mortality, and these agents should not be used as co-adjuvant therapy.

OBJECTIVES: A systematic description of a seasonal influenza patient population at a German university hospital to improve risk stratification and clinical care. METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective observational study of the 2017/2018 influenza season at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, patients with confirmed influenza infection were included. RESULTS: Of all influenza swabs performed in the emergency department, 24% (n = 162/676) were positive. A total of 255 patients (median age 66 years) had an influenza infection (influenza A n = 79, influenza B n = 176); 27 (15.3%) were nosocomial infections. Of the 179 (70.2%) patients that were hospitalized, 51 (20%) received intensive medical care. Patients with subsequent need for intensive care had an elevated CRP level (69.5 mg/dl [SD 62.8] vs. 141.7 [SD 127.2] mg/dl) at the time of influenza diagnosis and more frequent infiltrates in X\u2011ray/CT of the thorax (n = 43 [33.6%] vs. n = 43 [84.3%]). Antiviral therapy with oseltamivir was administered for 74 (29.0%) patients and 11 (6.1%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Of the 23 (9.0%) patients who died, only four of them had been vaccinated (trivalent). Those four had an influenza B infection. CONCLUSION: The structured use of diagnostic tests (influenza PCR, X\u2011ray/CT chest and CRP) and antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) as well as targeted management of admission, intensive care capacities, and an increase in vaccination rates are important for improving patient care and optimizing the use of resources during seasonal influenza epidemics.","publish_time":"2019-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraef, Christian; van der Meirschen, Marc; Wichmann, Dominic; Kutza, Meike; Restemeyer, Cordula; Addo, Marylyn M.; Lohse, Ansgar W.; Schmiedel, Stefan; Kluge, Stefan; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian","journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13a7372734b2d67bd2c8c3f49a706b678e0af4e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzgwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","influenza season","influenza PCR","influenza swabs","influenza B n","influenza B infection","seasonal influenza epidemics","confirmed influenza infection","time of influenza diagnosis","seasonal influenza patient population","patient care","intensive medical care","intensive care capacities","clinical care","ray","oseltamivir","Antiviral therapy","SD","inpatient management","structured use of diagnostic tests","CT chest","use of resources","structured reports","University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf","German university hospital","targeted management of admission","elevated CRP level","risk stratification","increase","frequent infiltrates","systematic description","vaccination rates","retrospective observational study","years","median age","subsequent need","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","emergency department","ECMO","CONCLUSION","total","thorax","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","nosocomial infections","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Once a condition thought to be dominated by increased vasoconstrictor tone and thrombosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension is now seen as a vasculopathy in which structural changes driven by excessive vascular cell growth and inflammation, with recruitment and infiltration of circulating cells, play a major role. Perturbations of a number of molecular mechanisms have been described, including pathways involving growth factors, cytokines, metabolic signaling, elastases, and proteases, that may underlie the pathogenesis of the disease. Elucidating their contribution to the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension could offer new drug targets. The role of progenitor cells in vascular repair is also under active investigation. The right ventricular response to increased pressure load is recognized as critical to survival and the molecular mechanisms involved are attracting increasing interest. The challenge now is to integrate this new knowledge and explore how it can be used to categorize patients by molecular phenotype and tailor treatment more effectively.","publish_time":"2011-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schermuly, Ralph T.; Ghofrani, Hossein A.; Wilkins, Martin R.; Grimminger, Friedrich","journal":"Nat Rev Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c93c14bdf311100a1815bcc290697a396ad8d69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozg3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension","molecular phenotype","number of molecular mechanisms","role of progenitor cells","vascular repair","excessive vascular cell growth","growth factors","major role","new knowledge","increased pressure load","increased vasoconstrictor tone","infiltration of circulating cells","new drug targets","recruitment","inflammation","thrombosis","structural changes","paradigm shift","cytokines","right ventricular response","patients","tailor treatment","pathways","survival","approach","proteases","elastases","past decade","active investigation","vasculopathy","Perturbations","contribution","pathogenesis","disease","understanding","challenge","condition"],"language":"en"},

Although several predisposing factors have been identified, such as prematurity, enteral feeding, and infection, its pathogenesis remains elusive. In the past 20 years, we have established several animal models of NEC in rats and found several endogenous mediators, especially platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a pivotal role in NEC. Injection of PAF induces intestinal necrosis, and PAF antagonists prevent the bowel injury induced by bacterial endotoxin, hypoxia, or challenge with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) plus endotoxin in adult rats. The same is true for lesions induced by hypoxia and enteral feeding in neonatal animals. Human patients with NEC show high levels of PAF and decreased plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase, the enzyme degrading PAF. The initial event in our experimental models of NEC is probably polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and adhesion to venules in the intestine, which initiates a local inflammatory reaction involving proinflammatory mediators including TNF, complement, prostaglandins, and leukotriene C4. Subsequent norepinephrine release and mesenteric vasoconstriction result in splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion. Bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) enter the intestinal tissue during local mucosal barrier breakdown, and endotoxin synergizes with PAF to amplify the inflammation. Reactive oxygen species produced by the activated leukocytes and by intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase may be the final pathway for tissue injury. Protective mechanisms include nitric oxide produced by the constitutive (mainly neuronal) nitric oxide synthase, and indigenous probiotics such as Bifidobacteria infantis. The former maintains intestinal perfusion and the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the latter keep virulent bacteria in check. The development of tissue injury depends on the balance between injurious and protective mechanisms.","publish_time":"2002-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsueh, Wei; Caplan, Michael S.; Qu, Xiao-Wu; Tan, Xiao-Di; De Plaen, Isabelle G.; Gonzalez-Crussi, F.","journal":"Pediatr Dev Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46b58b6559eee9fc0c34a0816ad65c084aa71e4d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Necrotizing"],"organizations":["NEC","PAF","TNF","Bifidobacteria"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PAF antagonists","Injection of PAF","intestinal tissue","high levels of PAF","intestinal necrosis","bacterial endotoxin","experimental models of NEC","animal models of NEC","decreased plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase","intestinal perfusion","development of tissue injury","hypoxia","TNF","bowel injury","enteral feeding","Protective mechanisms","intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase","local mucosal barrier breakdown","nitric oxide synthase","tumor necrosis factor","proinflammatory mediators","neonatal animals","endogenous mediators","adult rats","Bacterial products","local inflammatory reaction","neonatal intensive care units","mesenteric vasoconstriction result","mortality","activated leukocytes","indigenous probiotics","PMN","polymorphonuclear leukocyte","challenge","leading cause of morbidity","splanchnic ischemia","final pathway","Subsequent norepinephrine release","adhesion","activation","infection","balance","premature infants","venules","reperfusion","intestine","prostaglandins","disease","Human patients","lesions","integrity","platelet","enzyme","Reactive oxygen species","initial event","Bifidobacteria infantis","pathogenesis","prematurity","virulent bacteria","Necrotizing enterocolitis","check","years","leukotriene C4","pivotal role","predisposing factors","inflammation"],"language":"en"},

Published information suggests that flies (Diptera) may play a role in spreading this virus; however, they have not been studied extensively and the degree of their involvement is not known. This investigation was directed toward evaluating the vector capacity of such flies and determining their potential role in the transmission and ecology of CPV. Molecular diagnostic methods were used in this cross-sectional study to detect the presence of CPV in flies trapped at thirty-eight canine facilities. The flies involved were identified as belonging to the house fly (Mucidae), flesh fly (Sarcophagidae) and blow/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) families. A primary surveillance location (PSL) was established at a canine facility in south-central South Carolina, USA, to identify fly\u2013virus interaction within the canine facility environment. Flies trapped at this location were pooled monthly and assayed for CPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. These insects were found to be positive for CPV every month from February through the end of November 2011. Fly vector behavior and seasonality were documented and potential environmental risk factors were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the mean numbers of each of the three fly families captured, and after determining fly CPV status (positive or negative), it was determined whether there were significant relationships between numbers of flies captured, seasonal numbers of CPV cases, temperature and rainfall. Flies were also sampled at thirty-seven additional canine facility surveillance locations (ASL) and at four non-canine animal industry locations serving as negative field controls. Canine facility risk factors were identified and evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on the number of CPV cases reported within the past year to determine the correlation of fly CPV status (positive or negative) for each facility, facility design (open or closed), mean number of dogs present monthly and number of flies captured. Significant differences occurred between fly CPV positive vs. negative sites with regard to their CPV case numbers, fly numbers captured, and number of dogs present. At the ASL, a statistically significant relationship was found between PCR-determined fly CPV status (positive or negative) and facility design (open vs. closed). Open-facility designs were likely to have more CPV outbreaks and more likely to have flies testing positive for CPV DNA.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bagshaw, Clarence; Isdell, Allen E.; Thiruvaiyaru, Dharma S.; Brisbin, I.

Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, has caused 182 cases to date, with ~43% mortality, and no small animal model has been reported. MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (\u03B2-CoV) subgroup 2c share \u003E65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are significant drug and vaccine targets. BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c \u03B2-CoVs. We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE). This virus replicates efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge. Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice. Passaged virus was characterized by mutations in the nsp13, nsp14, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) and M genes. Finally, we identified an inhibitor active against the nsp5 proteases of subgroup 2c \u03B2-CoVs. Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad-based therapeutics, evaluating vaccine outcomes, and studying viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Yount, Boyd L.; Donaldson, Eric F.; Huynh, Jeremy; Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Graham, Rachel L.; Becker, Michelle M.; Tomar, Sakshi; Scobey, Trevor D.; Osswald, Heather L.; Whitmore, Alan; Gopal, Robin; Ghosh, Arun K.; Mesecar, Andrew; Zambon, Maria; Heise, Mark; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e2c97d34c8c6042f26cc11e83e1a2fbac521203.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3977350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667706/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00047-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["testing of BtCoV HKU5","BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge","Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE","CoV spike","MERS-CoV N","b SARS-CoV vaccines","strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus","c \u03B2-CoVs","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","aged mice","young mice","vaccine targets","Passaged virus","nsp5 proteases of subgroup","virus targets airway","vaccine outcomes","vaccine studies","c share","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle","severe acute respiratory syndrome","extensive eosinophilia","viral pathogenesis","strong eosinophilia","significant drug","synthetic reconstruction","nonstructural protein","cell culture","Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens","diffuse alveolar damage","alveolar epithelial cells","Cross-species transmission of zoonotic coronaviruses","phylogenetic relatives","VRP","glycoprotein ectodomain","hyaline membrane formation","Pipistrellus bat coronavirus","new strategies","weight loss","broad-based therapeutics","open reading frame","nsp13","nsp14","regions","identity","enhanced virulence","amino acid level","mortality","ORF5","mutations","inhibitor active","small animal model","nucleocapsid","pandemic disease outbreaks","date","silico","cases"],"language":"en"},

This review examines the scientific data related to the effects of pre- and probiotics on the treatment of diseases occurring in the skin, female urogenital tract, and respiratory tract. The evidence suggests that probiotics consumption can decrease the presence of eczema in children when their mothers have consumed probiotics during pregnancy and lactation. In women, probiotics consumption can effectively prevent recurrent urinary tract infections. The consumption of synbiotic products can reduce respiratory tract infections and their duration and severity. However, the outcomes of the meta-analyses are still limited and not sufficiently conclusive to support the use of probiotics to treat infectious diseases.

Treatment of cells with IFN activates genes encoding several double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent synthetases. These enzymes generate 5\u2032-triphosphorylated, 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiester-linked oligoadenylates (2\u20135A) from ATP. The effects of 2\u20135A in cells are transient since 2\u20135A is unstable in cells due to the activities of phosphodiesterase and phosphatase. 2\u20135A activates the endoribonuclease 2\u20135A-dependent RNase L, causing degradation of single-stranded RNA with moderate specificity. The human 2\u20135A-dependent RNase is an 83.5 kDa polypeptide that has little, if any, RNase activity, unless 2\u20135A is present. 2\u20135A binding to RNase L switches the enzyme from its off-state to its on-state. At least three 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates and a single 5\u2032-phosphoryl group are required for maximal activation of the RNase. Even though the constitutive presence of 2\u20135A-dependent RNase is observed in nearly all mammalian cell types, cellular amounts of 2\u20135A-dependent mRNA and activity can increase after IFN treatment. One well-established role of the 2\u20135A system is as a host defense against some types of viruses. Since virus infection of cells results in the production and secretion of IFNs, and since dsRNA is both a frequent product of virus infection and an activator of 2\u20135A synthesis, the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, which produces dsRNA during its life cycle, is greatly suppressed in IFN-treated cells as a direct result of RNA decay by the activated 2\u20135A-clependent RNase. This review covers the organic chemistry, enzymology, and molecular biology of 2\u20135A and its associated enzymes. Additional possible biological roles of the 2\u20135A system, such as in cell growth and differentiation, human immunodeficiency virus replication, heat shock, atherosclerotic plaque, pathogenesis of Type I diabetes, and apoptosis, are presented.","publish_time":"1998-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Player, Mark R.; Torrence, Paul F.","journal":"Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e8c44c27b0b817004e6097bd264e21de2b766c1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725897001678; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725897001678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dependent RNase","RNase activity","clependent RNase","virus infection of cells","Treatment of cells","dsRNA","IFN-treated cells","dependent mRNA","dependent synthetases","system","IFN treatment","double-stranded RNA","replication of encephalomyocarditis virus","RNA degradation pathway","human immunodeficiency virus replication","degradation of single","frequent product of virus infection","state","direct result of RNA decay","mammalian cell types","phosphodiester-linked oligoadenylates","cell growth","types of viruses","secretion of IFNs","associated enzymes","heat shock","atherosclerotic plaque","differentiation","pathogenesis of Type","enzymology","organic chemistry","diabetes","phosphoryl group","cellular amounts","maximal activation","host defense","activator","synthesis","moderate specificity","production","molecular biology","activities of phosphodiesterase","Additional possible biological roles","review","binding","switches","kDa polypeptide","life cycle","phosphatase","apoptosis","well-established role","constitutive presence","interferons","endoribonuclease","ATP","effects"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of the literature shows that there are a number of unanswered questions concerning the management of CAP, including its definition, the absence of a paediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying its aetiology, the emergence of resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents, and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of vaccines against respiratory pathogens.

Particles enter respirators through two principle penetration pathways: faceseal leakage and filter penetration. However, it is unknown how breathing frequency affects the overall performance of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs) against viral particles, as well as other health-relevant submicrometer particles. METHODS: A FFR and SM were tested on a breathing manikin at four mean inspiratory flows (MIFs) (15, 30, 55 and 85 L/min) and five breathing frequencies (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 breaths/min). Filter penetration (P(filter)) and total inward leakage (TIL) were determined for the tested respiratory protection devices against sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol particles in the size range of 20 to 500 nm. \u201CFaceseal leakage-to-filter\u201D (FLTF) penetration ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Both MIF and breathing frequency showed significant effects (p\u003C0.05) on P(filter) and TIL. Increasing breathing frequency increased TIL for the N95 FFR whereas no clear trends were observed for the SM. Increasing MIF increased P(filter) and decreased TIL resulting in decreasing FLTF ratio. Most of FLTF ratios were \u003E1, suggesting that the faceseal leakage was the primary particle penetration pathway at various breathing frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing frequency is another factor (besides MIF) that can significantly affect the performance of N95 FFRs, with higher breathing frequencies increasing TIL. No consistent trend of increase or decrease of TIL with either MIF or breathing frequency was observed for the tested SM. To potentially extend these findings beyond the manikin/breathing system used, future studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism causing the breathing frequency effect on the performance of respiratory protection devices on human subjects.","publish_time":"2014-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Xinjian; Reponen, Tiina; McKay, Roy; Grinshpun, Sergey A.","journal":"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6137baa6da1c34a8cf59be36b52928a1930ef1f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6768065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521067/; https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2013.848037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SM","FLTF","MIF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["breathing manikin","breathing frequency increased TIL","breathing frequency effect","filter penetration","various breathing frequencies","higher breathing frequencies","faceseal leakage","penetration ratios","Increasing MIF increased P","performance of N95 FFRs","aerosol particles","viral particles","FLTF ratios","principle penetration pathways","performance of respiratory protection devices","tested respiratory protection devices","primary particle penetration pathway","total inward leakage","breaths","overall performance of N95 filtering facepiece respirators","health-relevant submicrometer particles","decreasing FLTF ratio","sodium chloride","NaCl","surgical masks","SMs","mean inspiratory flows","size range","human subjects","individuals","system","significant effects","factor","clear trends","levels of physical activity","MIFs","findings","CONCLUSIONS","mechanism","BACKGROUND","consistent trend of increase","future studies","nm","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Beak trimming is a common practice to control these problems, but in Finland beak trimming is prohibited. Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. This experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. The online questionnaire aimed to gather information about Finnish farmers\u2019 attitudes towards beak trimming, their estimation of the seriousness of pecking problems in their laying hen flocks, common risk factors and the best practices to prevent attendant problems. The questionnaire received 35 responses. Finnish egg producers appeared strongly to support a policy of not trimming beaks. Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be unnecessary and unethical. Most respondents did not regard pecking-related problems as being very severe in their flocks. Lighting, feeding and flock management problems represented the most important risk factors regarding pecking problems. Generally, the same topics were highlighted as being the most important intervention measures for managing an on-going pecking problem. The study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as a component of sustainable egg production. ABSTRACT: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, compromising hen welfare, causing farmers economic losses and negatively affecting sustainability. These problems are often controlled by beak trimming, which in Finland is prohibited. An online questionnaire aimed to collect information from farmers about pecking-related problems in Finnish laying hen flocks, important risk factors and the best experiences to prevent the problems. Additionally, the farmers\u2019 attitudes towards beak trimming were examined. We received 35 responses, which represents about 13% of all Finnish laying hen farms with \u2265300 laying hens. The majority of respondents stated that a maximum of 5\u20137% incidence of feather pecking or 1\u20132% incidence of cannibalism would be tolerable. The majority of respondents (74%) expressed that they would definitely not use beak-trimmed hens. Only two respondents indicated that they would probably use beak-trimmed hens were the practice permitted. Among risk factors, light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Other important problems included those that occurred during rearing, feeding, flock management and problems with drinking water equipment (mean 5.9, each). The most important intervention measures included optimal lighting and feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. Concluding, Finnish farmers had strong negative attitudes towards beak trimming. The study underlines the importance of flock management, especially lighting and feeding, in preventing pecking problems and indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy into sustainable egg production.","publish_time":"2019-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaukonen, Eija; Valros, Anna","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dbe0bb2d5bfc8c90c1a0185c6ea608452b08276.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6406704.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704113/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9020043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["important problems","Pecking-related problems","seriousness of pecking problems","flock management problems","attendant problems","Finland beak trimming","management of pecking","non-beak","beak-trimmed hens","Finnish egg producers","intensive egg production","important risk factors","Finnish laying hen flocks","common risk factors","Finnish laying hen farms","component of sustainable egg production","laying hens","on-going pecking problem","Finnish farmers\u2019 attitudes","important intervention measures","production performance","decades-long experience of egg production","importance of flock management","common practice","policy","majority of respondents","diminishing hen welfare","online questionnaire","information","optimal lighting","intact-beaked hens","sustainability","study","responses","strong negative attitudes","farmers economic losses","best practices","best experiences","highest mean","incidence of cannibalism","incidence of feather","estimation","light intensity","drinking water equipment","SIMPLE SUMMARY","maximum","pecker","rearing","ABSTRACT","Motivation","victim","countries","beaks","scale","topics"],"language":"en"},

Bats are linked to a growing number of EID but few studies have explored the factors of viral richness in bats. These may have implications for role of bats as potential reservoirs. We investigated the determinants of viral richness in 15 species of African bats (8 Pteropodidae and 7 microchiroptera) in Central and West Africa for which we provide new information on virus infection and bat phylogeny. We performed the first comparative analysis testing the correlation of the fragmented geographical distribution (defined as the perimeter to area ratio) with viral richness in bats. Because of their potential effect, sampling effort, host body weight, ecological and behavioural traits such as roosting behaviour, migration and geographical range, were included into the analysis as variables. The results showed that the geographical distribution size, shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats. Viral richness was higher in large-bodied bats which had larger and more fragmented distribution areas. Accumulation of viruses may be related to the historical expansion and contraction of bat species distribution range, with potentially strong effects of distribution edges on virus transmission. Two potential explanations may explain these results. A positive distribution edge effect on the abundance or distribution of some bat species could have facilitated host switches. Alternatively, parasitism could play a direct role in shaping the distribution range of hosts through host local extinction by virulent parasites. This study highlights the importance of considering the fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution in order to understand their role in the circulation of viruses in Africa.","publish_time":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maganga, Ga\u00EBl D.; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Vallo, Peter; Dallo, Thierno D.; Ngoagouni, Carine; Drexler, Jan Felix; Drosten, Christian; Nakoun\u00E9, Emmanuel R.; Leroy, Eric M.; Morand, Serge","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eefe017d2a4fedeac3243fb76f3b417b16023f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4069033.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24959855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":["Africa","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["fragmented geographical distribution","role of bats","geographical distribution size","fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution","distribution range of hosts","contraction of bat species distribution range","fragmented distribution areas","species of African bats","factors of viral richness","determinants of viral richness","geographical range","strong effects of distribution edges","positive distribution edge effect","large-bodied bats","host body weight","host switches","bat phylogeny","potential effect","host local extinction","direct role","habitat fragmentation","potential reservoirs","potential explanations","results","significant effects","virus infection","virus transmission","West Africa","circulation of viruses","comparative analysis","Accumulation of viruses","growing number of EID","behavioural traits","shape","abundance","roosting behaviour","sampling effort","new information","studies","microchiroptera","migration","Pteropodidae","rising incidence of emerging infectious diseases","historical expansion","correlation","perimeter","order","virulent parasites","area ratio","changes","biodiversity loss","importance","implications","parasitism","study","variables"],"language":"en"},

In these countries, due to unfavorable meteorological conditions, such as elevated ambient temperature, high relative humidity, and natural events such as dust storms, people spend a substantial amount of their time in indoor environments. In addition, production of physical and biological aerosols from air conditioners, cooking activities, burning of Arabian incense, and overcrowding due to pilgrimage programs are common causes of low quality indoor air in this region. Thus, due to infiltration of outdoor sources as well as various indoor sources, people living in the GCC countries are highly exposed to indoor air pollutants. Inhalation of indoor air pollutants causes mortalities and morbidities attributed to cardiorespiratory, pulmonary, and lung cancer diseases. Hence, the aim of this review study is to provide a summary of the major findings of indoor air pollution studies in different microenvironments in six GCC countries. These include characterization of detected indoor air pollutants, exposure concentration levels, source identifications, sustainable building designs and ventilation systems, and the mitigation strategies. To do so, \u003E130 relevant indoor air pollution studies across the GCC countries were critically reviewed. Particulate matters (PM(10) and PM(2.5)), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and heavy metals were identified as the reported indoor air pollutants. Apart from them, indoor Radon and bioaerosols were studied only in specific GCC countries. Thus, future studies should also focus on the investigation of emerging indoor air pollutants, such as ultrafine and nanoparticles and their associated health effects. Furthermore, studies on the mitigation of indoor air pollution through the development of advanced air purification and ventilation systems could improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) in the GCC region.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amoatey, Patrick; Omidvarborna, Hamid; Baawain, Mahad Said; Al-Mamun, Abdullah","journal":"Environ Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da9ae9cfb0eca6c0a6ae9e71dc59a08baecffdbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132391.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018318142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30286426/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412018318142; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.09.043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GCC","Gulf Cooperation Council"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indoor air quality","reported indoor air pollutants","mitigation of indoor air pollution","Inhalation of indoor air pollutants","indoor environments","indoor Radon","relevant indoor air pollution studies","air conditioners","characterization of detected indoor air pollutants","investigation of emerging indoor air pollutants","major findings of indoor air pollution studies","various indoor sources","common causes of low quality indoor air","specific GCC countries","development of advanced air purification","GCC region","future studies","ventilation systems","people","carbon dioxide","sulfur dioxide","nitrogen dioxide","mitigation strategies","associated health effects","infiltration of outdoor sources","human health threat problems","exposure concentration levels","source identifications","elevated ambient temperature","high relative humidity","sustainable building designs","Gulf Cooperation Council","natural events","different microenvironments","TVOCs","biological aerosols","morbidities","mortalities","total volatile organic compounds","dust storms","production of physical","pilgrimage programs","unfavorable meteorological conditions","activities","summary","nanoparticles","IAQ","bioaerosols","lung cancer diseases","review study","addition","time","Arabian incense","heavy metals","aim","Particulate matters"],"language":"en"},

Whether some factors affect virus replication and proliferation had not been fully understood in the course of nerve damage caused by PHEV infection. In recent years, some reports suggested that miRNA might play a key regulatory role in viral infection. In this study, we found the miR-21a-5p is notably up-regulated in the brains of mice and N2a cells infected with PHEV, and it down-regulated the expression of CASK-interactive protein1 (Caskin1) by directly targeting the 3\u2032-UTR of Caskin1 using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The over-expression of miR-21a-5p or Caskin1 knockdown in the host significantly contributes to PHEV proliferation. Conversely, the silencing of miR-21a-5p by miR-21a-5p inhibitors suppressed the virus proliferation. Taken together, our results indicate that Caskin1 is the direct target gene of miR-21a-5p, and it is advantageous to virus proliferation by down-regulating Caskin1. These findings may help in the development of strategies for therapeutic applications.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Xiaoling; Zhao, Kui; Lan, Yungang; Li, Zi; Ding, Ning; Su, Jingjing; Lu, Huijun; Song, Deguang; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14723bfc42908c3f8f522692be41062a7cda62d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5331037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298907/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00304","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHEV proliferation","virus proliferation","PHEV infection","Caskin1 knockdown","UTR of Caskin1","p inhibitors","silencing of miR","over-expression of miR","virus replication","direct target gene of miR","Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","viral infection","expression of CASK","muscle tremors","nervous symptoms","piglets","hind limb paralysis","miRNA","key regulatory role","host","Dual-Luciferase reporter assay","N2a cells","neurovirulent coronavirus","interactive protein1","course of nerve damage","development of strategies","brains of mice","therapeutic applications","reports","nystagmus","factors","recent years","results","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

The substitution of His220 with threonine completely abolished its translocation. The VP1 proteins of other CVB types might have the nuclear localization potential because this region was highly conserved.

Both kits specifically detected all rabies virus strains and there was no cross reactivity with Lyssaviruses (Lagos, Mokola and Duvenhage), Rhabdovirus (VSV and Oita 296/1972) and other common canine\u2010pathogenic viruses.

However, neither drug could completely inhibit replication of SARS-CoV even at concentrations up to 100\u03BCg/ml.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saijo, Masayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Hasegawa, Hideki; Nagata, Noriyo; Iwata, Naoko; Kurane, Ichiro","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d5ab19bef25b700b2d283b8c57f8f044fb24290.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114120.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354205000276; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354205000276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCg","SARS-CoV Frankfurt","SARS-CoV HKU39849","Mizoribine inhibited replication of SARS","infectious SARS-CoV titers","IC50 of ribavirin","cytotoxic concentration of mizoribine","plaque reduction","yield reduction assays","inhibitory concentration","severe acute respiratory syndrome","associated coronavirus","Vero E6 cells","IMPDH","inhibitors","monophosphate dehydrogenase","concentrations","activity of inosine","drug"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the continued search for new antiretroviral agents with unique and different mechanisms of HIV inhibition remains critical, and compounds that can reduce the level of virus production from cells already infected with HIV, as opposed to preventing de novo infection, would be of great benefit. A mercaptobenzamide (MDH-1-38) and its prodrug (NS1040) are being developed as potential therapeutic compounds targeting the zinc finger of HIV nucleocapsid. In the presence of esterase enzymes, NS1040 is designed to be converted to MDH-1-38 which has antiviral activity. While we presume that NS1040 is rapidly converted to MDH-1-38 in all experiments, the two compounds were tested side-by-side to determine whether the presence of a prodrug affects the antiviral activity or mechanism of action. The two compounds were evaluated against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates in human PBMCs and monocyte-macrophages and yielded EC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 13 \u03BCM with no toxicity up to 100 \u03BCM. MDH-1-38 and NS1040 remained equally active in human PBMCs in the presence of added serum proteins as well as against HIV-1 isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease inhibitors. Cell-based and biochemical mechanism of antiviral action assays demonstrated MDH-1-38 and NS1040 were virucidal at concentrations of 15 and 50 \u03BCM, respectively. Cell to cell transmission of HIV in multiple passages was significantly reduced in CEM-SS and human PBMCs by reducing progeny virus infectivity at compound concentrations greater than 2 \u03BCM. The combination of either MDH-1-38 or NS1040 with other FDA-approved HIV drugs yielded additive to synergistic antiviral interactions with no evidence of antiviral antagonism or synergistic toxicity. Serial dose escalation was used in attempts to select for HIV strains resistant to MDH-1-38 and NS1040. Virus at several passages failed to replicate in cells treated at increased compound concentrations, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of the virus inactivating compounds. Through 14 passages, resistance to the compounds has not been achieved. Most HIV inhibitors with mechanism of antiviral action targeting a viral protein would have selected for a drug resistant virus within 14 passages. These studies indicate that these NCp7-targeted compounds represent new potent anti-HIV drug candidates which could be effectively used in combination with all approved anti-HIV drugs.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hartman, T.

A particular issue is the detection of genetically diverse pathogens, i.e. human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV) which are frequent causes of FRI. Resequencing Pathogen Microarray technology has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking. RESULTS: Using HRV and HEV as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and serotyping genetically diverse viruses. A minimal number of probe sequences (26 for HRV and 13 for HEV), which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of HRV and HEV, were determined and implemented on the Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu v.30/31 (Tessarae RPM-Flu). The specificities of designed probes were validated using 34 HRV and 28 HEV strains. All strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level. 33 HRV strains and 16 HEV strains could be further differentiated to serotype level. CONCLUSION: This study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and differential identification of genetically diverse RNA viruses with a minimal number of prototype sequences. The results demonstrated that the newly designed RPM-Flu v.30/31 can provide comprehensive and specific analysis of HRV and HEV samples which implicates that this design strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zheng; Malanoski, Anthony P; Lin, Baochuan; Kidd, Carolyn; Long, Nina C; Blaney, Kate M; Thach, Dzung C; Tibbetts, Clark; Stenger, David A","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9693080ead2c95fe79e8bf077637b5585cac664f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2607299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19046445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV strains","HEV strains","diverse viruses","serotypes of HRV","HEV samples","diverse pathogens","diverse RNA viruses","specific analysis of HRV","designed RPM-Flu","differential diagnosis","Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu","Tessarae RPM-Flu","differential identification","respiratory pathogens","general design strategy","RESULTS","Resequencing Pathogen Microarray technology","high confidence design method","minimal number of prototype sequences","minimal number of probe sequences","specificities of designed probes","high impact","species level","Febrile respiratory illness","fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection","potential","global economics","frequent causes","public health","difficult challenge","enteroviruses","human rhinoviruses","test cases","study","BACKGROUND","particular issue","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, what is much less clear is the impact of COVID-19 on medical education. Already, faculty and medical students are grappling with the changes that have been made and attempting to consolidate these with their plan of career development. Changes that may seem relatively minor in comparison to the global pandemic have the potential to be drastic turning points in the career progression of many. As not much is known regarding the long-lasting impact of COVID-19 on medical education, it is therefore also necessary to record and study the full impact of the changes being made. The path to entering a successful residency has been predictable for the last few years - do well on Step 1, give conference presentations, go the extra mile in clerkships and shadowing opportunities, and have meaningful non-academic extracurricular activities - all of which designed to best demonstrate a student\u0027s knowledge, persistence, collaborative spirit, and dedication to medicine. This trajectory has been changed with COVID-19 disrupting routines in hospitals, medical schools and beyond. The replacement of in-person classes with online equivalents is an obvious necessity at this time but creates a loss of collaborative experiences that has the potential to be a significant detriment to education. Likewise, the cancellation of clerkships, which are necessary for both skill acquisition as well as for relationship building, is a serious issue which students and medical schools must now resolve. Many medical students have also lost the opportunity for personal development through conference presentations. These presentations play a large role in distinguishing applicants during the residency application process, and therefore these lost opportunities have the potential to be a serious detriment to medical students\u2019 career trajectory. While implementing technology to help resolve these issues is a unique way to help students to develop these skills, it is now necessary for medical students to demonstrate the same set of skills which they would have previously in a completely new and innovative manner. Persistence and adaptability during this time of challenge are attributes that medical students can demonstrate more readily. While every student has a personal story of how COVID-19 has impacted their education, there is no question that the impacts of COVID-19 will be felt on an extensive level. The panic in the community is palpable, and many are confused by how to proceed in the wake of COVID-19. This is no different for medical students and faculty and the questions that arise regarding medical education and their future careers.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferrel, Meganne N; Ryan, John J","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/360d84d4f4680d9aa43b035cf27b1c8709a12fa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193226.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical education","medical schools","wake of COVID","medical students\u2019 career trajectory","impacts of COVID","long-lasting impact of COVID","potential","changes","conference presentations","serious detriment","career progression","persistence","lost opportunities","personal development","plan of career development","faculty","collaborative spirit","shadowing opportunities","serious issue","time of challenge","obvious necessity","global pandemic","significant detriment","successful residency","personal story","cancellation of clerkships","set of skills","residency application process","loss of collaborative experiences","distinguishing applicants","extra mile","opportunity","drastic turning points","online equivalents","disrupting routines","hospitals","person classes","questions","large role","widespread health consequences","meaningful non-academic extracurricular activities","pathology","relationship","dedication","student\u0027s knowledge","attributes","novel coronavirus","issues","comparison","medicine","skill acquisition","adaptability","unique way","Step","future careers","innovative manner","panic","community","years","replacement","extensive level","technology"],"language":"en"},

In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.g. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host. We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa. In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of emerging infectious diseases which has been proven invaluable in containing these viral infections and reducing burden of disease in humans and animals. Genomic surveillance of pathogenic agents will serve as a key epidemiological and research tool in the modern era of precision infectious diseases and in the future studies of virosphere.","publish_time":"2017-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Weifeng; Li, Juan; Zhou, Hong; Gao, George F.","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bef8702c9771266cbcebb9b0e9fd72537027d949.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-017-9211-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270793/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Middle East","Western Africa"],"keyphrases":["emerging viral pathogens","China","viral infections","Genomic surveillance of pathogenic agents","novel pathogenic agents","numerous novel zoonotic viral agents","coronavirus","field of emerging infectious diseases","application of genomic sequencing","humans","standard research tool","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","H7N9 virus","Zika virus","modern era of precision infectious diseases","MERS","recent Ebola epidemics","pandemic potential","natural reservoirs","years","evolution","outbreaks","burden of disease","SARS","transmission events","adaption","Western Africa","high morbidity","travelers","avian-origin influenza","future studies of virosphere","human host","mortality","animals","ZIKV","pathogen genomics","summary","addition"],"language":"en"},

One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 \u00D7 10(9)/L vs. 0.76 \u00D7 10(9)/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duan, Kai; Liu, Bende; Li, Cesheng; Zhang, Huajun; Yu, Ting; Qu, Jieming; Zhou, Min; Chen, Li; Meng, Shengli; Hu, Yong; Peng, Cheng; Yuan, Mingchao; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Zejun; Yu, Jianhong; Gao, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Dan; Yu, Xiaoqi; Li, Li; Zhang, Jiayou; Wu, Xiao; Li, Bei; Xu, Yanping; Chen, Wei; Peng, Yan; Hu, Yeqin; Lin, Lianzhen; Liu, Xuefei; Huang, Shihe; Zhou, Zhijun; Zhang, Lianghao; Wang, Yue; Zhang, Zhi; Deng, Kun; Xia, Zhiwu; Gong, Qin; Zhang, Wei; Zheng, Xiaobei; Liu, Ying; Yang, Huichuan; Zhou, Dongbo; Yu, Ding; Hou, Jifeng; Shi, Zhengli; Chen, Saijuan; Chen, Zhu; Zhang, Xinxin; Yang, Xiaoming","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7efba712ab58b22c1b8a7a4d545e8cc8c5572fc7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196837.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004168117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CP","d.

It is still not known if this distinction apply for twin gestations as well. Methods Retrospective study of women with DCDA twin gestations and HDP (2001\u20132015), with a placental pathology evaluation. Placental lesions were classified according to the Amsterdam criteria. Pregnancies with early onset HDP (\u226434 weeks) were compared with pregnancies with late onset HDP (\u003E34 weeks). Results Out of 1655 twin deliveries, 161 (9.7%) were complicated by HDP: 77 (47.8%) had preeclampsia, and 84 (52.2%) had gestational hypertension. Forty patients (24.8%) had early onset HDP. Early HDP was associated with a higher rate of 1 MVMs (p=0.01), \u22652 MVMs (p=0.009) and with a lower rate of chronic villitis (p=0.02). In multivariable analysis, using late HDP as reference, early HDP was associated with a higher prevalence of \u22651 MVMs (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.5, p=0.03) and \u22652 MVMs (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.05\u20136.3, p=0.04). Early HDP was also less associated with chronic villitis (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.9), as chronic villitis is usually associated with a more advanced gestational age.

We aimed to systematically document the seasonality of several human infectious disease pathogens in England and Wales, highlighting those organisms that appear weather-sensitive and therefore may be influenced by climate change in the future. METHODS: Data on infections in England and Wales from 1989 to 2014 were extracted from the Public Health England (PHE) SGSS surveillance database. We conducted a weekly, monthly and quarterly time series analysis of 277 pathogen serotypes. Each organism\u2019s time series was forecasted using the TBATS package in R, with seasonality detected using model fit statistics. Meteorological data hosted on the MEDMI Platform were extracted at a monthly resolution for 2001\u20132011. The organisms were then clustered by K-means into two groups based on cross correlation coefficients with the weather variables. RESULTS: Examination of 12.9 million infection episodes found seasonal components in 91/277 (33%) organism serotypes. Salmonella showed seasonal and non-seasonal serotypes. These results were visualised in an online Rshiny application. Seasonal organisms were then clustered into two groups based on their correlations with weather. Group 1 had positive correlations with temperature (max, mean and min), sunshine and vapour pressure and inverse correlations with mean wind speed, relative humidity, ground frost and air frost. Group 2 had the opposite but also slight positive correlations with rainfall (mm, \u003E 1 mm, \u003E 10 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of seasonality in pathogen time series data and the identification of relevant weather predictors can improve forecasting and public health planning.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 1, 2007, to February 28, 2010, among a surveillance population of 21,420 persons \u003E5 years old in rural western Kenya, we collected blood for culture and malaria smears, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for quantitative real-time PCR for ten viruses and three atypical bacteria, and urine for pneumococcal antigen testing on outpatients and inpatients meeting a ARI case definition (cough or difficulty breathing or chest pain and temperature \u003E38.0\u00B0C or oxygen saturation \u003C90% or hospitalization). We also collected swabs from asymptomatic controls, from which we calculated pathogen-attributable fractions, adjusting for age, season, and HIV-status, in logistic regression. We calculated incidence by pathogen, adjusting for health-seeking for ARI and pathogen-attributable fractions. Among 3,406 ARI patients \u003E5 years old (adjusted annual incidence 12.0 per 100 person-years), influenza A virus was the most common virus (22% overall; 11% inpatients, 27% outpatients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (16% overall; 23% inpatients, 14% outpatients), yielding annual incidences of 2.6 and 1.7 episodes per 100 person-years, respectively. Influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus were more prevalent in swabs among cases (22%, 6%, 8% and 5%, respectively) than controls. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parechovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not more prevalent among cases than controls. Pneumococcus and non-typhi Salmonella were more prevalent among HIV-infected adults, but prevalence of viruses was similar among HIV-infected and HIV-negative individuals. ARI incidence was highest during peak malaria season. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNFICANCE: Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus (by potential herd immunity from childhood vaccination or of HIV-infected adults) might prevent much of the substantial ARI incidence among persons \u003E5 years old in similar rural African settings.","publish_time":"2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feikin, Daniel R.; Njenga, M.

Primers P2 specific for CDV wild-type strains, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4 in the second round of nested PCR. Primers P3, P5 specific for CDV wild-type strain or vaccine strain, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4\u002BP6 in the second round of nested PCR. A fragment of 177 bp was amplified from vaccine strain genomic RNA, and a fragment of 247 bp from wild-type strain genomic RNA in the RT-nPCR, and two fragments of 247 bp and 177 bp were amplified from the mixed samples of vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for uninfected cells, or cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), rabies virus (RV), or canine adenovirus (CAV). The RT-nPCR method was used to detect 30 field samples suspected of canine distemper from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, and 51 samples in Shandong province. As a result of 30 samples, were found to be wild-type-like, and 5 to be vaccine-strain-like. The RT-nPCR method can be used to effectively detect and differentiate wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs vaccinated with CDV vaccine, and thus can be used in clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance.","publish_time":"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Si, Wei; Zhou, Shun; Wang, Zhao; Cui, Shang-jin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a05548f8c34051d47f568ce2135978de0f9515d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2880969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20433759/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-86","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV","Newcastle"],"locations":["Shandong"],"keyphrases":["CDV vaccine","CDV wild-type strains","vaccine-strain","wild-type CDV-infected dogs","wild-type strain genomic RNA","CDV genome","differentiation of wild","bp","vaccine strains of canine distemper virus","mixed samples of vaccine","round of nested PCR","RT-nPCR method","common reverse primer P4","forward primer","round PCR","common primer pair","canine coronavirus","canine parvovirus","canine adenovirus","field samples","pair of primers","Primers P2 specific","P5 specific","rabies virus","Primers P3","multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction","Newcastle disease virus","uninfected cells","clinical detection","CCV","NDV","CPV","P6","Jilin Provinces","Heilongjiang","P1","conserved region","fragments","epidemiological surveillance","Shandong province","amplification","CAV","result"],"language":"en"},

If a particular risk affects all individuals regardless of their age so that their hazard rate is age-independent, VSL is rather constant for people at different age; if hazard rate varies with age, VSL estimates are sensitive to age.

Results: 1 777 participants were included: 77% women and 72 % aged 25-54 years. Quarantine conditions were most frequently in couples with children (36 %) and in a house with a garden (51 %). 47 % of participants reported a decrease in sleep quality during quarantine. Factors associated with a reduction in sleep quality by logistic regression were sleep reduction (OR 15.52 p\u003C0.001), going to bed later (OR 1.72 p\u003C0.001), getting up earlier (2.18 p=0.01), an increase in sleep-wake irregularity (OR 2.29 p\u003C0.001), reduced exposure to daylight (OR 1.46 p=0.01) and increased screen use in the evenings (OR 1.33 p=0.04). Conclusion: Sleep quality tended to reduce during quarantine and this was associated with changes in sleep behaviours and light exposure, especially in the evening.

The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT: In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. Then the sequence similarity is used as the final similarity of receptors according to the prediction results. The 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) are used to assess the prediction performance of our method. We also compare our method with other three competing methods (BRWH, LapRLS, CMF). CONLUSION: The experiment results show that IILLS achieves the AUC values of 0.8675 and 0.9061 with the 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), respectively, which illustrates that IILLS is superior to the competing methods. In addition, the case studies also further indicate that the IILLS method is effective for the virus-receptor interaction prediction.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Cheng; Duan, Guihua; Wu, Fang-Xiang; Wang, Jianxin","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67d23e2a0388959fbee3dfa60b7097acaebfe4dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6933616.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-3278-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31881820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IILLS","CMF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor GIP similarity","receptor sequence similarity","IILLS method","virus-receptor interaction prediction","hidden virus-receptor interactions","known virus-receptor interactions","receptor-binding","cross validation","similarity of viruses","new computational method","final similarity of receptors","Initial Interaction scores method","competing methods","prediction results","human viral infectious diseases","current computational methods","prediction performance","LOOCV","Gaussian Interaction Profile","viral infection of hosts","human health","experiment results","amino acid sequences of receptors","neighbors","serious threat","step","Laplacian","BRWH","LapRLS","kernel","study","CMF","BACKGROUND","Square algorithm","case studies","AUC values","addition","CONLUSION","hand"],"language":"en"},

Though for the past decade there have been numerous advancements and improvements in epitope prediction, on average the best benchmark prediction accuracies are still only around 60%. New machine learning algorithms have arisen within the domain of deep learning, text mining, and convolutional networks. This paper presents a novel analytically trained and string kernel using deep neural network, which is tailored for continuous epitope prediction, called: Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor (DRREP). RESULTS: DRREP was tested on long protein sequences from the following datasets: SARS, Pellequer, HIV, AntiJen, and SEQ194. DRREP was compared to numerous state of the art epitope predictors, including the most recently published predictors called LBtope and DMNLBE. Using area under ROC curve (AUC), DRREP achieved a performance improvement over the best performing predictors on SARS (13.7%), HIV (8.9%), Pellequer (1.5%), and SEQ194 (3.1%), with its performance being matched only on the AntiJen dataset, by the LBtope predictor, where both DRREP and LBtope achieved an AUC of 0.702. CONCLUSION: DRREP is an analytically trained deep neural network, thus capable of learning in a single step through regression. By combining the features of deep learning, string kernels, and convolutional networks, the system is able to perform residue-by-residue prediction of continues epitopes with higher accuracy than the current state of the art predictors.","publish_time":"2017-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sher, Gene; Zhi, Degui; Zhang, Shaojie","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12329a694934f5824e1ef7d695a7a1fa0310f52c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5629616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984193/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4024-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pellequer","LBtope"],"organizations":["DRREP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DRREP","domain of deep learning","features of deep learning","art epitope predictors","continuous epitope prediction","residue prediction","deep neural network","art predictors","Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor","capable of learning","published predictors","LBtope predictor","best performing predictors","numerous state","best benchmark prediction accuracies","epitopes","SARS","convolutional networks","HIV","AUC","ability","Pellequer","SEQ194","New machine learning algorithms","numerous advancements","string kernels","current state","performance improvement","AntiJen dataset","long protein sequences","average","following datasets","text mining","vaccine development","enormous role","higher accuracy","terms","improvements","single step","system","ROC curve","analysis","area","novel","past decade","regression","DMNLBE","question","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","paper","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with FIP were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human AGP, FCoV and myeloid antigens. Diffuse fAGPrP positivity within the lesions, likely due to vascular plasma leakage, endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable. Compared to controls, fAGPrP-expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes, as usually occurs for IgM-producing plasma cells during early immune responses.

In this study, we investigated the effects of PspA on cytokine and chemokine secretion from human peripheral blood monocytes and the underlying intracellular signaling mechanisms. Stimulation of monocytes with purified PspA protein induced the significant release of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokines including CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5. Products from PspA-deficient mutant pneumococcus that did not express PspA induced significantly less secretion of these mediators than those from wild type pneumococcus. Further investigations showed that PspA activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB signaling pathways in human monocytes. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways using selective inhibitors could significantly reduce the cytokine and chemokine secretion induced by PspA.

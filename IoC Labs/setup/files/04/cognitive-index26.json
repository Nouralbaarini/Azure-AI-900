Global transcriptional profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays was therefore performed on liver biopsies from patients with cirrhosis caused by either chronic alcohol consumption or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). RESULTS: Global gene expression patterns varied significantly depending upon etiology of liver disease, with a greater number of differentially regulated genes seen in HCV-infected patients. Many of the gene expression changes specifically observed in HCV-infected cirrhotic livers were expectedly associated with activation of the innate antiviral immune response. We also compared severity (CTP class) of cirrhosis for each etiology and identified gene expression patterns that differentiated ethanol-induced cirrhosis by class. CTP class A ethanol-cirrhotic livers showed unique expression patterns for genes implicated in the inflammatory response, including those related to macrophage activation and migration, as well as lipid metabolism and oxidative stress genes. CONCLUSION: Stages of liver cirrhosis could be differentiated based on gene expression patterns in ethanol-induced, but not HCV-induced, disease. In addition to genes specifically regulating the innate antiviral immune response, mechanisms responsible for differentiating chronic liver damage due to HCV or ethanol may be closely related to regulation of lipid metabolism and to effects of macrophage activation on deposition of extracellular matrix components.","publish_time":"2006-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lederer, Sharon L; Walters, Kathie-Anne; Proll, Sean; Paeper, Bryan; Robinzon, Shahar; Boix, Loreto; Fausto, Nelson; Bruix, Jordi; Katze, Michael G","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86fe00ed292aab3fd191a7f8253d33dad3be59b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1676004.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1676004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ethanol-induced cirrhosis","Global gene expression patterns","unique expression patterns","Stages of liver cirrhosis","etiology of liver disease","gene expression changes","chronic liver damage","hepatitis C virus induced liver disease","liver biopsies","HCV-infected patients","HCV-infected cirrhotic livers","ethanol-cirrhotic livers","regulated genes","CTP class","chronic hepatitis C virus","innate antiviral immune response","chronic alcohol consumption","effects of macrophage activation","oxidative stress genes","inflammatory response","regulation of lipid metabolism","Global transcriptional profiling","mechanisms responsible","oligonucleotide microarrays","deposition of extracellular matrix components","similarities","greater number","differences","migration","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","severity","molecular level","addition","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we have analyzed the magnitude and breadth of Gag-specific T-lymphocyte and antibody responses elicited in Rhesus macaques after immunization with DNA encoding a human LAMP/gag (hLAMP/gag) chimera. ELISPOT analyses indicated that the average Gag-specific IFN-\u03B3 response elicited by the hLAMP/gag chimera was detectable after only two or three naked DNA immunizations in all five immunized macaques and reached an average of 1000 spot-forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMCs. High IFN-\u03B3 ELISPOT responses were detected in CD8(\u002B)-depleted cells, indicating that CD4(\u002B) T-cells play a major role in these responses. The T-cell responses of four of the macaques were also tested by use of ELISPOT to 12 overlapping 15-amino acids (aa) peptide pools containing ten peptides each, encompassing the complete Gag protein sequence. The two Mamu 08 immunized macaques responded to eight and twelve of the pools, the Mamu B01 to six, and the other macaque to five pools indicating that the hLAMP/gag DNA antigen formulation elicits a broad T-cell response against Gag. Additionally, there was a strong HIV-1-specific IgG response. The IgG antibody titers increased after each DNA injection, indicating a strong amnestic B-cell response, and were highly elevated in all the macaques after three immunizations. Moreover, the serum of each macaque recognized 13 of the 49 peptides of a 20-aa peptide library covering the complete Gag amino acid sequence. In addition, HIV-1-specific IgA antibodies were present in the plasma and external secretions, including nasal washes. These data support the findings of increased immunogenicity of genetic vaccines encoded as LAMP chimeras, including the response to DNA vaccines by non-human primates.","publish_time":"2006-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chikhlikar, Priya; de Arruda, Luciana Barros; Maciel, Milton; Silvera, Peter; Lewis, Mark G.; August, J.

Consequently, the regulation of DC maturation should reflect these multifaceted immunological processes. In the present study, we have defined the role of particular cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and T lymphocytes in the porcine monocyte-derived DC (MoDC). Interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) alone was a poor inducer of MoDC maturation, but in association with tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), or TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid I:C, an up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II and CD80/86 expression was noted, along with reduced endocytic activity. In contrast, TNF-\u03B1 alone or in combination with the TLR ligands was a poor inducer of DC maturation, but co-operated with T-lymphocytes in the presence of antigen to induce DC maturation. Natural interferon producing cells (NIPC, or plasmacytoid DCs) represent a danger-recognition system of the immune defences, and can respond to viruses not otherwise recognized as posing a danger. Indeed, MoDC did not respond to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), whereas NIPC produced high levels of IFN-\u03B1 and TNF-\u03B1 after TGEV stimulation. Moreover, supernatants from the stimulated NIPC induced maturation in MoDCs. These matured MoDCs displayed an enhanced ability to present antigen to and thus stimulate T cells. Taken together, the present work demonstrates that maturation of MoDC not only results from TLR signalling, but can require co-operation with various cell types \u2013 principally NIPC and activated T cells \u2013 which would reflect the particular immunological situation.","publish_time":"2006-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guzylack-Piriou, Laurence; Piersma, Sytse; McCullough, Kenneth; Summerfield, Artur","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b147662e0cca0c5323e0b55508c4b54c32bf706.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1782262.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1782262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR","NIPC","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maturation of MoDC","TNF-\u03B1","regulation of DC maturation","IFN-\u03B1","Interferon-\u03B1","poor inducer of DC maturation","Maturation of dendritic cells","poor inducer of MoDC maturation","TLR ligands","stimulated NIPC induced maturation","T lymphocytes","T-lymphocytes","activated T cells","tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1","TLR signalling","porcine monocyte-derived DC","particular immunological situation","multifaceted immunological processes","present work","present study","key immunological process","immune responses","immune defences","presence of antigen","TGEV stimulation","matured MoDCs","Natural interferon","autoimmune processes","high levels of IFN","role of particular cytokines","danger-recognition system","regulation of major histocompatibility complex","receptor","association","co-operation","pathogens","various cell types","Toll","lipopolysaccharide","polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid","plasmacytoid DCs","CD80","vaccines","enhanced ability","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","supernatants","combination","expression","tolerance","reduced endocytic activity","contrast","viruses"],"language":"en"},

To carry out analysis of intra-strand nucleotide distribution several graphical methods have been developed. RESULTS: GraphDNA is a new Java application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for the visualization of DNA nucleotide composition. The program accepts GenBank, EMBL and FASTA files as an input, and it displays multiple DNA nucleotide composition graphs (skews and walks) in a single window to allow direct comparisons between the sequences. We illustrate the use of DNA skews for characterization of poxvirus and coronavirus genomes.

Covalent binding of ubiquitin or Ubls to substrate proteins can be reversed by specific hydrolases. One particular set of cysteine proteases, the CE clan, which targets ubiquitin and Ubls, has homologs in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. FINDINGS: We have cloned and analyzed the E. coli protein elaD, which is distantly related to eukaryotic CE clan members of the ULP/SENP protease family that are specific for SUMO and Nedd8. Previously misannotated as a putative sulfatase/phosphatase, elaD is an efficient and specific deubiquitinating enzyme in vitro. Interestingly, elaD is present in all intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, but conspicuously absent from extraintestinal pathogenic strains (ExPECs). Further homologs of this protease can be found in Acanthamoeba Polyphaga Mimivirus, and in Alpha-, Beta-and Gammaproteobacteria. CONCLUSION: The expression of ULP/SENP-related hydrolases in bacteria therefore extends to plant pathogens and medically relevant strains of Escherichia coli, Legionella pneumophila, Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae, and Salmonellae, in which the elaD ortholog sseL has recently been identified as a virulence factor with deubiquitinating activity. As a counterpoint, our phylogenetic and functional examination reveals that ancient eukaryotic ULP/SENP proteases also have the potential of ubiquitin-specific hydrolysis, suggesting an early common origin of this peptidase clan.","publish_time":"2007-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Catic, Andr\u00E9; Misaghi, Shahram; Korbel, Gregory A.; Ploegh, Hidde L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/305cf1019ca9c81126b2e527fedf79969c2c522f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1847702.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1847702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ubiquitin","E. coli"],"organizations":["ULP/SENP","SUMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli strains","potential of ubiquitin","specific hydrolases","coli protein elaD","SENP proteases","specific hydrolysis","SENP-related hydrolases","specific deubiquitinating enzyme","Covalent binding of ubiquitin","ancient eukaryotic ULP","expression of ULP","relevant strains of Escherichia coli","extraintestinal pathogenic strains","SENP protease family","eukaryotic CE clan members","peptidase clan","Ubls","elaD ortholog sseL","eukaryotes","homologs","substrate proteins","deubiquitinating activity","particular set of cysteine proteases","Legionella pneumophila","Rickettsiae","functional examination","early common origin","Alpha","phosphatase","plant pathogens","Chlamydiae","putative sulfatase","Salmonellae","ExPECs","SUMO","Acanthamoeba Polyphaga Mimivirus","counterpoint","virulence factor","prokaryotes","Beta","Gammaproteobacteria","viruses","polypeptides","CONCLUSION","Nedd8","BACKGROUND","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Soluble forms of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) fusion (F) proteins, devoid of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, were produced in allantoic fluids using the Sendai minigenome system. The first step was rescuing in cell cultures Sendai virus minigenomes encoding the proteins of interest, with the help of wild type Sendai virus. The second step was propagating such recombinant defective viruses, together with the helper virus, in the allantoic cavity of chicken embryonated eggs, and passage to optimize protein production.

Improved identification of risk factors might enable targeted intervention. Therefore we carried out a case-control study with the aim of identifying environmental risk factors for ARTI consultations in the Dutch general population. METHODS: A subset of patients visiting their GP in the period of 2000\u20132003 with an ARTI (cases) and age-matched controls (visiting for other complaints) were included in a case-control study. They were asked to complete a questionnaire about potential risk factors. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio\u0027s (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate the independent effect of potential risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 493 matched pairs of case and control subjects were enrolled. Exposure to persons with respiratory complaints, both inside and outside the household, was found to be an independent risk factor for visiting a GP with an ARTI (respectively OR(adj )= 1.9 and OR(adj )= 3.7). Participants exposed to dampness or mould at home (OR(adj)=0.5) were significantly less likely to visit their GP. In accordance with the general risk of consultations for ARTI, participants with a laboratory-confirmed ARTI who were exposed to persons with respiratory complaints outside the household were also significantly more likely to visit their GP (OR(adj)=2.5). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that heterogeneity in the general population as well as in pathogens causing ARTI makes it complicated to detect associations between potential risk factors and respiratory infections. Whereas it may be difficult to intervene on the risk posed by exposure to persons with respiratory complaints, transmission of ARTI in the general population might be reduced by improved hygienic conditions.","publish_time":"2007-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B; van der Sande, Marianne AB; Heijnen, Marie-Louise A; Peeters, Marcel F; Bartelds, Aad IM; Wilbrink, Berry","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1871593.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1871593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARTI consultations","environmental risk factors","general risk of consultations","transmission of ARTI","respiratory complaints","Improved identification of risk factors","GP","adj","independent effect of potential risk factors","independent risk factor","respiratory infections","persons","case-control study","Dutch general population","Acute respiratory tract infections","matched pairs of case","control subjects","Participants","Exposure","household","age-matched controls","aim","associations","important public health problem","total","mould","BACKGROUND","cases","heterogeneity","subset of patients","targeted intervention","Conditional logistic regression","dampness","home","accordance","pathogens","laboratory","questionnaire","odds ratio\u0027s","confidence intervals","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","period","hygienic conditions"],"language":"en"},

Since explicit models of the incubation period enhance our understanding of the spread of disease, previous classic studies were revisited, focusing on the modeling methods employed and paying particular attention to relatively unknown historical efforts. The earliest study on the incubation period of pandemic influenza was published in 1919, providing estimates of the incubation period of Spanish flu using the daily incidence on ships departing from several ports in Australia. Although the study explicitly dealt with an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure, which had an equal probability of infection, were too long, and thus, likely resulted in slight underestimates of the incubation period. After the suggestion that the incubation period follows lognormal distribution, Japanese epidemiologists extended this assumption to estimates of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak. Although the reason why the incubation period of acute infectious diseases tends to reveal a right-skewed distribution has been explored several times, the validity of the lognormal assumption is yet to be fully clarified. At present, various different distributions are assumed, and the lack of validity in assuming lognormal distribution is particularly apparent in the case of slowly progressing diseases. The present paper indicates that (1) analysis using well-defined short periods of exposure with appropriate statistical methods is critical when the exact time of exposure is unknown, and (2) when assuming a specific distribution for the incubation period, comparisons using different distributions are needed in addition to estimations using different datasets, analyses of the determinants of incubation period, and an understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.","publish_time":"2007-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"Emerg Themes Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98d0756af42f78bb74a9df2846729c36ba2f05ad.json; document_parses/pdf_json/37fe4be4d997e01fa069ab31bbe1a0090356500a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1884151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["determinants of incubation period","incubation period of infectious diseases","incubation period of Spanish flu","incubation period of pandemic influenza","incubation period of acute infectious diseases","unknown time of exposure","lognormal distribution","exact time of exposure","assumed periods of exposure","specific distribution","lognormal assumption","well-defined short periods of exposure","spread of disease","different datasets","understanding","various different distributions","right-skewed distribution","onset of disease","unknown historical efforts","underlying disease mechanisms","modeling methods","lack of validity","earliest study","present paper","appropriate statistical methods","equal probability of infection","particular attention","analyses","Japanese epidemiologists","ships","daily incidence","estimations","analysis","addition","comparisons","previous classic studies","times","microorganism","point source outbreak","ports","prevention","case","explicit models","slight underestimates","reason","suggestion","control","Australia"],"language":"en"},

The small and medium business sector is a major provider of private sector employment in Australia, yet we have little information about the preparedness of this sector for pandemic influenza. This study aimed to investigate the association between individual perceptions and preparedness for pandemic influenza among small and medium business owners and managers. METHODS: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 201 small and medium business owners or managers in New South Wales and Western Australia. Eligible small or medium businesses were defined as those that had less than 200 employees. Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of having considered the impact of, having a plan for, and needing help to prepare for pandemic influenza. RESULTS: Approximately 6 per cent of participants reported that their business had a plan for pandemic influenza, 39 per cent reported that they had not thought at all about the impact of pandemic influenza on their business, and over 60 per cent stated that they required help to prepare for a pandemic. Beliefs about the severity of pandemic influenza and the ability to respond were significant independent predictors of having a plan for pandemic influenza, and the perception of the risk of pandemic influenza was the most important predictor of both having considered the impact of, and needing help to prepare for a pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that small and medium businesses in Australia are not currently well prepared for pandemic influenza. We found that beliefs about the risk, severity, and the ability to respond effectively to the threat of pandemic influenza are important predictors of preparedness. Campaigns targeting small and medium businesses should emphasise the severity of the consequences to their businesses if a pandemic were to occur, and, at the same time, reassure them that there are effective strategies capable of being implemented by small and medium businesses to deal with a pandemic.","publish_time":"2007-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watkins, Rochelle E; Cooke, Feonagh C; Donovan, Robert J; MacIntyre, C Raina; Itzwerth, Ralf; Plant, Aileen J","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25a348f34236403317091db876b29fd5063528ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1934907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1934907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["severity of pandemic influenza","impact of pandemic influenza","risk of pandemic influenza","threat of pandemic influenza","medium businesses","medium business sector","medium business owners","important predictors of preparedness","plan","help","managers","Community-wide preparedness","Western Australia","ability","Beliefs","cent of participants","significant independent predictors","major provider of private sector employment","New South Wales","individual perceptions","Semi-structured face-to-face interviews","priority","METHODS","association","findings","little information","Binomial logistic regression analysis","health authorities","countries","BACKGROUND","consequences","Campaigns","issue","effective strategies capable","recent news media","CONCLUSION","study","RESULTS","employees","time"],"language":"en"},

Using the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) frameshift region, we found that mutating the E-site codon altered the -1 PRF efficiency. When the HIV-1 slippery sequence was replaced with other viral slippery sequences, mutating the E-site codon also altered the -1 PRF efficiency. Because HIV-1 -1 PRF can be recapitulated in bacteria, we used a bacterial ribosome system to select, by random mutagenesis, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) mutations that modify the expression of a reporter requiring HIV-1 -1 PRF. Three mutants were isolated, which are located in helices 21 and 22 of 16S rRNA, a region involved in translocation and E-site tRNA binding.

RESULTS: We expressed dCAT-1 or mCAT-1 of NIH 3T3 origin in cells that are not normally infectible with ecotropic MLVs and evaluated the transfectants for susceptibility to virus infection and to virus-induced syncytium formation. The dCAT-1 transfectants, but not the mCAT-1 transfectants, were susceptible to virus-induced cytopathicity, and this cytopathic response was accompanied by the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA. The dCAT-1 transfectants, however, did not also reproduce the relative resistance of M. dunni cells to Moloney MLV, and the mCAT-1 transfectants did not show the relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Spl574. Western analysis, use of glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove receptor glycosylation sites identified a possible role for cell-specific glycosylation in the modulation of virus entry. CONCLUSION: Virus entry and virus-induced syncytium formation using the CAT-1 receptor are mediated by a small number of critical amino acid residues in receptor and virus Env. Virus entry is modulated by glycosylation of cellular proteins, and this effect is cell and virus-specific.","publish_time":"2008-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Yuhe; Jung, Yong T; Wu, Tiyun; Kozak, Christine A","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20d1c063410f32eb59b3f3063d506c4888c80bec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2248597.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2248597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus Env","virus-specific","virus infection","virus-induced cytopathicity","cell surface virus receptor","modulation of virus entry","transfectants","receptor variant","virus-induced syncytium formation","dunni cells","dCAT","receptor glycosylation sites","receptor interaction","Friend mouse leukemia virus F-S MLV","cell-specific glycosylation","mCAT","Moloney variant Spl574","relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells","glycosylation inhibitors","variant CAT","Moloney MLV","Friend ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses","glycosylation of cellular proteins","host range","wild mouse species Mus dunni","critical env residue","unusual variants of Moloney","NIH 3T3 origin","small number of critical amino acid residues","different amino acid substitutions","possible role","ecotropic MLVs","cytopathic response","S84A","S82F","effect","mutagenesis","susceptibility","accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA","Western analysis","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Several studies suggest that CTL clones can recognize highly diverse peptides, some sharing no obvious sequence identity. The emerging realization in the field is that T cell receptors (TcR) recognize multiple distinct ligands. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, we analyzed peptide scans of the HIV epitope SLFNTVATL (SFL9) and found that TCR specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition. Inspired by this, we developed a general model of TCR peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross-reactivity of a diverse set of CTL epitopes. With this model, we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct T cell epitopes, i.e., ones with low sequence identity, are in fact more biochemically similar than expected. Additionally, an analysis of HIV immunogenicity data with our model showed that CTLs have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self-antigens. CONCLUSIONS: T cell cross-reactivity can thus, to an extent greater than earlier appreciated, be explained by amino acid similarity. The results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long-lasting discussions in the field of T cell cross-reactivity.","publish_time":"2008-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frankild, Sune; de Boer, Rob J.; Lund, Ole; Nielsen, Morten; Kesmir, Can","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aae7699e079d2964df8078931cd0f94d4b1423d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2263130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2263130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cytotoxic T","CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of T cell cross-reactivity","mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity","T cell receptors","Cytotoxic T cell","distinct T cell epitopes","CTL clones","general model of TCR peptide recognition","diverse set of CTL epitopes","amino acid similarity matrices","similar amino acid substitutions","TCR specificity","diverse peptides","low sequence identity","obvious sequence identity","peptide scans","extent greater","HIV epitope SLFNTVATL","multiple distinct ligands","analysis of HIV immunogenicity data","immune responses","SFL9","fact","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","pivotal role","long-lasting discussions","CTLs","tendency","emerging realization","self-antigens","studies","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","results","paper"],"language":"en"},

Gammaherpesvirus infections usually result in either a productive lytic infection, characterized by expression of all viral genes and rapid cell lysis, or latent infection, characterized by limited viral gene expression and no cell lysis. Here, we report characterization of endothelial cell infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (\u03B3HV68), a virus phylogenetically related and biologically similar to the human gammaherpesviruses. Endothelial cells supported \u03B3HV68 replication in vitro, but were unique in that a significant proportion of the cells escaped lysis, proliferated, and remained viable in culture for an extended time. Upon infection, endothelial cells became non-adherent and altered in size, complexity, and cell-surface protein expression. These cells were uniformly infected and expressed the lytic transcription program based on detection of abundant viral gene transcripts, GFP fluorescence from the viral genome, and viral surface protein expression. Additionally, endothelial cells continued to produce new infectious virions as late as 30 days post-infection. The outcome of this long-term infection was promoted by the \u03B3HV68 v-cyclin, because in the absence of the v-cyclin, viability was significantly reduced following infection. Importantly, infected primary endothelial cells also demonstrated increased viability relative to infected primary fibroblasts, and this increased viability was dependent on the v-cyclin. Finally, we provide evidence for infection of endothelial cells in vivo in immune-deficient mice. The extended viability and virus production of infected endothelial cells indicated that endothelial cells provided a source of prolonged virus production and identify a cell-type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication. While infected endothelial cells would likely be cleared in a healthy individual, persistently infected endothelial cells could provide a source of continued virus replication in immune-compromised individuals, a context in which gammaherpesvirus-associated pathology frequently occurs.","publish_time":"2008-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su\u00E1rez, Andrea Lu\u00EDsa; van Dyk, Linda Faye","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c851a889568efd469f724ebacfe3270946f3e04f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2526176.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2526176/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of endothelial cells","infected primary endothelial cells","virus production of infected endothelial cells","characterization of endothelial cell infection","latent infection","long-term infection","following infection","viral gene expression","productive lytic infection","days post-infection","viral surface protein expression","cell-surface protein expression","viral genome","viral genes","rapid cell lysis","infected primary fibroblasts","extended viability","\u03B3HV68 replication","\u03B3HV68 v-cyclin","source of continued virus replication","cell-type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication","murine gammaherpesvirus","Gammaherpesvirus infections","increased viability relative","gammaherpesvirus-associated pathology","source of prolonged virus production","detection of abundant viral gene transcripts","human gammaherpesviruses","extended time","immune-compromised individuals","immune-deficient mice","lytic transcription program","variety of human diseases","GFP fluorescence","context","complexity","Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma","new infectious virions","neoplasms of lymphocytes","size","significant proportion","healthy individual","culture","absence","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma","evidence","outcome"],"language":"en"},

Host responses to these toxins are complex and poorly understood. We find that the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated upon exposure to PFTs both in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian cells. Activation of the UPR is protective in vivo against PFTs since animals that lack either the ire-1-xbp-1 or the atf-6 arms of the UPR are more sensitive to PFT than wild-type animals. The UPR acts directly in the cells targeted by the PFT. Loss of the UPR leads to a normal response against unrelated toxins or a pathogenic bacterium, indicating its PFT-protective role is specific. The p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinase pathway has been previously shown to be important for cellular defenses against PFTs. We find here that the UPR is one of the key downstream targets of the p38 MAPK pathway in response to PFT since loss of a functional p38 MAPK pathway leads to a failure of PFT to properly activate the ire-1-xbp-1 arm of the UPR. The UPR-mediated activation and response to PFTs is distinct from the canonical UPR-mediated response to unfolded proteins both in terms of its activation and functional sensitivities. These data demonstrate that the UPR, a fundamental intracellular pathway, can operate in intrinsic cellular defenses against bacterial attack.","publish_time":"2008-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bischof, Larry J.; Kao, Cheng-Yuan; Los, Ferdinand C.

Type I viruses, which are prevalent in the field but are difficult to isolate and propagate in cell culture, and type II viruses, which are less prevalent but replicate well in cell culture. An important determinant of coronavirus infection, in vivo and in cell culture, is the interaction of the virus surface glycoprotein with a cellular receptor. It is generally accepted that feline aminopeptidase N can act as a receptor for the attachment and entry of type II strains, and it has been proposed that the same molecule acts as a receptor for type I viruses. However, the experimental data are inconclusive. The aim of the studies reported here was to provide evidence for or against the involvement of feline aminopeptidase N as a receptor for type I feline coronaviruses. Our approach was to produce retroviral pseudotypes that bear the type I or type II feline coronavirus surface glycoprotein and to screen a range of feline cell lines for the expression of a functional receptor for attachment and entry. Our results show that type I feline coronavirus surface glycoprotein fails to recognize feline aminopeptidase N as a functional receptor on three continuous feline cell lines. This suggests that feline aminopeptidase N is not a receptor for type I feline coronaviruses.

In this study, we conducted a lentiviral vector with a H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassette to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells. Using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as surrogate marker, stable shRNA-expressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed siRNAs targeting to conserved regions of influenza A virus genome were assessed. The results showed that a siRNA targeting influenza M2 gene (siM2) potently inhibited viral replication. The siM2 was not only effective for H1N1 virus but also for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In addition to its M2 inhibition, the siM2 also inhibited NP mRNA accumulation and protein expression. A long term inhibition effect of the siM2 was demonstrated and the emergence of siRNA-resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed.

They are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, which are characterized by sequencing the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. Given the increased interest for novel HRV strain identification and their worldwide distribution, we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of HRV strains in a 2-year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in Shanghai. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We cloned and sequenced a 924-nt fragment that covered part of the 5\u2032UTR and the VP4/VP2 capsid genes. Sixty-four HRV-infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection. Two samples were co-infected with HRV-A and HRV-B or HRV-C. By comparative analysis of the VP4/VP2 sequences of the 66 HRVs, we showed a high diversity of strains in HRV-A and HRV-B species, and a prevalence of 51.5% of strains that belonged to the recently identified HRV-C species. When analyzing a fragment of the 5\u2032 UTR, we characterized at least two subspecies of HRV-C: HRV-Cc, which clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and HRV-Ca, which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to HRV-A. The full-length sequence of one strain of each HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis. We confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2A gene and 3\u2032UTR of the HRV-Ca strain. Double or triple infections with HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients, but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high diversity of HRV strains that cause bronchitis and pneumonia in children. A predominance of HRV-C over HRV-A and HRV-B was observed, and two subspecies of HRV-C were identified, the diversity of which seemed to be related to recombination with former HRV-A strains. None of the HRV-C strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than HRV-A or HRV-B on respiratory compromise.","publish_time":"2009-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Ting; Wang, Wei; Bessaud, Mael; Ren, Peijun; Sheng, Jun; Yan, Huajie; Zhang, Jing; Lin, Xin; Wang, Yongjin; Delpeyroux, Francis; Deubel, Vincent","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d095d0275e474dbb9d9b63a75591ff2c0667d73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2712091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2712091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subspecies of HRV","predominance of HRV","HRV-C strains","HRV-C species","HRV-B species","HRV-Ca strain","HRV-Cc subspecies","HRV-infected patients","HRV-infected outpatients","high diversity of HRV strains","molecular diagnosis of HRV strains","novel HRV strain identification","UTR","high diversity of strains","respiratory compromise","VP4","VP2 region","prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection","acute low respiratory tract infection","VP2 sequences","respiratory syncytial virus","year study of children","HRVs","previous recombination","comparative analysis","untranslated region","higher clinical impact","VP2 capsid genes","severity of clinical outcome","apparent additional recombination events","nt fragment","structural proteins","correlation","district hospital","worldwide distribution","bronchitis","triple infections","pneumonia","full-length sequence","close relationship","BACKGROUND","Human rhinoviruses","Shanghai","bocavirus","genome","samples","prevalence","CONCLUSION","METHODOLOGY","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Selective COX-2 inhibition is effective in CRC prevention, although having adverse cardiovascular effects, thus focus has shifted to downstream pathways. METHODS: Microarray experiments identified genes regulated by COX-2 in HCA7 CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo regulation of DRAK2 (DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2 or STK17\u03B2, an apoptosis-inducing kinase) by COX-2 was validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Inhibition of COX-2 induced apoptosis and enhanced DRAK2 expression in HCA7 cells (4.4-fold increase at 4 h by qRT-PCR, P=0.001), an effect prevented by co-administration of PGE(2). DRAK2 levels were suppressed in a panel of human colorectal tumours (n=10) compared to normal mucosa, and showed inverse correlation with COX-2 expression (R=\u22120.68, R(2)=0.46, P=0.03). Administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib to patients with CRC (n=5) induced DRAK2 expression in tumours (2.5-fold increase, P=0.01). In vitro silencing of DRAK2 by RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival following COX-2 inhibitor treatment. CONCLUSION: DRAK2 is a serine\u2013threonine kinase implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and is negatively regulated by COX-2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism for the effect of COX-2 on cancer cell survival.","publish_time":"2009-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doherty, G A; Byrne, S M; Austin, S C; Scully, G M; Sadlier, D M; Neilan, T G; Kay, E W; Murray, F E; Fitzgerald, D J","journal":"Br J Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b4c47bbc2473d07c8ffd4d940a099e7546b9f25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2720240.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Inhibition of COX","effect of COX","Selective COX","regulation of DRAK2","enhanced DRAK2 expression","silencing of DRAK2","regulation of apoptosis","induced apoptosis","DRAK2 levels","HCA7 CRC cells","CRC prevention","DAP kinase-related apoptosis","threonine kinase","HCA7 cells","RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival","cancer cell survival","fold increase","colorectal cancer","qRT-PCR","tumour cells resistant","inhibitor rofecoxib","panel of human colorectal tumours","inhibitor treatment","co-administration of PGE","focus","inverse correlation","patients","adverse cardiovascular effects","Microarray experiments","genes","serine","STK17\u03B2","normal mucosa","METHODS","novel mechanism","downstream pathways","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","Cyclooxygenase","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It is thought that this dramatic disease emergence is primarily the result of the social, demographic, and environmental transformation that has occurred globally since World War II. However, the causal linkages have not been elucidated. Investigating emerging zoonotic pathogens as an ecological phenomenon can provide significant insights as to why some of these pathogens have jumped species and caused major epidemics in humans. A review of concepts and theory from biological ecology and of causal factors in disease emergence previously described suggests a general model of global zoonotic disease emergence. The model links demographic and societal factors to land use and land cover change whose associated ecological factors help explain disease emergence. The scale and magnitude of these changes are more significant than those associated with climate change, the effects of which are largely not yet understood. Unfortunately, the complex character and non-linear behavior of the human-natural systems in which host-pathogen systems are embedded makes specific incidences of disease emergence or epidemics inherently difficult to predict. Employing a complex systems analytical approach, however, may show how a few key ecological variables and system properties, including the adaptive capacity of institutions, explains the emergence of infectious diseases and how an integrated, multi-level approach to zoonotic disease control can reduce risk.","publish_time":"2005-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilcox, Bruce A.; Gubler, Duane J.","journal":"Environ Health Prev Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/caf154a8f440a382fc43fbf45eb471c954af4d00.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723410/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dramatic disease emergence","zoonotic disease control","specific incidences of disease emergence","general model of global zoonotic disease emergence","emergence of infectious diseases","associated ecological factors","causal factors","emerging zoonotic pathogens","societal factors","ecological phenomenon","complex systems analytical approach","frequency of epidemic transmission of zoonotic diseases","human-natural systems","host-pathogen systems","key ecological variables","model links demographic","land cover","major epidemics","complex character","significant insights","causal linkages","climate change","multi-level approach","system properties","biological ecology","use","non-linear behavior","theory","result","adaptive capacity of institutions","species","review of concepts","environmental transformation","magnitude","changes","humans","risk","scale","effects","World War","years"],"language":"en"},

To understand the molecular pathogenesis of these infections, we searched for cellular targets of the virulence protein C of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3-C). We found that hPIV3-C interacts directly through its C-terminal domain with STAT1 and GRB2, whereas C proteins from measles or Nipah viruses failed to do so. Binding to STAT1 explains the previously reported capacity of hPIV3-C to block type I interferon signaling, but the interaction with GRB2 was unexpected. This adaptor protein bridges Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor to MAPK/ERK pathway, a signaling cascade recently found to be involved in airway inflammatory response. We report that either hPIV3 infection or transient expression of hPIV3-C both increase cellular response to EGF, as assessed by Elk1 transactivation and phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 and translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 prevented viral protein expression in infected cells. Altogether, our data provide molecular basis to explain the role of hPIV3-C as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis and demonstrate that Paramyxoviridae have evolved a single virulence factor to block type I interferon signaling and to boost simultaneous cellular response to growth factors.","publish_time":"2009-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caignard, Gr\u00E9gory; Komarova, Anastassia V.; Boura\u00EF, Mehdi; Mourez, Thomas; Jacob, Yves; Jones, Louis M.; Rozenberg, Flore; Vabret, Astrid; Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois; Tangy, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe2000f280297c40bc53ce95d703a9ca6aac19fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2736567.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2736567/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hPIV3-C","C proteins","hPIV3 infection","role of hPIV3","C-terminal domain","virulence protein C of human parainfluenza virus type","transient expression of hPIV3","single virulence factor","reported capacity of hPIV3","block type","viral protein expression","simultaneous cellular response","adaptor protein bridges Epidermal Growth Factor","translation initiation factor","EGF","ERK pathway","cellular targets","STAT1","interferon","GRB2","airway inflammatory response","molecular pathogenesis","S ribosomal subunit protein S6","airway inflammation","growth factors","inhibition of MAPK","determinant of pathogenesis","molecular basis","acute respiratory infections","children","U0126","receptor","phosphorylation levels of ERK1","immuno-compromised individuals","exacerbation of chronic diseases","Elk1 transactivation","measles","Paramyxoviridae","infected cells","number of paramyxoviruses","eIF4E","Nipah viruses","asthma","interaction","data","Binding","cascade"],"language":"en"},

Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer\u0027s disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as \u2018physiological\u2019 is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.

It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups.

Viral diversity is high in aPMV-1; eight genotypes are recognized based on phylogenetic reconstruction of gene sequences. Modified live vaccines have been developed to decrease the economic losses caused by this virus. Vaccines derived from avirulent genotype II strains were developed in the 1950s and are in use globally, whereas Australian strains belonging to genotype I were developed as vaccines in the 1970s and are used mainly in Asia. In this study, we evaluated the consequences of attenuated live virus vaccination on the evolution of aPMV-1 genotypes. There was phylogenetic incongruence among trees based on individual genes and complete coding region of 54 full length aPMV-1 genomes, suggesting that recombinant sequences were present in the data set. Subsequently, five recombinant genomes were identified, four of which contained sequences from either genotype I or II. The population history of vaccine-related genotype II strains was distinct from other aPMV-1 genotypes; genotype II emerged in the late 19(th) century and is evolving more slowly than other genotypes, which emerged in the 1960s. Despite vaccination efforts, genotype II viruses have experienced constant population growth to the present. In contrast, other contemporary genotypes showed population declines in the late 1990s. Additionally, genotype I and II viruses, which are circulating in the presence of homotypic vaccine pressure, have unique selection profiles compared to nonvaccine-related strains. Collectively, these data show that vaccination with live attenuated viruses has changed the evolution of aPMV-1 by maintaining a large effective population size of a vaccine-related genotype, allowing for coinfection and recombination of vaccine and wild type strains, and by applying unique selective pressures on viral glycoproteins.","publish_time":"2010-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Yee Ling; Padhi, Abinash; Hudson, Peter J.; Poss, Mary","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ca920dabf09c2c2dd2c62f8ef5917e3bd72f087.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2858710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle Disease Virus"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["vaccine-related genotype","avirulent genotype","evolution of aPMV","length aPMV","population history of vaccine","nonvaccine-related strains","Australian strains","live vaccines","contemporary genotypes","live attenuated viruses","recombination of vaccine","recombinant sequences","consequences of attenuated live virus vaccination","wild type strains","constant population growth","vaccination efforts","Newcastle Disease Virus","recombinant genomes","presence of homotypic vaccine pressure","large effective population size","phylogenetic reconstruction of gene sequences","phylogenetic incongruence","viral glycoproteins","Viral diversity","data set","unique selection profiles","unique selective pressures","serious of disease threats","individual genes","complete coding region","trees","NDV","coinfection","pathogenic strain of avian paramyxovirus","poultry industry","contrast","century","economic losses","study","Asia"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe our first year experience of in-hospital ECLS activity, the operative algorithm and the protocol for centralization of adult patients from district hospitals. METHODS: At a tertiary referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy), an ECLS program was developed from 2008 by the Emergency Department and Heart and Vessel Department ICUs. The ECLS team consists of an intensivist, a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist and a perfusionist, all trained in ECLS technique. ECMO support was applied in case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not responsive to conventional treatments. The use of veno-arterial (V-A) ECLS for cardiac support was reserved for cases of cardiac shock refractory to standard treatment and cardiac arrests not responding to conventional resuscitation. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated with ECLS during the first year of activity. Among them, 13 received ECMO for ARDS (5 H1N1-virus related), with a 62% survival. In one case of post-traumatic ARDS, V-A ECLS support permitted multiple organ donation after cerebral death was confirmed. Patients treated with V-A ECLS due to cardiogenic shock (N = 4) had a survival rate of 50%. No patients on V-A ECLS support after cardiac arrest survived (N = 4). CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, an ECLS Service was instituted over a relatively limited period of time. A strict collaboration between different specialists can be regarded as a key feature to efficiently implement the process.","publish_time":"2010-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peris, Adriano; Cianchi, Giovanni; Biondi, Simona; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Pasquini, Andrea; Bonacchi, Massimo; Ciapetti, Marco; Zagli, Giovanni; Bacci, Simona; Lazzeri, Chiara; Bernardo, Pasquale; Mascitelli, Erminia; Sani, Guido; Gensini, Gian Franco","journal":"Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/973c821bf749ccc67a2d9020f637438b90fa5152.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2879235.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Extracorporeal Life Support","ECMO","Careggi Teaching Hospital","Vessel Department","ECLS","ARDS","V-A ECLS","ECLS Service"],"locations":["Florence"],"keyphrases":["ECLS support","ECLS Service","ECLS technique","ECLS team","ECLS program","cardiac support","hospital ECLS activity","ECMO support","cardiac arrests","cardiac surgeon","cardiac failure","Extracorporeal Life Support","cases of cardiac shock refractory","centralization of adult patients","year of activity","case of post-traumatic ARDS","case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","standard treatment","Emergency Department","cardiogenic shock","conventional treatments","conventional resuscitation","year experience","survival rate","Careggi Teaching Hospital","Vessel Department ICUs","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","tertiary referral trauma center","multiple organ donation","Italy","Florence","operative algorithm","protocol","Heart","cerebral death","district hospitals","perfusionist","intensivist","INTRODUCTION","different specialists","strict collaboration","METHODS","use of veno","cardiologist","centre","key feature","H1N1-virus","limited period of time","process","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.","publish_time":"2010-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Aihua; Umashankar, Mahadevaiah; Kielian, Margaret","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39772fc7033bdfcfd0a6fb689d7a5c8bff2d80e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2958806.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

The start codon of the BM2 ORF overlaps the stop codon of the M1 ORF in the pentanucleotide UAA UG and \u223C10% of ribosomes terminating at the M1 stop codon reinitiate translation at the overlapping AUG. BM2 synthesis requires the presence of, and translation through, 45 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG, known as the \u2018termination upstream ribosome binding site\u2019 (TURBS). This region may tether ribosomal 40S subunits to the mRNA following termination and a short region of the TURBS, motif 1, with complementarity to helix 26 of 18S rRNA has been implicated in this process. Here, we provide further evidence for a direct interaction between mRNA and rRNA using antisense oligonucleotide targeting and functional analysis in yeast cells. The TURBS also binds initiation factor eIF3 and we show here that this protein stimulates reinitiation from both wild-type and defective TURBS when added exogenously, perhaps by stabilising ribosome-mRNA interactions. Further, we show that the position of the TURBS with respect to the UAA UG overlap is crucial, and that termination too far downstream of the 18S complementary sequence inhibits the process, probably due to reduced 40S tethering. However, in reporter mRNAs where the restart codon alone is moved downstream, termination-reinitiation is inhibited but not abolished, thus the site of reinitiation is somewhat flexible. Reinitiation on distant AUGs is not inhibited in eIF4G-depleted RRL, suggesting that the tethered 40S subunit can move some distance without a requirement for linear scanning.","publish_time":"2011-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, Michael L.; Leigh, Kendra E.; P\u00F6yry, Tuija A.

In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C\u002B1871A), rs707922(G\u002B1837T) and rs805264(G\u002B203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total- and LDL- cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese. However, in T2D patients, a subset of APOM SNPs was associated with disease duration and metabolic traits. Further molecular analysis proved the functional activity of rs707922 in APOM expression and in regulation of cellular cholesterol content.","publish_time":"2011-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Jun-Wei; Tsui, Stephen K.

After its first description, continuous experimental and clinical research was performed, and three canonical pathways of activation were established. Upon activation by traumatic or surgical tissue damage, complement reveals beneficial functions of pathogen and danger defense by sensing and clearing injured cells. However, the latest research efforts have provided a more distinct insight into the complement system and its clinical subsequences. Complement has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory processes such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, ischemia/reperfusion, cardiovascular diseases and many others. The three well-known activation pathways of the complement system have been challenged by newer findings that demonstrate direct production of central complement effectors (for example, C5a) by serine proteases of the coagulation cascade. In particular, thrombin is capable of producing C5a, which not only plays a decisive role on pathogens and infected/damaged tissues, but also acts systemically. In the case of uncontrolled complement activation, \u201Cfriendly fire\u201D is generated, resulting in the destruction of healthy host tissue. Therefore, the traditional research that focuses on a mainly positive-acting cascade has now shifted to the negative effects and how tissue damage originated by the activation of the complement can be contained. In a translational approach including structure-function relations of this ancient defense system, this review provides new insights of complement-mediated clinical relevant diseases and the development of complement modulation strategies and current research aspects.","publish_time":"2010-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehrnthaller, Christian; Ignatius, Anita; Gebhard, Florian; Huber-Lang, Markus","journal":"Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64e1170eeb4f949a59dc09e714609a5c36c4122f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3060978.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complement system","case of uncontrolled complement activation","new insights of complement","clinical research","development of complement modulation strategies","direct production of central complement effectors","ancient defense system","well-known activation pathways","canonical pathways of activation","traditional research","danger defense","surgical tissue damage","clinical relevant diseases","current research aspects","clinical subsequences","coagulation cascade","latest research efforts","C5a","potent defense cascade of innate immunity","positive-acting cascade","cardiovascular diseases","decisive role","significant role","destruction of healthy host tissue","structure-function relations","multiorgan dysfunction","sepsis","ischemia","beneficial functions of pathogen","example","pathogenesis of various inflammatory processes","review","pathogens","reperfusion","sensing","serine proteases","newer findings","century","distinct insight","translational approach","description","damaged tissues","injured cells","negative effects","thrombin"],"language":"en"},

Here, we use three relatively simple models to address three issues of primary concern in the targeting of any vaccine. The advantages of such simple models are that the underlying assumptions and effects of individual parameters are relatively clear, and the impact of uncertainty in the parametrization can be readily assessed in the early stages of an outbreak. In particular, we examine whether targeting risk-groups, age-groups or spatial regions could be optimal in terms of reducing the predicted number of cases or severe effects; and how these targeted strategies vary as the epidemic progresses. We examine the conditions under which it is optimal to initially target vaccination towards those individuals within the population who are most at risk of severe effects of infection. Using age-structured mixing matrices, we show that targeting vaccination towards the more epidemiologically important age groups (5\u201314 year olds and then 15\u201324 year olds) leads to the greatest reduction in the epidemic growth and hence reduces the total number of cases. Finally, we consider how spatially targeting the vaccine towards regions of country worst affected could provide an advantage. We discuss how all three of these priorities change as both the speed at which vaccination can be deployed and the start of the vaccination programme is varied.","publish_time":"2011-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keeling, Matt J.; White, Peter J.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e40f87b34c9f1b2626fb1d4c1d76178a7900a9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3061093.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3061093/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["targeting","age-groups","vaccination programme","risk-groups","important age groups","risk of severe effects of infection","question of optimal deployment of mass vaccination campaigns","simple models","vaccine","year olds","effects of individual parameters","predicted number of cases","total number of cases","spatial regions","epidemic growth","age-structured mixing matrices","epidemic progresses","regions of country worst affected","attention","underlying assumptions","novel strain of H1N1 influenza virus","Mexico","terms","greatest reduction","targeted strategies","issues of primary concern","subsequent worldwide spread","impact of uncertainty","emergence","population","start","early stages","outbreak","parametrization","advantages","speed","individuals","priorities","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Additional items assessed included patients\u2019 perception of SARS measures and patient demographics. Of 149 patients, 97% had heard of SARS, 92% believed SARS precautions necessary, and 54% believed contracting SARS was possible despite the precautions. Patients were satisfied with doctors wearing masks (97%), temperature checks (97%), and patients wearing masks (96%). Despite the high satisfaction levels with SARS precautions, 24% believed it had adversely affected doctor\u2013patient interaction. With regards to doctor\u2013patient interaction, 94% of patients were satisfied.

Patients were most satisfied with understanding their treatment plan (100%), doctor being honest (97%) and being understood (96%). Patients were least satisfied with information about caring for their illness (61%), that the visit could be better (59%), and the doctor showing more interest (58%). On multivariate analysis, patients who were less satisfied with SARS measures were significantly less satisfied with doctor\u2013patient interaction (P = 0.0001).

Older age and non\u2010breast cancer patients were also less satisfied with doctor\u2013patient interaction. Most (94%) of patients were satisfied with doctor\u2013patient interaction, despite implementation of infectious disease prevention measures. However, patients who were dissatisfied with the SARS precautions had poorer satisfaction. In particular, physician empathy appeared to be most adversely affected.

Influenza is an underestimated contributor to morbidity and mortality. Population knowledge regarding influenza and its vaccination has a key role in enhancing vaccination coverage. OBJECTIVES. This study aimed to identify the gaps of knowledge among Jordanian population towards influenza and its vaccine, and to identify the major determinants of accepting seasonal influenza vaccine in adults and children in Jordan. METHODS. This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 941 randomly selected adults in Amman, Jordan. A four-section questionnaire was used which included questions about the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about influenza and the factors that affect seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance and refusal. RESULTS. Only 47.3% of the participants were considered knowledgeable. About half of the participants (51.9%) correctly identified the main influenza preventative measures. Lack of knowledge about the important role of seasonal influenza vaccine in disease prevention was observed. Low vaccination rate (20% of adults) was reported. The most critical barrier against vaccination in adults and children was the concern about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine, while the most important predictors for future vaccination in adults and children were physician recommendation and government role. In children, the inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program was an important determinant of vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION. Formulating new strategies to improve the population\u2019s level of knowledge, assuring the population about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine and the inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program are the essential factors to enhance vaccination coverage in Jordan.","publish_time":"2016-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abu-rish, Eman Y; Elayeh, Eman R; Mousa, Lubabah A; Butanji, Yasser K; Albsoul-Younes, Abla M","journal":"Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance","important role of seasonal influenza vaccine","children","vaccination coverage","Population knowledge","important determinant of vaccine acceptance","future vaccination","selected adults","gaps of knowledge","Lack of knowledge","main influenza preventative measures","Low vaccination rate","population\u2019s level of knowledge","national immunization program","important predictors","key role","government role","Jordanian population","efficacy","safety","inclusion","participants","essential factors","cross-sectional study","physician recommendation","questions","disease prevention","major determinants","underestimated contributor","morbidity","sociodemographic characteristics","concern","refusal","critical barrier","new strategies","mortality","Amman","section questionnaire","half","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA) each cause alkalinisation of the lumen and thus impair lysosomal function, although by distinct mechanisms. CQ diffuses into lysosomes and undergoes protonation, while BafA inhibits the ability of the vacuolar type H(\u002B)-ATPase (v-ATPase) to transfer protons into the lysosome. In the present study, we examine the impact of CQ and BafA on the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), inhibition of which is an early step in promoting autophagy. We find each compound inhibits mTORC1 signalling, without affecting levels of protein components of the mTORC1 signalling pathway. Furthermore, these effects are not related to these agents\u2019 capacity to inhibit autophagy or the reduction in amino acid supply from lysosomal proteolysis. Instead, our data indicate that the reduction in mTORC1 signalling appears to be due to the accumulation of lysosomal storage material. However, there are differences in responses to these agents, for instance, in their abilities to up-regulate direct targets of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a substrate of mTORC1 that drives transcription of many lysosomal and autophagy-related genes. Nonetheless, our data imply that widely used agents that alkalinise intralysosomal pH are mimetics of acute lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and emphasise the importance of considering the result of CQ and BafA on mTORC1 signalling when interpreting the effects of these agents on cellular physiology.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fedele, Anthony O.; Proud, Christopher G.","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b45489e57a93648e455f0ef47892355cc930a5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BafA","mTORC1 signalling pathway","substrate of mTORC1","lysosomal function","lysosomal proteolysis","impact of CQ","result of CQ","autophagy-related genes","accumulation of lysosomal storage material","mimetics of acute lysosomal storage disorders","reduction","lysosomes","effects","ATPase","data","activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex","direct targets of transcription factor EB","TFEB","amino acid supply","bafilomycin A1","intralysosomal pH","levels of protein components","ability","LSDs","acidic interior","cause alkalinisation","autophagic process","vacuolar type H","lumen","inhibition","protonation","intraluminal degradative enzymes","abilities","autophagosome","responses","instance","early step","importance","Chloroquine","distinct mechanisms","cellular physiology","agents\u2019 capacity","present study","protons","differences","compound"],"language":"en"},

In the Cyclades plateau (Aegean Sea), a qualitative and quantitative analysis of macro\u2010benthic fauna was carried out in 1986. Standard multivariate analysis techniques were applied to both ecological (living benthic fauna) and paleoecological data sets in order to distinguish distribution patterns. Results showed that caution must prevail in drawing conclusions from a limited data set. The clearest classification was obtained using total living fauna, while the dead molluscan fauna gave a similar pattern; this indicates similar response to the environmental conditions of the area. In the analysis of the living molluscan fauna, the groups failed to show any clusters, probably as an effect of some impoverished sites. In the two groups delineated, depth seems to be the major factor in the distribution of species. The fact that two distinct data sets (subfossil assemblages and living communities), when treated separately, produce similar grouping indicates that the subfossil assemblages could be reliably used as a first approach for determination of the living communities\u0027 distribution patterns.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zenetos, Argyro; Papathanassiou, Evangelos; Aartsen, Jacobus J.

The versatility of functionalization and high tumour selectivity of the quantum dots make them broadly suitable for tumour-specific imaging and drug delivery.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shuhua; Su, Wen; Wu, Hao; Yuan, Ting; Yuan, Chang; Liu, Jun; Deng, Gang; Gao, Xingchun; Chen, Zeming; Bao, Youmei; Yuan, Fanglong; Zhou, Shixin; Tan, Hongwei; Li, Yunchao; Li, Xiaohong; Fan, Louzhen; Zhu, Jia; Chen, Ann T.; Liu, Fuyao; Zhou, Yu; Li, Miao; Zhai, Xingchen; Zhou, Jiangbing","journal":"Nat Biomed Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/066e9002de1016783544559bb0eefa15ad375f66.json; document_parses/pdf_json/122bda28e87f1106ffe022f942efb678bed2ea20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tumours","tumour-specific imaging","functionalized quantum dots","tumour burden","human tumour xenografts","high tumour selectivity","amino groups","injected carbon quantum dots","large amino acids","photoacoustic imaging","large neutral amino acid transporter","aromatic drugs","drug delivery","\u03C0 stacking interactions","targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics","orthotopic mouse model of human glioma","multiple paired \u03B1-carboxyl","mice","infrared fluorescence","upregulated surface molecules","reduction","cancer cells","versatility of functionalization","absence of detectable toxicity","Strategies"],"language":"en"},

Currently, limited immunomodulator is available to counteract IAV-associated pneumonia in the clinic. Sinensetin, a polymethoxylated flavone with five methoxy groups, has been found to possess anti-agiogenesis, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. However, the effects of sinensetin on IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response remain unclear. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects and corresponding possible mechanism of sinensetin in IAV-infected A549 cells were subjected to investigations. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of sinensetin towards A549 cells was detected by MTT and LDH assays. The antiviral activity of sinensetin against influenza A virus was assayed in A549 cells with an engineered replication-competent influenza A virus carrying Gaussia luciferase reporter gene infection. The effect of sinensetin on influenza A virus-triggered inflammatory reaction was determined by qRT-PCR, Luminex assays, ELISA and Western blot. RESULTS: Our results showed that sinensetin did not exhibit antiviral activity against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Meanwhile, sinensetin treatment significantly decreased IAV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators at mRNA and protein levels, including IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, IP-10, IL-8 and MCP-1. Additionally, levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the downstream product prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) up-regulated by IAV infection were dramatically suppressed by sinensetin. The mechanistic investigation revealed that sinensetin treatment suppressed the NF-\u03BAB transcriptional activity using the NF-\u03BAB reporter stable HEK293 cell line stimulated with TNF-\u03B1 (20 ng/mL) or influenza H1N1 virus. Furthermore, sinensetin abrogated influenza H1N1 virus-induced activation of NF-\u03BAB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results indicated that sinensetin has potential capacity to attenuate IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response via inactivation of NF-\u03BAB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings, which implied that sinensetin may be a promising candidate drug for influenza H1N1 virus infection therapeutics.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jiashun; Jie, Xiang; Liang, Xiaoli; Chen, Ziyu; Xie, Peifang; Pan, Xiping; Zhou, Beixian; Li, Jing","journal":"BMC Complement Med Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a44c40cd6e5f432c3cefa74811dfc3ce27a77f29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","MTT","LDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sinensetin treatment","effect of sinensetin","antiviral activity of sinensetin","cytotoxic effects of sinensetin","IAV infection","sinensetin abrogated influenza H1N1 virus-induced activation of NF","influenza H1N1 virus infection therapeutics","corresponding possible mechanism of sinensetin","IAV-infected A549 cells","IAV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators","robust pro-inflammatory response","NF-\u03BAB transcriptional activity","inflammatory reaction","IAV-associated pneumonia","RESULTS","p38 MAPK signalings","inactivation of NF","engineered replication-competent influenza","anti-inflammatory effects","NF-\u03BAB reporter stable HEK293 cell line","ERK1","TNF-\u03B1","Gaussia luciferase reporter gene infection","Luminex assays","anti-agiogenesis","protein levels","LDH assays","levels of cyclooxygenase","anti-diabetic activities","mRNA","promising candidate drug","ELISA","qRT-PCR","Human respiratory system","severe illness","potential capacity","Western blot","polymethoxylated flavone","MTT","downstream product prostaglandin E","present study","methoxy groups","BACKGROUND","COX","limited immunomodulator","clinic","mechanistic investigation","investigations","METHODS","PGE","death","MCP","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The availability of genomic data is key to understanding viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies. Currently, the use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR-amplified viral sequences (amplicon sequencing), is potentially the most informative approach to monitor viral dissemination and genetic diversity by providing, in a single methodological step, identification and characterization of the whole viral genome at the nucleotide level. Despite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper the reproducibility and comparison of results. Here we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerized and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV short-read sequencing data from both amplicon and shotgun metagenomics approaches. It is able to infer the DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify the serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree. It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement for extensive bioinformatics expertise. Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two types of DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples from patients with variable serotypes and genotypes, including an in vitro spiked sample containing the four known serotypes. The second consisted of 106 paired-end and 76 single-end amplicon sequences of DENV 3 genotype III and DENV 1 genotype I, respectively, where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity.

The Nuss procedure is a new effective treatment for severe flail chest patients who cannot be weaned from prolonged mechanical ventilation in the last few years. However, the procedure is not suitable when there are multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls. Here, we reported a rare case of severe flail chest in a patient who suffered multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls in a traffic accident. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old patient suffered severe flail chest by a steering wheel in a traffic accident with multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls. In the beginning, the patient was administrated with mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for more than 1 week. Then the patient suffered from a severe lung infection and decreased blood oxygen saturation. After a multidiscipline discussion (MDT), three rib fixation plates were first used to rebuild the stability of lateral chest walls, then two Nuss bars were inserted to eliminate paradoxical movement in the anterior chest wall. Finally, the patient recovered smoothly after the combining procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Severe flail chest patients with both the anterior and lateral chest walls after trauma are in a life-threatening situation, and require an appropriate procedure to get out of danger in time. Rib fixation is an effective treatment when the fractured sites are few and the fractured area is small. The Nuss procedure is a new effective method for severe flail chest with multiple fractures in an anterior chest wall, which is also a minimally invasive and short time-consuming procedure. However, it does not suitable for the patient with multiple fractures in lateral chest walls. Combining the use of Nuss procedure and rib fixation can solve severe flail chest with multiple ribs and sternum fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls, and the outcome of this procedure is satisfying in the present rare case.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Quanwei; Zhang, Jinghui; Cai, Kaican; Zhang, Jianhua","journal":"BMC Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a06cef99d8a6ba4a4757f0d707745cf9f482b1ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anterior chest wall","severe flail chest patients","stability of lateral chest walls","rare case of severe flail chest","multiple fractures","combining procedure","appropriate procedure","use of Nuss procedure","multiple ribs","sternum fractures","year-old patient","severe lung infection","short time-consuming procedure","Nuss bars","new effective treatment","rib fixation plates","new effective method","traffic accident","life-threatening situation","present rare case","CASE PRESENTATION","prolonged mechanical ventilation","fractured sites","fractured area","steering wheel","acute respiratory distress syndrome","decreased blood oxygen saturation","trauma","paradoxical movement","ARDS","MDT","CONCLUSIONS","outcome","danger","BACKGROUND","multidiscipline discussion","years","week","beginning"],"language":"en"},

However, retreatment of PTB has often developed resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs. The cure rate (approximately 50.0\u201373.3%) and management of retreatment of PTB in China needs to be improved. Qinbudan decoction has been widely used to treat PTB in China since the 1960s. Previously clinical studies have shown that the Qinbudan tablet (QBDT) promoted sputum-culture negative conversion and lesion absorption. However, powerful evidence from a randomized controlled clinical trial is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of QBDT as an adjunct therapy for retreatment of PTB. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in China. People diagnosed with PTB were enrolled who received previous anti-TB treatment from April 2011 to March 2013. The treatment group received an anti-TB regimen and QBDT, and the control group was administered an anti-TB regimen plus placebo. Anti-TB treatment options included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin for 2 months (2HRZES), followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months (6HRE), daily for 8 months. Primary outcome was sputum-culture conversion using the MGIT 960 liquid medium method. Secondary outcomes included lung lesion absorption and cavity closure. Adverse events and reactions were observed after treatment. A structured questionnaire was used to record demographic information and clinical symptoms of all subjects. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0 software in the full analysis set (FAS) population. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one cases of retreatment PTB were randomly divided into two groups: the placebo group (88 cases) and the QBDT group (93 cases). A total of 166 patients completed the trial and 15 patients lost to follow-up. The culture conversion rate of the QBDT group and placebo group did not show a noticeable improvement by using the covariate sites to correct the rate differences (79.6% vs 69.3%; rate difference = 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.02\u20130.23; F = 2.48, P = 0.12) after treatment. A significant 16.6% increase in lesion absorption was observed in the QBDT group when compared with the placebo group (67.7% vs 51.1%; rate difference = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.02\u20130.31; \u03C7(2) = 5.56, P = 0.02). The intervention and placebo group did not differ in terms of cavity closure (25.5% vs 21.1%; rate difference = 0.04, 95% CI: - 0.21\u20130.12; \u03C7(2) = 0.27, P = 0.60). Two patients who received chemotherapy and combined QBDT reported pruritus/nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: No significant improvement in culture conversion was observed for retreatment PTB with traditional Chinese medicine plus standard anti-TB regimen. However, QBDT as an adjunct therapy significantly promoted lesion absorption, thereby reducing lung injury due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

We examined the projected expectations towards the behaviour of the audiences and the projected ways of information circulation informing public health communication strategies during a pandemic. Participants shared the expectation that the population would react towards an influenza pandemic with panic and fear due to a lack of information or a sensationalist media coverage. They associated the information uptake of their target audience with trust in their expertise. While our informants from public health conceptualised trust in terms of a face-to-face interaction, they sought to gain trust through transparency in their respective institutional settings.

Their ability to predict influenza-related pneumonia, however, is less well-established. METHODS: A total of 693 laboratory-confirmed FluA-p patients diagnosed between Jan 2013 and Dec 2018 and recruited from five teaching hospitals in China were included in the study. The sample included 494 patients in the derivation cohort and 199 patients in the validation cohort. The prediction rule was established based on independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients from the derivation cohort. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of FluA-p patients was 19.6% (136/693). The FluA-p score was based on a multivariate logistic regression model designed to predict mortality. Results indicated the following significant predictors (regression statistics and point contributions toward total score in parentheses): blood urea nitrogen \u003E 7 mmol/L (OR 1.604, 95% CI 1.150\u20134.492, p = 0.040; 1 points), pO(2)/F(i)O(2) \u2264 250 mmHg (OR 2.649, 95% CI 1.103\u20135.142, p = 0.022; 2 points), cardiovascular disease (OR 3.967, 95% CI 1.269\u20137.322, p \u003C 0.001; 3 points), arterial PH \u003C 7.35 (OR 3.959, 95% CI 1.393\u20137.332, p \u003C 0.001; 3 points), smoking history (OR 5.176, 95% CI 2.604\u201311.838, p = 0.001; 4 points), lymphocytes \u003C 0.8 \u00D7 10(9)/L (OR 8.391, 95% CI 3.271\u201316.212, p \u003C 0.001; 5 points), and early neurominidase inhibitor therapy (OR 0.567, 95% CI 0.202\u20130.833, p = 0.005; \u2212 2 points). Seven points was used as the cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. The model showed a sensitivity of 0.941, a specificity of 0.762, and overall better predictive performance than the PSI risk class (AUROC = 0.908 vs 0.560, p \u003C 0.001) and the CURB-65 score (AUROC = 0.908 vs 0.777, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that a FluA-p score was easy to derive and that it served as a reliable prediction rule for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients. The score could also effectively stratify FluA-p patients into relevant risk categories and thereby help treatment providers to make more rational clinical decisions.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Liang; Han, Xiudi; Li, Yan Li; Zhang, Chunxiao; Xing, Xiqian","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5118efb1f547ec7051e34bedb6b428380bd91c15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206684/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["FluA-p patients","FluA-p score","points","day mortality of FluA","total score","mortality risk stratification","RESULTS","derivation cohort","PSI risk class","relevant risk categories","independent risk factors","AUROC","CURB","vs","validation cohort","blood urea nitrogen","pneumonia severity index","reliable prediction rule","influenza-related pneumonia","blood pressure","regression statistics","multivariate logistic regression model","treatment providers","respiratory rate","age","contributions","parentheses","following significant predictors","better predictive performance","cut-off value","laboratory","early neurominidase inhibitor therapy","confusion","years","rational clinical decisions","China","ability","BACKGROUND","mmol","cardiovascular disease","smoking history","teaching hospitals","specificity","sensitivity","METHODS","mmHg","arterial PH","sample","community","study","CONCLUSIONS","lymphocytes"],"language":"en"},

We consider two types of patches including high-risk and low-risk ones under the assumption that a local patch is changed from a high-risk one to a low-risk one by an intervention. We theoretically analyze the intervention threshold which indicates the critical fraction of low-risk patches for preventing a global epidemic outbreak. We show that an intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective for epidemic control than a random intervention. The theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations for synthetic and realistic scale-free patch networks. The theoretical results also reveal that the intervention threshold depends on the human mobility network and the mobility rate.

In this paper, we show that a multiplex structure can greatly affect the spread of an epidemic driven by traffic dynamics. One of the interesting findings is that the multiplex structure could suppress the outbreak of an epidemic, which is different from the typical finding of spread dynamics in multiplex networks. In particular, one layer with dense connections can attract more traffic flow and eventually suppress the epidemic outbreak in other layers. Therefore, the epidemic threshold will be larger than the minimal threshold of the layers. With a mean-field approximation, we provide explicit expressions for the epidemic threshold and for the onset of suppressing epidemic spreading in multiplex networks. We also provide the probability of obtaining a multiplex configuration that suppresses the epidemic spreading when the multiplex is composed of: (i) two Erd\u0151s-R\u00E9nyi layers and (ii) two scale-free layers. Therefore, compared to the situation of an isolated network in which a disease may be able to propagate, a larger epidemic threshold can be found in multiplex structures.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jie; Hu, Mao-Bin; Li, Ming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/017962af54f047e5465419945f4d21515c2c6737.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217497.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217497/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiplex networks","epidemic outbreak","epidemic spreading","larger epidemic threshold","multiplex configuration","multiplex structures","multiple layers","minimal threshold","scale-free layers","Erd\u0151s-R\u00E9nyi layers","traffic dynamics","typical finding of spread dynamics","network system","traffic flow","isolated network","diverse interaction","dense connections","powerful way","explicit expressions","onset","mean-field approximation","disease","interesting findings","Recent progress","situation","probability","paper"],"language":"en"},

The interplay between strong and weak ties plays an important role on dynamical processes that could unfold on complex systems. However, seldom do we have access to precise information about the time-varying topology of interaction patterns. A particularly elusive question is to distinguish strong from weak ties, on the basis of the sole node dynamics. Building upon analytical results, we propose a statistically-principled algorithm to reconstruct the backbone of strong ties from data of a spreading process, consisting of the time series of individuals\u0027 states. Our method is numerically validated over a range of synthetic datasets, encapsulating salient features of real-world systems. Motivated by compelling evidence, we propose the integration of our algorithm in a targeted immunization strategy that prioritizes influential nodes in the inferred backbone.

However, the tolerance of human genomes to losing enhancers has not yet been evaluated. Here we present the catalog of LoF-tolerant enhancers using structural variants from whole-genome sequences. Using a conservative approach, we estimate that individual human genomes possess at least 28 LoF-tolerant enhancers on average. We assessed the properties of LoF-tolerant enhancers in a unified regulatory network constructed by integrating tissue-specific enhancers and gene-gene interactions. We find that LoF-tolerant enhancers tend to be more tissue-specific and regulate fewer and more dispensable genes relative to other enhancers. They are enriched in immune-related cells while enhancers with low LoF-tolerance are enriched in kidney and brain/neuronal stem cells. We developed a supervised learning approach to predict the LoF-tolerance of all enhancers, which achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 98%. We predict 3,519 more enhancers would be likely tolerant to LoF and 129 enhancers that would have low LoF-tolerance. Our predictions are supported by a known set of disease enhancers and novel deletions from PacBio sequencing. The LoF-tolerance scores provided here will serve as an important reference for disease studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Duo; Gokcumen, Omer; Khurana, Ekta","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e0549767240cdb20a8d44b39c51a8f828af0d51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159235.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LoF-tolerant enhancers","catalog of LoF","properties of LoF","low LoF-tolerance","LoF-tolerance scores","tissue-specific enhancers","LoF-tolerant protein-coding genes","known set of disease enhancers","tolerance of human genomes","disease studies","gene-gene interactions","individual human genomes","structural variants","Previous studies","conservative approach","neuronal stem cells","dispensable genes relative","immune-related cells","supervised learning approach","novel deletions","kidney","unified regulatory network","fewer","brain","PacBio sequencing","potential impact of loss","receiver","characteristics curve","area","function","AUROC","genome sequences","important reference","average","predictions"],"language":"en"},

They efficiently label Hepatitis C Virus pseudotyped particles (HCVpp), more stably and reproducibly than commercial probes, and a strong fluorescence signal is observed with a high contrast.

Finally, it is shown by fluorescence microscopy that these probes enable efficient tracking of labeled HCVpp inside hepatocarcinoma cells used as model hepatocytes, in spite of their autofluorescence up to 700 nm.

This activity is due to several preexisting naturally occurring molecules that are either active against individual members or a family of viruses.

Therefore, their possible role against viraemia remains unknown. Recently, two naturally occurring nonspecific broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents, University of Texas Inhibitor \u03B2 (UTI\u03B2) glycoprotein and high density lipoprotein, have been described in human serum. They are active against DNA and RNA viruses and one of them, UTI\u03B2, possesses significant antiviral activity of 40 units/mL. Since preexisting antiviral molecules in serum appear to be the only defence mechanisms available at the onset of viral infection they may have protective significance against viraemia. In view of this potential, we have undertaken to review the properties of these innate viral inhibitory molecules.

The present study was performed in order to clarify a) the cause of the wasting syndrome and b) the protective role of antigen\u2010specific milk antibodies. METHOD: Ig\u2010deficient mouse embryos in a conventional environment were embryo\u2010transferred to specified pathogen free (SPF) dams. Neonatal growth, mortality, and health status of mice from both environments was recorded. Suspected presence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was tested by RT\u2010PCR. Protective effects on neonatal mortality of milk containing different titers of anti\u2010MHV antibodies were investigated in cross\u2010fostering experiments. RESULTS: The SPF colony of Ig\u2010deficient mice exhibited no breeding problems, whereas Ig\u2010deficient neonates in the conventional environment suffered from lethal wasting syndrome. Serological screening of the mice kept in the two environments revealed that mice in the conventional room had high titers of antibodies against mouse hepatitis virus. Presence of MHV in runting neonates was confirmed by pathological examinations and RT\u2010nested\u2010PCR using MHV genome specific primers. Milk containing high titers of anti\u2010MHV antibodies, when provided for 8 days or more, completely prevented Ig\u2010deficient neonates from developing wasting syndrome in the conventional environment. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the neonatal wasting syndrome is associated with the presence of MHV and that neonates are efficiently protected by MHV\u2010specific antibodies in the milk.","publish_time":"2011-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gustafsson, Erika; Blomqvist, Gunilla; Bellman, Anna; Holmdahl, Rikard; Mattsson, Anita; Mattsson, Ragnar","journal":"Am J Reprod Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8babcce9632338ee2a55844d88e02d015750cc3d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Presence of MHV","deficient mice","Neonatal mice","specific milk antibodies","specific antibodies","deficient neonates","conventional environment","neonatal wasting syndrome","high titers of anti\u2010MHV antibodies","different titers of anti\u2010MHV antibodies","high titers of antibodies","neonatal mortality of milk","lethal wasting syndrome","conventional room","MHV genome specific primers","conventional conditions","runting neonates","deficient mouse embryos","Neonatal growth","health status of mice","SPF colony of Ig","Suspected presence of mouse hepatitis virus","dams","PCR","lethal runting","environments","Protective effects","protective role of antigen","breeding problems","pathological examinations","pathogen free","cause","immunoglobulins","METHOD","findings","cross","order","Igs","RESULTS","present study","Serological screening","days","CONCLUSION","experiments"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A genome\u2010wide linkage analysis of an (E3 \u00D7 DA)DA backcross of rats with CIA (n = 364 male rats; the same strain combinations as previously used to determine the genetic control of PIA) was performed. The strongest loci in both CIA and PIA (i.e., Cia12/Pia4 and Cia13/Pia7) were isolated in congenic strains. Susceptibility in both congenic strains was tested in rats with CIA and in rats with PIA. RESULTS: We found a striking, although not complete, similarity of the arthritis\u2010controlling loci in CIA and in PIA, as well as the previously defined loci associated with cartilage destruction, antibody production, and the acute\u2010phase response. All major PIA quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified in early severe arthritis were also strong regulators of CIA. The 2 strongest QTLs, Cia12/Pia4 on chromosome 12 and Cia13/Pia7 on chromosome 4, were also analyzed in congenic strains with DA or E3 as the background genome. Consistent with the results of linkage analysis, the congenic strain experiments showed that the chromosome 4 locus was more penetrant in CIA than in PIA, while the chromosome 12 locus almost completely dominated the control of PIA severity. CONCLUSION: The underlying genetic control of CIA was found to have many, but not all, pathogenic mechanisms in common with PIA, despite the use of a cartilage\u2010specific antigen (type II collagen) to induce CIA but not PIA.","publish_time":"2003-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olofsson, Peter; Lu, Shemin; Holmberg, Jens; Song, Tusheng; Wernhoff, Patrik; Pettersson, Ulf; Holmdahl, Rikard","journal":"Arthritis Rheum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e938760fd4351ffa3d99097b680e766261d572e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic control of PIA","control of PIA severity","chromosome","underlying genetic control of CIA","congenic strains","major PIA quantitative trait loci","DA backcross of rats","induced arthritis","strongest loci","male rats","defined loci","congenic strain experiments","E3","strongest QTLs","early severe arthritis","results of linkage analysis","Pia4","Cia12","genetic regulation of collagen","Pia7","Cia13","locus","wide linkage analysis","cartilage destruction","strain combinations","background genome","strong regulators of","antibody production","specific antigen","use","type","similarity","pristane","METHODS","pathogenic mechanisms","CONCLUSION","phase response","OBJECTIVE","Susceptibility"],"language":"en"},

Previously, the 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-7) was marketed in Russia in 2009 but has never been offered for mass vaccination. A carriage study was performed among children in Arkhangelsk in 2006. The objective was to determine the prevalence of carriage, serotype distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and the molecular structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains before marketing and introduction of PCV-13. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a cluster-randomized sample of children and a self-administrated questionnaire for parents/guardians. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 438 children younger than 7 years attending nurseries and kindergartens in the Arkhangelsk region, Russia. Detailed demographic data, as well as information about the child\u2019s health, traveling, exposure to antimicrobials within the last 3 months and anthropometric measurements were collected for all study subjects. Variables extracted from the questionnaire were analysed using statistic regression models to estimate the risk of carriage. All pneumococcal isolates were examined with susceptibility testing, serotyping and multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of asymptomatic carriage was high and peaking at 36 months with a rate of 57%. PCV-13 covered 67.3% of the detected strains. High rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin, macrolides and multidrug resistance were associated with specific vaccine serotypes, pandemic clones, and local sequence types. Nine percent of isolates represented three globally disseminated disease-associated pandemic clones; penicillin- and macrolide-resistant clones Norway(NT)-42 and Poland(6B)-20, as well as penicillin- and macrolide-susceptible clone Netherlands(3)-31. A high level of antimicrobial consumption was noted by the study. According to the parent\u2019s reports, 89.5% of the children used at least one antimicrobial regime since birth. None of the hypothesised predictors of S. pneumoniae carriage were statistically significant in univariable and multivariable logistic models. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a high coverage of the PCV-13-vaccine, but serotype replacement and expansion of globally disseminated disease-associated clones with non-vaccine serotypes may be expected. Further surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution is therefore required.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vorobieva S.

While host and viral proteins play important roles in viral decision\u2010making, the extent to which viral RNA (vRNA) actively participates in translation and replication might be surprising. Here, the focus is on flaviviruses, which include common human scourges such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses, from an RNA\u2010centric viewpoint. In reviewing more recent findings, an attempt is made to fill knowledge gaps and revisit some canonical views of vRNA structures involved in replication. In particular, alternative views are offered on the nature of the flaviviral promoter and genome cyclization, and the feasibility of refining in vitro\u2010derived models with modern RNA probing and sequencing methods is pointed out. By tracing vRNA structures from translation through encapsidation, a dynamic molecule closely involved in the self\u2010regulation of viral replication is revealed.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hodge, Kenneth; Kamkaew, Maliwan; Pisitkun, Trairak; Chimnaronk, Sarin","journal":"Bioessays","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161798.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","translation","viral proteins","viral decision\u2010making","modern RNA","self\u2010regulation of viral replication","canonical views of vRNA structures","tracing vRNA structures","alternative views","Zika viruses","important roles","dengue","encapsidation","extent","West Nile","derived models","genome cyclization","common human scourges","feasibility of refining","nature","dynamic molecule","attempt","flaviviruses","flaviviral promoter","knowledge gaps","host","holder of genetic information","template","sequencing methods","centric viewpoint","recent findings","focus"],"language":"en"},

CD66a, CD66b, CD66c and CD66d mAb binding to neutrophils triggers an activation signal that regulates the adhesive activity of CD11/CD18, resulting in an increase in neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Molecular modeling of CEACAM1 using IgG and CD4 as models has been performed, and three peptides from the N\u2010terminal domain were found to increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. The peptides were 14 amino acids in length and were predicted to be present at loops and turns between \u03B2\u2010sheets. To better understand the amino acid sequences critical for this biological activity, in the present study we examined the other neutrophil CEACAMs and the highly homologous CEACAM, CEA. Molecular modeling of the N\u2010terminal domains of human CEACAM8, \u20106, \u20103 and CEA was performed. Twenty peptides, each 14 amino acids in length, that were homologous to the previously reported peptides from the N\u2010domains of CEACAM1, were synthesized and tested for their ability to alter neutrophil adhesion. Only one new peptide, from the N\u2010domain of CEA, was found to increase neutrophil adhesion, and this peptide differed from the corresponding CEACAM1 peptide by only a single conservative amino acid substitution. Importantly, minor amino acid differences between active and inactive homologous peptides suggest regions of these peptides that are critical for biological activity. The data suggest that the regions SMPF of peptide CD66a\u20101, QLFG of peptide CD66a\u20102 and NRQIV of peptide CD66a\u20103 are critical for the activities of these peptides, and for the native CEACAMs.","publish_time":"2008-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skubitz, K.M.; Campbell, K.D.; Skubitz, A.

WNVCp was shown to interfere with the formation of the HDM2 and p53 complex, thereby causing the stabilization of p53 and the subsequent induction of its target apoptotic protein, Bax. Whereas WNVCp was capable of inducing the p53\u2010dependent apoptotic process in wild\u2010type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) or SH\u2010SY5Y cells, it exerted no significant effects on p53\u2010null MEF or on p53\u2010knockdown SH\u2010SY5Y cells. This suggests that WNVCp\u2010mediated apoptosis requires p53. Furthermore, when WNV was transfected into cells, endogenous Hdm2 and WNVCp were able to interact physically. WNVCp expressed in wild\u2010type MEF proved able to induce the translocation of the endogenous Hdm2 into the nucleolus. Consistently, WNV was highly pathogenic in the presence of p53, and was less so in the absence of p53.

Owing to the different incidences in males and females, this study aims to analyze the features involved in the transmission of shigellosis among male (subscript m) and female (subscript f) individuals using a newly developed sex-based model. METHODS: The data of reported shigellosis cases were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. A sex-based Susceptible\u2013Exposed\u2013Infectious/Asymptomatic\u2013Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to explore the dataset, and a sex-age-based SEIAR model was applied in 2010 to explore the sex- and age-specific transmissions. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 130 770 shigellosis cases (including 73 981 male and 56 789 female cases) were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model exhibited a significant fitting effect with the shigellosis data (P \u003C 0.001). The median values of the shigellosis transmission were 2.3225 \u00D7 10(8) for SAR(mm) (secondary attack rate from male to male), 2.5729 \u00D7 10(8) for SAR(mf), 2.7630 \u00D7 10(-8) for SAR(fm), and 2.1061 \u00D7 10(-8) for SAR(ff). The top five mean values of the transmission relative rate in 2010 (where the subscript 1 was defined as male and age \u2264 5 years, 2 was male and age 6 to 59 years, 3 was male and age \u2265 60 years, 4 was female and age \u2264 5 years, 5 was female and age 6 to 59 years, and 6 was male and age \u2265 60 years) were 5.76 \u00D7 10(-8) for \u03B2(61), 5.32 \u00D7 10(-8) for \u03B2(31), 4.01 \u00D7 10(-8) for \u03B2(34), 7.52 \u00D7 10(-9) for \u03B2(62), and 6.04 \u00D7 10(-9) for \u03B2(64). CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of shigellosis differed among male and female individuals.

It is an approach to manage uncertain risks and to prevent any damage to the environment or human. A key element is to take action, even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. Although there are also critics of this principle, it is meanwhile, also increasingly implemented in medicine. An important subject is medicinal products of human or animal origin. Manifold official precaution\u2010guided regulations have been stated to improve their safety, particularly to avoid any infection by viruses and pathogens causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In addition to numerous regulations and decisions, it is generally recommended to substitute animal and human\u2010derived products with adequate alternatives wherever possible. This is a great challenge for research and drug development. One option is recombinant proteins, which however, are not generally free of any risk of contamination. Therefore, the best strategy might be the development of synthetic, specifically acting drugs. The most widely used medicinal product of animal origin at present is heparin. Although there has been no indication of any viral contamination, many other reasons suggest its substitution by alternative antithrombotics. These actually promoted the research on new anticoagulants. With the approval of fondaparinux, the first synthetic, selective factor Xa, a first alternative to the porcine\u2010derived heparin has become available. In addition, other synthetic antithrombotics are currently in clinical development. In principle, it is thus possible that the prophylaxis and therapy of thromboembolic diseases will become completely independent of animal\u2010derived drugs, which would be in line with the precautionary principle.","publish_time":"2005-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alban, S.","journal":"Eur J Clin Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d177355455a46e157070243714e5faba8419db86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of synthetic","precautionary principle","derived products","independent of animal","synthetic antithrombotics","derived heparin","derived drugs","medicinal products of human","medicinal product of animal origin","drug development","alternative antithrombotics","clinical development","research","addition","acting drugs","guided regulations","numerous regulations","viral contamination","risk of contamination","viruses","pathogens","reasons","present","adequate alternatives","transmissible spongiform encephalopathies","therapy of thromboembolic diseases","selective factor Xa","infection","prophylaxis","damage","great challenge","important subject","action","cause","uncertain risks","official precaution","decisions","substitution","health","importance","line","approval of fondaparinux","best strategy","option","recombinant proteins","key element","effect relationships","approach","new anticoagulants","indication","environment","decade","safety","critics","medicine"],"language":"en"},

Thirty three patients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe COPD were seen at baseline, when the number of chest infections in the previous year was noted, and acutely at COPD exacerbation. Within 48 h after the onset of the exacerbation and at baseline, nasal aspirates and induced sputum were taken for rhinovirus reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) analysis and determination of cytokine levels. Symptoms, recorded on diary cards, were noted and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) measured. At exacerbation, mean FEV1 and FVC fell significantly from baseline (p\u003C0.001). Ten of 43 exacerbations were associated with rhinovirus infection, detected in induced sputum. In four of these, nasophageal samples contained no detectable rhinovirus. All baseline samples were negative for rhinovirus. The simultaneous presence of increased nasal discharge/nasal congestion (in 26 of the 43 exacerbations) and increased sputum (29 exacerbations) was strongly associated with the presence of rhinovirus (odds ratio 6.15; p=0.036).

The objective of this study was to classify the invasiveness of alien species that have invaded the Upper Burdekin Catchment in Queensland, Australia, at three spatial scales. A combination of three published weed classification frameworks and multivariate techniques were employed to classify species based on their frequency and cover at a range of spatial scales. We surveyed the Upper Burdekin Catchment for alien species, and for each species determined the following distribution indices \u2014 site frequency, total cover, transect frequency per site frequency and quadrat frequency per site frequency, cover per quadrat when present, cover per transect when present, and cover per site when present. These indices capture the effect of species abundance and frequency between sites (site frequency and total cover), within sites (transect frequency per site and cover per transect when present), and within transects (quadrat frequency per site frequency and cover per site). They were used to classify the species into seven groups using a hierarchical cluster analysis. The relationship between the indices was explored to determine how effective the small scale, site\u2010specific indices were at predicting the broader, landscape\u2010scale patterns. Strong correlations were observed between transect frequency per site and frequency (r (2) = 0.89) and cover per transect when present and total cover (r (2) = 0.62). This suggests that if a weed is abundant at the site level, it has the potential to occupy large areas of the catchment. The species groupings derived from the application of the three published weed classification frameworks were compared graphically to the groupings derived from the cluster analysis. One of the frameworks classified species into three groups. The other two frameworks classified species into four groups. There was a high degree of subjectivity in applying the frameworks to the survey data. Some of the data were of no relevance to the classification frameworks and were therefore ignored. We suggest that the weed classification frameworks should be used in conjunction with existing multivariate techniques to ensure that classifications capture important natural variations in observed data that may reflect invasion processes. The combined use of the frameworks and multivariate techniques enabled us to aggregate species into categories appropriate for management.","publish_time":"2006-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawes, Roger A.; Murphy, Helen T.; Grice, Anthony C.","journal":"Divers Distrib","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63f3dbec0f5c2d13e98dcbca95824db0fcbf5c73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["site frequency","quadrat frequency","species present","total cover","species groupings","site level","published weed classification frameworks","effect of species abundance","invasiveness of alien species","catchment scale","weed management","groups","Upper Burdekin Catchment","site\u2010specific indices","observed data","existing multivariate techniques","sites","following distribution indices","small scale","scale patterns","survey data","range of spatial scales","hierarchical cluster analysis","classifications","Australia","important natural variations","Queensland","conjunction","application","information","potential","combination","combined use","landscape","large areas","invasion processes","categories appropriate","relevance","high degree of subjectivity","study","Strong correlations","objective","impact","relationship"],"language":"en"},

However, DNA:DNA hybridization with R. radiobacter, R. rubi, R. vitis and R. huautlense gave only 44%, 5%, 8% and 8% similarity respectively, suggesting that IRBG74 is potentially a new species. Additionally, it contained no vir genes and lacked tumour\u2010forming ability, but harboured a sym\u2010plasmid containing nifH and nodA genes similar to those in other Sesbania symbionts. Indeed, IRBG74 effectively nodulated S. cannabina and seven other Sesbania spp. that nodulate with Ensifer (Sinorhizobium)/Rhizobium strains with similar nodA genes to IRBG74, but not species that nodulate with Azorhizobium or Mesorhizobium.

Thus, IRBG74 is the first confirmed legume\u2010nodulating symbiont from the Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) clade. Cross\u2010inoculation studies with various Sesbania symbionts showed that S. cannabina could form fully effective symbioses with strains in the genera Rhizobium and Ensifer, only ineffective ones with Azorhizobium strains, and either partially effective (Mesorhizobium huakii) or ineffective (Mesorhizobium plurifarium) symbioses with Mesorhizobium.

Therefore, mechanisms of anti\u2010Id vaccination appear to go beyond structural mimicry of Ag, but remain undefined. Using the neurotropic murine coronavirus animal model, we have previously shown that a polyclonal noninternal image anti\u2010Id (Ab2) could vaccinate BALB/c mice. To characterize its mode of action, we have examined the immune modulating capability of this Ab2 in vivo in strains of mice with different H\u20102 haplotypes. Even though only internal image anti\u2010Id are expected to induce non\u2010genetically restricted immunity, this noninternal image Ab2 induced protective immunity in four of eight genetically different strains of mice susceptible to coronavirus infection. These were BALB/c (H\u20102(d)), DBA/1 (H\u20102(d)), DBA/1 (H\u20102(q)), and SWR (H\u20102(q)) mice. Protection was generally correlated with the induction of specific antiviral Ab (Ab3) that showed biological properties, such as virus neutralization in vitro, similar to the initial Ab1. To evaluate the genetic implication of the H\u20102 haplotypes in protection, congenic mice were also tested. Vaccination profiles suggest that cooperation between background gene(s) of the BALB/c mouse with H\u20102(d) and H\u20102(q) loci is necessary for an optimal protective immune response, although the main genetic element(s) regulating the antiviral response to Ab2 inoculation appeared to be located outside the major histocompatibility complex.

This process, called leadzyme interference, is determined by specific recognition and cleavage of the target site by the RNA catalytic strand in the presence of Pb(2\u002B).","publish_time":"2006-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wyszko, Eliza; Nowak, Monika; Pospieszny, Henryk; Szymanski, Maciej; Pas, Jakub; Barciszewska, Miros\u0142awa Z.; Barciszewski, Jan","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c73ff4451cfd405186cb798e78527ff205a1fb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163940/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tobacco mosaic virus accumulation","genomic tobacco mosaic virus RNA","specific tobacco mosaic virus RNA cleavage","tobacco plants","inhibiting tobacco mosaic virus infection","inhibition of tobacco mosaic virus infection","infected tobacco leaves","specific leadzyme motif","mer RNA","leadzyme interference","specific RNA hydrolysis","RNA catalytic strand","specific recognition","leadzyme substrate target sequence","inoculation of leaves","nucleotide catalytic loop","target site","mer oligoribonucleotide capable","new method","significant reduction","presence of Pb","process"],"language":"en"},

Cloning of the cDNA of this enzyme and biochemical studies revealed that the large extracellular domain of the enzyme with the catalytically active site contains nine cysteine residues that are highly conserved among species. To investigate the functional role of these cysteines in TRH\u2010DE we used a site\u2010directed mutagenesis approach and replaced individually each cysteine by a serine residue. The results revealed that the proteolytically truncated and enzymatically fully active enzyme consists of two identical subunits that are associated noncovalently by protein\u2013protein interactions but not via interchain S\u2010S bridges. The eight cysteines contained within this region are all important for the structure of the individual subunit and the enzymatic activity, which is dramatically reduced in all mutant enzymes. This is even true for the four cysteines that are clustered within the C\u2010terminal domain remote from the Zn\u2010binding consensus sequence HEICH. In contrast, Cys68, which resides within the stalk region seven residues from the end of the hydrophobic membrane\u2010spanning domain, can be replaced by serine without a significant change in the enzymatic activity. Interestingly, this residue is involved in the formation of an interchain disulfide bridge. Covalent dimerization of the subunits, however, does not seem to be essential for efficient biosynthesis, enzymatic activity and trafficking to the cell surface.","publish_time":"2001-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papadopoulos, Theofilos; Heuer, Heike; Bauer, Karl","journal":"Eur J Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0025e918280c812752e109121c121b7ca7bc7eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enzymatic activity","cysteines","active enzyme","cysteine residues","interchain S","TRH","active site","hormone","serine residue","terminal domain remote","large extracellular domain","S bridges","protein interactions","stalk region","degradation of thyrotropin","identical subunits","M1 family of Zn","interchain disulfide bridge","trafficking","dependent aminopeptidases","biochemical studies","member","efficient biosynthesis","binding consensus sequence HEICH","individual subunit","structure","cDNA","formation","Glp","ectoenzyme","significant change","hydrophobic membrane","cell surface","mutagenesis approach","functional role","Pro\u2010NH","Cys68","results","Covalent dimerization","species","Cloning","mutant enzymes","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Aquatic bryophytes were sampled from 108 streams spanning over 3000 m of altitude in four regions of Nepal. Richness, cover and community composition were related to physicochemistry using multiple regression, DECORANA ordination and TWINSPAN. The performance of a hierarchically scaled descriptive model, developed in New Zealand for predicting bryophyte distribution, was examined in this highly heterogeneous Himalayan region. 2. Community composition and cover varied highly significantly with altitude, streambed stability and alkalinity, with evidence of effects of riparian land use on bryophyte cover. Cover was greatest in streams at low to middle altitudes with steep slopes (\u003E 15\u00B0), high stability and low conductivity (\u003C 60 \u03BCS cm(\u20131)), where communities were dominated by two Isopterygium spp., two Philonotis spp., Mnium punctatum and Lejeuneaceae. 3. Richness, by contrast, increased significantly but weakly at high altitude and moderate stability, where streams were dominated by Eurynchium praelongum, Rhynchostegium spp., Fissidens grandifrons and Hygroamblystegium spp. Richness and cover were lowest in unstable streams at the lowest altitude, where no single taxon was consistently most abundant. 4. Although these results were similar to those in the descriptive model developed for bryophytes in New Zealand, subtle differences were apparent. Substrate size, although influencing the presence of bryophytes in New Zealand streams, appeared to be unimportant in Nepal. By contrast, streambed stability was more important in Nepal than New Zealand, perhaps reflecting pronounced monsoonal floods, and subsequent increased frequency of bed movement in the former. A suggested habitat template indicates that large plant size and vegetative reproduction may be responsible for the widespread distribution of some species, even into unstable Himalayan streams.","publish_time":"2002-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suren, A.

IFN induction by coronavirus is shown to involve interaction between a viral glycoprotein and a leukocyte subset, likely equivalent to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, present in the mucosae and associated lymphoid tissues. Given the IFN mediated antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, the use of IFN or IFN inducers may prove an efficient strategy for a better control of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in pigs. Because influenza and coronaviruses target mucosal surfaces, adaptative immune responses have to be characterized at mucosal sites. Thus, nasal and pulmonary antibody responses were analyzed in influenza virus infected or vaccinated pigs showing short\u2010lived, but potentially protective local IgA and IgG antibody (Ab) responses. Interestingly, primary influenza virus infection induced long\u2010lived increase of lung CD8(\u002B) T cells and local lymphoproliferative responses. Pigs infected by a respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) showed virus\u2010specific IgG Ab\u2010secreting cells in the bronchial lymph nodes, whereas the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) induced more IgA Ab\u2010secreting cells in gut tissues, which illustrates the importance of the route of antigen administration for inducing local immune effector mechanisms. Porcine viral infections provide, therefore, valuable models for evaluating the immune parameters that are important for controlling transmission of important viral zoonotic infections.","publish_time":"2006-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHARLEY, BERNARD; RIFFAULT, SABINE; VAN REETH, KRISTIEN","journal":"Ann N Y Acad Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56e6015bd071ab74866892f3a064c871a9e62013.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168046.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus infected pigs","better control of influenza virus","lung secretions of influenza virus infected pigs","adaptative immune responses of pigs","primary influenza virus infection","coronavirus infections","production of infectious virus","influenza virus infection of human populations","vaccinated pigs","IFN production","respiratory coronavirus","use of IFN","IFN inducers","IFN induction","local lymphoproliferative responses","secreting cells","immune parameters","pulmonary antibody responses","coronaviruses","transmission of important viral zoonotic infections","Porcine viral infections","T cells","IgA Ab","local immune effector mechanisms","mucosal sites","important animal reservoir","transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","control of infectious diseases","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","specific IgG Ab","protective local IgA","IgG antibody","viral glycoprotein","mucosal surfaces","important group of viruses","spreading of zoonotic diseases","animal reservoirs","gut tissues","early type","lymphoid tissues","clinical protection","Pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines","intensity of clinical signs","long\u2010lived increase of lung CD8","severe acute respiratory syndrome","leukocyte subset","bronchial lymph nodes","TNF","tumor necrosis factor","interferon","route of antigen administration","efficient strategy","importance","mucosae","SARS","prior vaccination","immunomodulatory effects","TGEV","PRCV","valuable models","humans","lungs","interleukin","challenge","interaction","Studies","natural hosts","IL","article"],"language":"en"},

A lumbar puncture can be helpful in diagnosing MS when CSF immunoglobulins and oligoclonal bands are present. White matter demyelinating lesions on MRI are required for the diagnosis; however, children typically have fewer lesions than adults. Many criteria have been proposed to diagnose MS that have been applied to children, mostly above 10 years of age. The recent revisions to the McDonald criteria allow for earlier diagnosis, such as after a clinically isolated event. However, children are more likely than adults to have monosymptomatic illnesses.

Using mathematical modeling, we simulated the number of new incident and prevalent cases of SARS after one infected person was admitted to a hospital (index case). The simulation was tested stochastically using the SEIR model based on previously reported Gamma distributions. We estimated the duration time until 10 beds in negative pressure rooms in Chiyoda\u2010ku, one of the 23 wards in Tokyo, were fully occupied with SARS\u2010infected patients. We determined the impact of an increasing number of days on the number of prevalent cases until the index case was isolated. The prevalent cases increase exponentially along with the increase of the non\u2010isolation period of the index case, and all the beds were fully occupied if the index case was not isolated until more than 6 days. However even 2 days non\u2010isolation period of the index case could fill up all the beds when 16% of secondary infections are transmitted outside the hospital. There is a possibility that an epidemic will occur with the isolation of the index case even at early days if the infection is transmitted outside the hospital. The simulation results revealed that it was important to recognize and isolate SARS patients as early as possible and also to prevent the transmission spreading outside the hospital to control an epidemic.","publish_time":"2013-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukutome, Ayako; Watashi, Koichi; Kawakami, Norito; Ishikawa, Hirofumi","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09388216c17c4cc48b1f166093318753cc68ac63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["index case","prevalent cases of SARS","number of prevalent cases","beds","early days","days non\u2010isolation period","increasing number of days","cumulative cases","isolate SARS patients","infected patients","increase","epidemic","number of new incident","infected person","nosocomial transmission","simulation results","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","negative pressure rooms","ku","Chiyoda","SEIR model","reported Gamma distributions","duration time","Hong Kong","secondary infections","impact","wards","hospitals","mathematical modeling","Tokyo","deaths","possibility"],"language":"en"},

Sporadic outbreaks associated with human\u2010to\u2010human transmission caused hundreds of human fatalities. Here, we collected all available NiV sequences and combined phylogenetics, molecular selection, structural biology and receptor analysis to study the emergence and adaptive evolution of NiV. NiV can be divided into two main lineages including the Bangladesh and Malaysia lineages. We formly confirmed a significant association with geography which is probably the result of long\u2010term evolution of NiV in local bat population. The two NiV lineages differ in many amino acids; one change in the fusion protein might be involved in its activation via binding to the G protein. We also identified adaptive and positively selected sites in many viral proteins. In the receptor\u2010binding G protein, we found that sites 384, 386 and especially 498 of G protein might modulate receptor\u2010binding affinity and thus contribute to the host jump from bats to humans via the adaption to bind the human ephrin\u2010B2 receptor. We also found that site 1645 in the connector domain of L was positive selected and involved in adaptive evolution; this site might add methyl groups to the cap structure present at the 5\u2032\u2010end of the RNA and thus modulate its activity. This study provides insight to assist the design of early detection methods for NiV to assess its epidemic potential in humans.","publish_time":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Kemang; Yan, Shiyu; Wang, Ningning; He, Wanting; Guan, Haifei; He, Chengxi; Wang, Zhixue; Lu, Meng; He, Wei; Ye, Rui; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa8e48f1afd82bbfd319e3847721a6f5a6a4f16e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["NiV lineages","adaptive evolution of NiV","binding G protein","available NiV sequences","result of long\u2010term evolution of NiV","humans","human transmission","receptor analysis","human ephrin","B2 receptor","Malaysia lineages","fusion protein","hundreds of human fatalities","selected sites","main lineages","emergence","binding affinity","study","molecular selection","combined phylogenetics","structural biology","methyl groups","design of early detection methods","great threat","local bat population","cap structure present","amino acids","bats","domestic animals","change","connector domain","adaption","Bangladesh","activation","host jump","Nipah virus","epidemic potential","geography","insight","viral proteins","RNA","significant association","end","Sporadic outbreaks","activity"],"language":"en"},

Efforts to restore grasslands often assume that removal of woody plants benefits biodiversity but assumptions are rarely tested. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the Southwestern United States, we tested whether abundances of grassland specialist bird species would be greater in plant communities resulting from treatment with herbicides to remove encroaching shrubs compared with untreated shrub\u2010dominated areas that represented pre\u2010treatment conditions. In 2010, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation at 16 treated\u2013untreated pairs. In 2011, we expanded the survey effort to 21 treated\u2013untreated pairs, seven unpaired treatment areas, and five reference grassland areas. Vegetation in treatment areas had higher perennial grass foliar and basal cover and lower shrub foliar cover compared with untreated areas. Several regionally declining grassland specialists exhibited higher occurrence and relative abundance in treated areas. A shrubland specialist, however, was associated with untreated areas and may be negatively impacted by shrub removal. Bird community composition differed between treated and untreated areas in both years.

Susceptible persons who contacted these contaminated surfaces may transfer the pathogens to their mucous membranes via hands, leading to a risk of respiratory infection. The exposure and infection risk contributed by this transmission route depend on indoor surface material, ventilation, and human behavior. In this study, quantitative infection risk assessments were used to compare the significances of these factors. The risks of three pathogens, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus, in an aircraft cabin and in a hospital ward were assessed. Results showed that reducing the contact rate is relatively more effective than increasing the ventilation rate to lower the infection risk. Nonfabric surface materials were found to be much more favorable in the indirect contact transmission for RSV and rhinovirus than fabric surface materials. In the cases considered in this study, halving the ventilation rate and doubling the hand contact rate to surfaces and the hand contact rate to mucous membranes would increase the risk by 3.7\u201316.2%, 34.4\u201394.2%, and 24.1\u2013117.7%, respectively.

Scouring and normal/control lambs were selected following a clinical examination, the scouring group was further divided into subgroups, specifically those that did or did not survive 72 h following treatment. At the time of the clinical examination, faecal and blood samples were taken. Faecal culture and commercial faecal antigen tests for detection of enteropathogens in faeces and serum endotoxin measurement using chromogenic lymulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) were carried out. Scouring lambs received 0.07 mg/kg liveweight halofuginone once a day for 3 days, a single oral dose of 0.20 mg/kg liveweight of spectinomycin and oral rehydration fluid. The pathogens isolated were Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli. The case fatality rate was 51% in the scouring lambs. Postmortem findings were consistent with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection. The concentration of endotoxin was 0.18 \u00B1 0.12 ng/ml in the control group, 0.35 \u00B1 0.17 ng/ml in the surviving lambs and 0.46 \u00B1 0.14 ng/ml in the non\u2010surviving lambs.

The activity of all cysteine peptidases depends on a catalytic dyad of cysteine and histidine. The order of the cysteine and histidine residues (Cys/His or His/Cys) in the linear sequence differs between families and this is among the lines of evidence suggesting that cysteine peptidases have had many separate evolutionary origins. The families C1, C2, and C10 can be described as \u201Cpapainlike,\u201D and form clan CA. The papain family contains peptidases with a wide variety of activities, including endopeptidases with broad specificity, endopeptidases with narrow specificity, aminopeptidases, and peptidases with both endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities. Papain homologs are generally either lysosomal or secreted proteins. The calpain family includes the calcium-dependent cytosolic endopeptidase calpain, which is known from birds and mammals, and the product of the sol gene in Drosophila. Calpain is a complex of two peptide chains. Picornains are a family of polyprotein-processing endopeptidases from single-stranded RNA viruses.

However, randomized evidence of its clinical effectiveness is lacking. We compared MMD within community ART refill groups (CARGs) vs. standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery in Zimbabwe. METHODS: A three-arm, cluster-randomized, pragmatic noninferiority trial was performed. Thirty health care facilities and associated CARGs were allocated to either ART collected three-monthly at facility (3MF, control); ART delivered three-monthly in CARGs (3MC); or ART delivered six-monthly in CARGs (6MC). Stable adults receiving ART \u2265six months with baseline viral load (VL) \u003C1000 copies/ml were eligible. Retention in ART care (primary outcome) and viral suppression (VS) 12 months after enrollment were compared, using regression models specified for clustering (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03238846). RESULTS: 4800 participants were recruited, 1919, 1335, and 1546 in arms 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. For retention, the prespecified noninferiority limit (-3.25%, risk difference [RD]) was met for comparisons between all arms, 3MC (94.8%) vs. 3MF (93.0%), adjusted RD = 1.1% (95% CI: -0.5% to 2.8%); 6MC (95.5%) vs. 3MF: aRD = 1.2% (95% CI: -1.0% to 3.6%); and 6MC vs. 3MC: aRD = 0.1% (95% CI: -2.4% to 2.6%). VL completion at 12 months was 49%, 45%, and 8% in 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. VS in 3MC (99.7%) was high and not different to 3MF (99.1%), relative risk = 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0-1.0). VS was marginally reduced in 6MC (92.9%) vs. 3MF, relative risk = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.9-1.0). CONCLUSION: Retention in CARGs receiving three- and six-monthly MMD was noninferior versus standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery. VS in 3MC was high.

This chapter describes that the immune aggregate should be incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00B0C and then left in the cold overnight. This is the optimum approach for a system, where the concentration of neither the antigen nor the antiserum is known, and maximum clumping is needed. However, with many systems these parameters have been established, and if it is known that clumping can be obtained readily, for example, as with the avian infectious bronchitis system, then incubation for 1 hour at 37\u00B0C is sufficient, followed by spinning at 10,000 rpm for half an hour. Viruses in the small to intermediate size range are ideal for immune studies, as the particles are not disproportionately larger than the antibody molecules attached to them, and interaction between them can be visualized with better than 10 a resolution. Particles as large as the poxviruses are becoming too large for good resolution of antibody molecules to be obtained, and aggregates of poxvirus particles are usually too dense to be recorded photographically except at low power. In the field of clinical virology, there is a possibility that the electron microscope technique of negative staining will become a standard method of diagnosis. As far as research is concerned, the present article seems to have described the beginnings that have been made in the visualization of several aspects of antigen-antibody interaction. Each line investigated has yielded a few answers, but of much greater importance, has led to a better understanding of what questions should be asked. At present, viral antigens can only occasionally be obtained in pure form, such that there are only a very few systems where controlled and specific virus-antigen-antibody systems can be visualized.","publish_time":"2008-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almeida, June D.; Waterson, A.P.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody systems","antibody interaction","hour","specific virus-antigen","good resolution of antibody molecules","electron microscope technique of negative staining","field of virus study","aspects of antigen","aggregates of poxvirus particles","knowledge of virus fine structure","immune studies","immune aggregate","years old","present article","better understanding","maximum clumping","field of clinical virology","avian infectious bronchitis system","intermediate size range","incubation","possibility","poxviruses","standard method of diagnosis","answers","antiserum","greater importance","example","recognition","viral antigens","questions","research","optimum approach","chapter","visualization","concentration","cold overnight","low power","pure form","line","beginnings","rpm","parameters"],"language":"en"},

Human erythrocytes contain N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), whereas mouse erythrocytes, which are also invaded by P. falciparum merozoites, contain 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac(2)) and N-glycoloylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), in addition to Neu5Ac. We compared the effects of sialidase and influenza C virus esterase treatments of mouse erythrocytes on invasion and the binding of a 175-kDa P. falciparum protein (EBA-175), a sialic acid-dependent malaria ligand implicated in the invasion process. Sialidase-treated mouse erythrocytes were refractory to invasion by P. falciparum merozoites and failed to bind EBA-175. Influenza C virus esterase, which converts Neu5,9Ac(2) to Neu5Ac, increased both invasion efficiency and EBA-175 binding to mouse erythrocytes. Thus, the parasite and EBA-175 discriminate between Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac(2), that is, the C-9 acetyl group interferes with EBA-175 binding and invasion by P.falciparum merozoites.

The HA protein facilitates the viral binding and entering a host cell and the NA protein helps the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from early strains of pandemic 2009 H1N1 of swine origin preferentially binds to human type receptors with a weak binding to avian type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 in Texas, USA, which motivated us to investigate the changes of genetic features that might contribute to the surged virulence of the virus. Our time series analysis on the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA binding preference of this virus in USA, Europe, and Asia has been the characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, its characteristic of seasonal human H1N1 and its binding avidity for avian type receptors both were on steady rise and had a clear increase in 2013 with American strains having the sharpest surge. The first change could enhance the viral transmission and replication in humans and the second could increase its ability to cause infection deep in lungs, which might account for the recent human deaths in Texas. In light of HA and NA coadaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also explored the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between HA and NA during the course of virus evolution. Finally we identified amino acid substitutions in HA and NA of the virus that were critical for the observed evolution.","publish_time":"2015-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"IEEE Trans Nanobioscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e1fa64549a730965eaa77c516863cae87fae118.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA","NA"],"locations":["Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["HA protein","NA protein","light of HA","HA binding preference","viral binding","NA coadaptation","NA activity","characteristic of swine H1N1 virus","human type receptors","course of virus evolution","complementary roles of HA","avian type receptors","viral replication","binding avidity","weak binding","viral transmission","characteristic of seasonal human H1N1","recent human deaths","American strains","H1N1 of swine origin","release of viral progeny","USA","Texas","early strains of pandemic","host cell","infected cell","clear increase","observed evolution","steady rise","important implications","evolutionary interactions","surface proteins","hemagglutinin","humans","fitness","Asia","amino acid substitutions","collaboration","functional balance","time series analysis","ability","subtypes","second","sharpest surge","Europe","neuraminidase","surged virulence","changes of genetic features","viruses","infection","lungs","Influenza"],"language":"en"},

During systematic increases in the NAVA level, feedback-controlled down-regulation of the EAdi results in a characteristic two-phased response in P(aw) and tidal volume (Vt). The transition from the 1st to the 2nd response phase allows identification of adequate unloading of the respiratory muscles with NAVA (NAVA(AL)). We aimed to develop and validate a mathematical algorithm to identify NAVA(AL). P(aw), Vt, and EAdi were recorded while systematically increasing the NAVA level in 19 adult patients. In a multistep approach, inspiratory P(aw) peaks were first identified by dividing the EAdi into inspiratory portions using Gaussian mixture modeling. Two polynomials were then fitted onto the curves of both P(aw) peaks and Vt. The beginning of the P(aw) and Vt plateaus, and thus NAVA (AL), was identified at the minimum of squared polynomial derivative and polynomial fitting errors. A graphical user interface was developed in the Matlab computing environment. Median NAVA(AL) visually estimated by 18 independent physicians was 2.7 (range 0.4 to 5.8) cm\u22C5H (2)O/ [Formula: see text] V and identified by our model was 2.6 (range 0.6 to 5.0) cm\u22C5H (2)O/ [Formula: see text] V.

Animal experiments indicated that when H1N1 virus infected early hosts, it showed strong CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B), and CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B )T cell reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic fluctuations of the peripheral blood lymphocyte subgroups in patients infected with H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV). METHODS: The frequency of T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and regulatory T cells (Treg) in 36 severe H1N1 and 40 moderate H1N1 patients were detected at different periods by flow cytometry. In parallel, serum cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and C-reactive protein (CRP) was analyzed through an image-type automatic biochemical analyzer. In addition, 20 healthy volunteers, who were not infected with 2009 H1N1 virus, were selected as controls. RESULTS: The frequency of NK cells were decreased in all cases and CD19(\u002B )B cells were increased in severe cases than those of the controls. At 1-2d from onset, the frequency of CD4(\u002B )and CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B )T cells in moderate cases was higher than in the severe cases. Serum cytokines, specifically IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03B3 exhibited no significant change both in the moderate and the severe cases during the whole monitoring process. In the early stage of the disease, serum CRP levels in the severe and moderate groups were significantly higher than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients showed different lymphocyte subgroup distributions between mild and severe cases, which might affect the incidence and development of 2009 H1N1.","publish_time":"2011-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Xichao; Chen, Yu; Li, Xuefen; Kong, Haishen; Yang, Shigui; Ye, Bo; Cui, Dawei; Wu, Wei; Li, Lanjuan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93519ea3491afa75ff874eaafe93efe6006c975d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3104371.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe H1N1","severe cases","moderate cases","moderate H1N1 patients","frequency of T cells","B cells","regulatory T cells","frequency of NK cells","frequency of CD4","H1N1 virus infected early hosts","H1N1 swine-origin influenza","moderate groups","serum cytokines","strong CD4","serum CRP levels","T cell reactions","CD25","controls","different lymphocyte subgroup distributions","different periods","early stage","Novel Influenza","peripheral blood lymphocyte subgroups","acute respiratory infectious disease","natural killer","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","C-reactive protein","dynamic fluctuations","Treg","image-type automatic biochemical analyzer","significant change","CONCLUSIONS","IFN-\u03B3","S-OIV","Animal experiments","study","flow cytometry","onset","BACKGROUND","CD8","monitoring process","incidence","RESULTS","CD19","METHODS","addition","healthy volunteers","control group","development","aim"],"language":"en"},

In particular, genetic data coupled with dates and locations of sampled isolates can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have been used to tackle this issue. Although these approaches have proved useful for informing on the spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly reconstructing the underlying transmission tree. Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks, where the sample includes ancestral and descendent isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can efficiently reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide spread of this new influenza strain. The presented methodology opens new perspectives for the analysis of genetic data in the context of disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2010-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jombart, T; Eggo, R M; Dodd, P J; Balloux, F","journal":"Heredity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c9c0f9d91cb34e576d94d77525259cca0aaafa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3183872.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of genetic data","simulated data","analysis of genetic sequence data","genealogies of isolates","pairs of isolates","descendent isolates","locations of sampled isolates","sampled recent outbreaks","phylogenetic models","classical phylogenetic approaches","spread of pathogens","phylogenetic methods","new influenza strain","context of disease outbreaks","new perspectives","worldwide spread","graph approach","transmission trees","novel method","recent common ancestors","H1N1 influenza pandemic","underlying transmission tree","spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens","dates","swine-origin","situations","likely history","early stages","neuraminidase genes","presented methodology","public health planning","Epidemiology","hemagglutinin","paper","issue"],"language":"en"},

The orbivirus genome, composed of 10 segments of dsRNA, encodes 7 structural proteins (VP1\u2013VP7) and 3 non-structural proteins (NS1\u2013NS3). An open reading frame (ORF) that spans almost the entire length of genome segment-9 (Seg-9) encodes VP6 (the viral helicase). However, bioinformatic analysis recently identified an overlapping ORF (ORFX) in Seg-9. We show that ORFX encodes a new non-structural protein, identified here as NS4. Western blotting and confocal fluorescence microscopy, using antibodies raised against recombinant NS4 from Bluetongue virus (BTV, which is insect-borne), or Great Island virus (GIV, which is tick-borne), demonstrate that these proteins are synthesised in BTV or GIV infected mammalian cells, respectively. BTV NS4 is also expressed in Culicoides insect cells. NS4 forms aggregates throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, consistent with identification of nuclear localisation signals within the NS4 sequence. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that NS4 contains coiled-coils, is related to proteins that bind nucleic acids, or are associated with membranes and shows similarities to nucleolar protein UTP20 (a processome subunit). Recombinant NS4 of GIV protects dsRNA from degradation by endoribonucleases of the RNAse III family, indicating that it interacts with dsRNA. However, BTV NS4, which is only half the putative size of the GIV NS4, did not protect dsRNA from RNAse III cleavage. NS4 of both GIV and BTV protect DNA from degradation by DNAse. NS4 was found to associate with lipid droplets in cells infected with BTV or GIV or transfected with a plasmid expressing NS4.","publish_time":"2011-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belhouchet, Mourad; Mohd Jaafar, Fauziah; Firth, Andrew E.; Grimes, Jonathan M.; Mertens, Peter P.

It also describes the context of publicly funded blood transfusion in Canada and the withdrawal event that is the basis of this study. METHODS: Interviews with 45 experts from administration, medicine, blood supply, laboratory services and risk assessment took place using a multi-level sampling framework in the aftermath of the recall. These experts either directly dealt with the withdrawal or were involved in the management of the blood supply at the national level. Data from these interviews were coded in NVivo for analysis and interpretation. Analytically, data were interpreted to derive typifications to relate interview responses to risk management heuristics. RESULTS: While all those interviewed agreed on the importance of patient safety, differences in the ways in which the risk was contextualized and explicated were discerned. Risk was seen in terms of patient safety, liability or precaution. These different risk logics are illustrated by selected quotations. CONCLUSIONS: Expert assessments did not fully converge and it is possible that these different risk logics and discourses may affect the risk management process more generally, although not necessarily in a negative way. Patient safety is not to be compromised but management of blood risk in publicly funded systems may vary. We suggest ways of managing blood risk using formal and safety case approaches.","publish_time":"2011-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eyles, John; Heddle, Nancy; Webert, Kathryn; Arnold, Emmy; McCurdy, Bronwen","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f15e87968807693e3f40d6860371641a5f399039.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3223866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3223866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["management of blood risk","risk assessment","risk management heuristics","risk management process","different risk logics","perceptions of minimal risk","blood supply","blood product recall","funded blood transfusion","terms of patient safety","importance of patient safety","withdrawal event","safety case approaches","ways","Interviews","experts","Data","professional assessments","national level","funded systems","Expert assessments","multi-level sampling framework","place","laboratory services","paper","ideas","medicine","implications","discourses","aftermath","public health","interview responses","Canada","administration","liability","typifications","differences","selected quotations","NVivo","analysis","basis","context","precaution","interpretation","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","negative way","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

One important precursor currently used for the production of Relenza, an antiviral product from GlaxoSmithKline, is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc). This substance has a considerably high market price despite efforts to develop cost-reducing (biotechnological) production processes. Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) is a saprophyte noted for its abundant secretion of hydrolytic enzymes and its potential to degrade chitin to its monomer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Chitin is considered the second most abundant biomass available on earth and therefore an attractive raw material. RESULTS: In this study, we introduced two enzymes from bacterial origin into Hypocrea, which convert GlcNAc into NeuNAc via N-acetylmannosamine. This enabled the fungus to produce NeuNAc from the cheap starting material chitin in liquid culture. Furthermore, we expressed the two recombinant enzymes as GST-fusion proteins and developed an enzyme assay for monitoring their enzymatic functionality. Finally, we demonstrated that Hypocrea does not metabolize NeuNAc and that no NeuNAc-uptake by the fungus occurs, which are important prerequisites for a potential production strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a proof of concept for the possibility to engineer in a filamentous fungus a bacterial enzyme cascade, which is fully functional. Furthermore, it provides the basis for the development of a process for NeuNAc production as well as a general prospective design for production processes that use saprophytes as whole-cell catalysts.","publish_time":"2011-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steiger, Matthias G; Mach-Aigner, Astrid R; Gorsche, Rita; Rosenberg, Erwin E; Mihovilovic, Marko D; Mach, Robert L","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f95edc5945b23b648fb540c0b715e36f58b49849.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3245449.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245449/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hypocrea","Chitin"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NeuNAc production","production processes","NeuNAc-uptake","production of Relenza","potential production strategy","recombinant enzymes","filamentous fungus","N-acetylmannosamine","GlcNAc","Hypocrea jecorina","study","cheap starting material chitin","abundant secretion of hydrolytic enzymes","bacterial enzyme cascade","monomer N-acetylglucosamine","N-acetylneuraminic acid","abundant biomass available","available antiviral drugs","enzyme assay","antiviral product","important prerequisites","bacterial origin","important precursor","attractive raw material","GlaxoSmithKline","earth","GST-fusion proteins","general prospective design","need","cost","liquid culture","saprophytes","high market price","SARS","efforts","Trichoderma reesei","possibility","development","proof of concept","Recent incidents","influenza epidemics","substance","enzymatic functionality","BACKGROUND","cell catalysts","basis","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

As they may seriously impact the circulation of certain parasites and the emergence and management of infectious diseases, their study is essential. In the field, detecting parasite interactions is rendered difficult by the fact that a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. To correct for these \u201Cfalse interactions\u201D, methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present paper we propose such a method for presence-absence data (i.e., serology). Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic. The method is termed \u201Cthe corrected chi-square.\u201D Its robustness was compared to a pre-existing method based on logistic regression and the corrected chi-square proved to be much more robust for small sample sizes. Since the logistic regression approach is easier to implement, we propose as a rule of thumb to use the latter when the ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters is above ten. Applied to serological data for four viruses infecting cats, the approach revealed pairwise interactions between the Feline Herpesvirus, Parvovirus and Calicivirus, whereas the infection by FIV, the feline equivalent of HIV, did not modify the risk of infection by any of these viruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work therefore points out possible interactions that can be further investigated in experimental conditions and, by providing a user-friendly R program and a tutorial example, offers new opportunities for animal and human epidemiologists to detect interactions of interest in the field, a crucial step in the challenge of multiple infections.","publish_time":"2012-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hellard, El\u00E9onore; Pontier, Dominique; Sauvage, Frank; Poulet, Herv\u00E9; Fouchet, David","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/315303952d93ba93f55029cca73e2f483bc16362.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3250451.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250451/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["possible interactions","false interactions","interspecific parasite interactions","parasite risk factors","pre-existing method","risk of infection","corrected chi-square","common risk factors","logistic regression approach","chi-square statistic","viruses","field","double infected individuals","challenge of multiple infections","large number of co-infected individuals","Feline Herpesvirus","host individual","number of parameters","serological data","observed ones","natural host populations","feline equivalent of HIV","circulation of certain parasites","presence-absence data","small sample sizes","tutorial example","new opportunities","emergence","animal","expected frequencies of single","management of infectious diseases","FIV","Calicivirus","human epidemiologists","Parvovirus","cats","methods","crucial step","user-friendly R program","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","study","present paper","calculation","independence hypothesis","work","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODOLOGY","ratio","serology","robustness","experimental conditions","rule of thumb"],"language":"en"},

CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4S, two isoforms produced by differential splicing, are predominant in rat liver. Previous work has shown that downregulation of both isoforms occurs in rat hepatocellular carcinomas. Here, we have isolated an anchorage dependent clone, designated 253T-NT that does not express detectable levels of CEACAM1. Stable transfection of 253-NT cells with a wild type CEACAM1-4S expression vector induced an anchorage independent growth in vitro and a tumorigenic phenotype in vivo. These phenotypes were used as quantifiable end points to examine the functionality of the CEACAM1-4S transmembrane domain. Examination of the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain showed N-terminal GXXXG dimerization sequences and C-terminal tyrosine residues shown in related studies to stabilize transmembrane domain helix-helix interactions. To examine the effects of transmembrane domain mutations, 253-NT cells were transfected with transmembrane domain mutants carrying glycine to leucine or tyrosine to valine substitutions. Results showed that mutation of transmembrane tyrosine residues greatly enhanced growth in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of transmembrane dimerization motifs, in contrast, significantly reduced anchorage independent growth and tumorigenicity. 253-NT cells expressing CEACAM1-4S with both glycine to leucine and tyrosine to valine mutations displayed the growth-enhanced phenotype of tyrosine mutants. The dramatic effect of transmembrane domain mutations constitutes strong evidence that the transmembrane domain is an important determinant of CEACAM1-4S functionality and most likely by other proteins with transmembrane domains containing dimerization sequences and/or C-terminal tyrosine residues.","publish_time":"2012-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawson, Erica L.; Mills, David R.; Brilliant, Kate E.; Hixson, Douglas C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2239f23b3b6738f24cd381b0ee59faaf39a8a027.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3250453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEACAM1 transmembrane domain","S transmembrane domain","transmembrane domain mutants","transmembrane domains","effects of transmembrane domain mutations","mutation of transmembrane tyrosine residues","dramatic effect of transmembrane domain mutations","transmembrane domain helix-helix interactions","Mutation of transmembrane dimerization motifs","NT cells","wild type CEACAM1","important determinant of CEACAM1","C-terminal tyrosine residues","S functionality","growth-enhanced phenotype of tyrosine mutants","enhanced growth","express detectable levels of CEACAM1","valine mutations","reduced anchorage independent growth","epithelial cells","T-NT","S expression vector","N-terminal GXXXG dimerization sequences","leucine","glycine","isoforms","anchorage dependent clone","valine substitutions","tumorigenic phenotype","rat liver","rat hepatocellular carcinomas","contrast","related studies","strong evidence","cell adhesion molecule","proteins","multifunctional Ig","differential splicing","quantifiable end points","downregulation","tumorigenicity","phenotypes","Stable transfection","Results","Examination","Previous work","organs"],"language":"en"},

The use of colostrum or milk as a source of immunoglobulins, whether intended for the neonate of the species producing the secretion or for a different species, can be viewed in the context of the types of immunoglobulins in the secretion, the mechanisms by which the immunoglobulins are secreted, and the mechanisms by which the neonate or adult consuming the milk then gains immunological benefit.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real-time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months\u0027 treatment course. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and P = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept which views psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.","publish_time":"2010-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohamed Attia, Hanaa Rasmy; Mikhael, Nancy; Ismail, Somaia","journal":"Arch Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c042a8ca113beaec285ea086b0d1722eb838115f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3302712.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psoriatic skin lesions","uninvolved skin","lesional psoriatic skin","keratinocytes","psoriatic lesions","studied patients IL","change of expression","lesional skin biopsy","increased IL","gene expression analysis","study","clinical severity of psoriasis","months\u0027 treatment course","patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis","disease duration","autoimmune disease","therapeutic interventions","comparison","form of topical steroids","end","concept","oral systemic methotrexate","correlation","T-cell","real-time quantitative PCR","preventive approaches","METHODS","improved outcomes","CONCLUSIONS","INTRODUCTION","aim","MATERIAL","RESULTS","Interleukin","biopsies"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak, initiated by a traveler to Hong Kong in late February 2003, led to sequential spread of SARS to three major acute care hospitals in Singapore. The critical factor in containing this outbreak was early detection and complete assessment of movements and follow-up of patients, healthcare workers, and visitors who were contacts. Visitor records were important in helping identify exposed persons who could carry the infection into the community. In the three hospital outbreaks, three different containment strategies were used to contain spread of infection: closing an entire hospital, removing all potentially infected persons to a dedicated SARS hospital, and managing exposed persons in place. On the basis of this experience, if a nosocomial outbreak is detected late, a hospital may need to be closed in order to contain spread of the disease. Outbreaks detected early can be managed by either removing all exposed persons to a designated location or isolating and managing them in place.","publish_time":"2004-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gopalakrishna, Gowri; Choo, Philip; Leo, Yee Sin; Tay, Boon Keng; Lim, Yean Teng; Khan, Ali S.; Tan, Chorh Chuan","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1501d93b454fa850a635ceed555f5266bc1db6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3322797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzMzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Singapore","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["exposed persons","hospital outbreaks","dedicated SARS hospital","infected persons","entire hospital","nosocomial outbreak","spread of infection","sequential spread of SARS","Singapore","place","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","early detection","major acute care hospitals","complete assessment of movements","follow-up of patients","healthcare workers","different containment strategies","visitors","traveler","Hong Kong","experience","designated location","Visitor records","critical factor","contacts","order","disease","basis","beginning","community"],"language":"en"},

We here analyze the early consequences of IFN\u03B1 therapy on both thymic function and peripheral T-cell homeostasis in patients in the acute or chronic phase of HCV-infection as well as in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The evolution of T-cell subsets and T-cell homeostasis were estimated by flow cytometry while thymic function was measured through quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and estimation of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation during the first four months following the initiation of IFN\u03B1 therapy. Beginning with the first month of therapy, a profound lymphocytopenia was observed for all T-cell subsets, including na\u00EFve T-cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE), associated with inhibition of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation. Interleukin (IL)-7 plasma concentration rapidly dropped while lymphocytopenia progressed. This was neither a consequence of higher consumption of the cytokine nor due to its neutralization by soluble CD127. Decrease in IL-7 plasma concentration under IFN\u03B1 therapy correlated with the decline in HCV viral load, thymic activity and RTE concentration in blood. These data demonstrate that IFN\u03B1-based therapy rapidly impacts on thymopoiesis and, consequently, perturbs T-cell homeostasis. Such a side effect might be detrimental for the continuation of IFN\u03B1 therapy and may lead to an increased level of infectious risk, in particular in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Altogether, this study suggests the therapeutic potential of IL-7 in the maintenance of peripheral T-cell homeostasis in IFN\u03B1-treated patients.","publish_time":"2012-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beq, Stephanie; Rozlan, Sandra; Pelletier, Sandy; Willems, Bernard; Bruneau, Julie; Lelievre, Jean-Daniel; Levy, Yves; Shoukry, Naglaa H.; Cheynier, R\u00E9mi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83d77dc0616b9b240d13a844c7135dc250773fe0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3328332.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/HCV","RTE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cell subsets","quantification of T","evolution of T","maintenance of peripheral T-cell homeostasis","strong peripheral T-cell lymphocytopenia","continuation of IFN\u03B1 therapy","IFN\u03B1-based therapy","initiation of IFN\u03B1 therapy","estimation of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation","inhibition of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation","na\u00EFve T-cells","IFN\u03B1-treated patients","month of therapy","early consequences of IFN\u03B1 therapy","cell receptor excision circles","HCV co-infected patients","thymic function","curing HCV infection","thymic activity","RTE concentration","plasma concentration","HCV viral load","chronic phase of HCV","recent thymic emigrants","HIV","profound lymphocytopenia","therapeutic potential of IL","particular inducement","TREC","good efficacy","decline","flow cytometry","months","increased level of infectious risk","cytokine","effects","blood","neutralization","consequence of higher consumption","study","Interferon alpha","data","thymopoiesis","soluble CD127","Interleukin"],"language":"en"},

The latter collectively represent a major and underappreciated form of animal diversity. Factors influencing this macroevolutionary (above the species level) pattern of novelty are considered and include adoption of different life styles, life histories, and body plans; a general advantage of being distinctive with respect to immune defenses; and the responses required to cope with parasites, many of which afflict hosts in a lineage-specific manner. This large-scale pattern of novelty implies that immunological phenomena can affect microevolutionary processes (at the population level within species) that can eventually lead to macroevolutionary events such as speciation, radiations, or extinctions. Immunologically based phenomena play a role in favoring intraspecific diversification, specialization and host specificity of parasites, and mechanisms are discussed whereby this could lead to parasite speciation. Host switching \u2013 the acquisition of new host species by parasites \u2013 is a major mechanism that drives parasite diversity and is frequently involved in disease emergence. It is also one that can be favored by reductions in immune competence of new hosts. Mechanisms involving immune phenomena favoring intraspecific diversification and speciation of host species are also discussed. A macroevolutionary perspective on immunology is invaluable in today\u2019s world, including the need to study a broader range of species with distinctive immune systems.

All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.","publish_time":"1999-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halonen, Pekka; Herholzer, John; Ziegler, Thedi","journal":"Clin Diagn Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","EIA IgG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of respiratory virus infections","detection of respiratory virus DNA","respiratory syncytial virus","immunofluorescence detection of virus antigens","sensitivity of virus culture","early detection of respiratory virus growth","Immunofluorescence tests","development of diagnostic tests","re-infections","primary infections","results of rapid diagnostic tests","clinical specimens","sensitivity of new diagnostic tests","sensitive method","treatment of specimens","EIA IgG antibody tests","choice of diagnostic methods","basic diagnostic method","large number of specimens","biotin-EIAs","laboratory","sensitive serological test","daily diagnostic work","rapid culture assays","all-monoclonal TR-FIAs","testing of large numbers of specimens","practical methods","PCR technology","IgG EIA","sensitive antigen detections","biotin-enzyme immunoassays","IgG avidity test","production of monoclonal antibodies","sensitive cell lines","rhinovirus RNA","adenovirus DNA","Group-specific detection of enteroviruses","clinical samples","previous experience","larger role of PCR","practical techniques","IgM antibody assays","Recombinant antigens","experienced laboratories","Advances","valuable reference method","printed test result","best choice","epithelial cells","experienced microscopist","epidemiological studies","low sensitivities","small laboratories","convalescent phase sera","liquid-phase hybridization","nasopharyngeal aspirates","isolation","future developments","hospitals","example","rhinoviruses","good UV microscope","fluoroimmunoassays","time","provision","improved possibilities","type","specimen transportation","polymerase chain reaction","improvements","review","potential","stability","hand","years","location","RSV","study design","BIOTH-E","nonspecific inhibitors","Objectives","experiences","extracts","Conclusions","identification","fluorescence microscopy","cross-contamination","advantages","Background","specificities"],"language":"en"},

In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.","publish_time":"2004-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gombold, James L.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHC expression","MHC class","enhancement of MHC mRNA","enhanced MHC mRNA expression","MHC levels","MHC induction","MHC surface antigens","steady-state level of MHC mRNA","MHV-A59 infection","transient expression","mechanism of MHV","areas of infection","days of infection","brains of infected animals","A59 results","Viral RNA","uninfected cells","Infection of mixed glial cell cultures","situ hybridization of glial cell cultures","fold increase","viral replication","situ hybridization of brain sections","small foci of cells","limbic system","level of major histocompatibility complex","murine central nervous system","Northern blot analysis of RNA","mouse hepatitis virus","astrocytes","CNS","earlier finding","oligodendrocytes","hypothesis","contrast","portions","spatial relationship","soluble mediator","induced disease","clearance","inflammation","fact"],"language":"en"},

The following classification was used: squamous cell metaplasia with marked keratinization, keratinizing cyst, cystic keratinizing epithelioma, cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. In study A (inhalation of coal oven exhaust and subcutaneous injection of a high dose of DB (ah)A) 49.3 % of rats developed cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Inhalation of coal oven exhaust gas together with intratracheal instillation of crocidolite or subcutaneous injection of a low dose DB(ah)A (dibenz(ah)anthracene) resulted in cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas in 23 % to 24 % of the rats. High incidences of cystic squamous cell carcinomas in the range of 31.9 % to 76.4 % were observed in rats of Study B1 after a 10-months exposure to tar/pitch condensation aerosol (different B(a)P (benzo(a)pyrene) concentrations) with added carbon black in some groups. After a 20-months exposure period to the same inhalation atmospheres (Study B2) the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas was increased up to 95.8 %.

We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development.

CMV entry into fibroblasts differs significantly from entry into epithelial or endothelial cells: fibroblast entry is mediated by gB and gH/gL/gO, whereas both epithelial and endothelial cell entry require an additional pentameric complex (PC) comprised of gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A. Because PC-specific antibodies in CMV-seropositive human sera do not affect fibroblast entry but potently block entry into epithelial or endothelial cells, substantially higher neutralizing potencies for CMV-positive sera are observed when assayed using epithelial cells as targets than when using fibroblasts. That certain sera exhibit similar discordances between neutralizing potencies measured using epithelial vs. endothelial cells (Gerna G. et al.J Gen Virol, 89:853\u2013865, 2008) suggested that additional mechanistic differences may also exist between epithelial and endothelial cell entry. To further explore this issue, neutralizing potencies using epithelial and endothelial cells were simultaneously determined for eight CMV-positive human sera, CMV-hyperimmune globulin, and a panel of monoclonal or anti-peptide antibodies targeting specific epitopes in gB, gH, gH/gL, or the PC. No significant differences were observed between epithelial and endothelial neutralizing potencies of epitope-specific antibodies, CMV-hyperimmune globulin, or seven of the eight human sera. However, one human serum exhibited a six-fold higher potency for neutralizing entry into epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells. These results suggest that epitopes exist that are important for epithelial entry but are less critical, or perhaps dispensable, for endothelial cell entry. Their existence should be considered when developing monoclonal antibody therapies or subunit vaccines representing limited epitopes.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Ying; He, Li; Cui, Xiaohong; Hertel, Laura; Freed, Daniel C.; Fu, Tong-Ming; Kauvar, Lawrence M.; McVoy, Michael A.; Ruan, Qiang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab1d1115aa952d1f237cae65c28f676369ed7135.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gerna G. et al.J Gen Virol"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epithelial entry","CMV entry","epithelial cells","neutralizing entry","endothelial cell entry","endothelial cells","fibroblast entry","endothelial neutralizing potencies of epitope","CMV-positive sera","CMV-positive human sera","CMV-seropositive human sera","higher neutralizing potencies","CMV-hyperimmune globulin","specific epitopes","PC-specific antibodies","certain sera","human serum","gB","diverse cell types","limited epitopes","fibroblasts","anti-peptide antibodies","monoclonal antibody therapies","additional mechanistic differences","panel of monoclonal","subunit vaccines","higher potency","development of vaccines","significant differences","additional pentameric complex","Antibody neutralization of cytomegalovirus","key consideration","Gerna","similar discordances","UL128","UL130","J Gen Virol","immunotherapeutics","UL131A","targets","issue","existence","results"],"language":"en"},

The surface was incubated in a solution containing phage M13KO7, which was trapped by the antibody GP3 with the interaction between phage M13KO7 and antibody GP3, resulting in a variation of layer thickness that was detected by imaging ellipsometry. The results showed a saturated layer of antibody GP3 with a thickness about 6.9 nm on the surface of the silicon wafer. The specific interaction between phage M13KO7 and antibody GP3 resulted in a variation of layer thickness. The layer of phage M13KO7 bound with antibody GP3 was 17.5 nm in the concentration of 1.1\u00D710(10) pfu/mL. Each variation of the layer thickness corresponded to a concentration of phage M13KO7 in the range of 0.1\u00D710(10)\u20132.5\u00D710(10) pfu/mL, with the sensitivity of 10(9) pfu/mL.

This study could be significant on the interactions between the antibody and the virus, showing potential in the early diagnosis of virosis.","publish_time":"2006-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"QI, Cai; FENG, Jing; WANG, Zhan-Hui; MENG, Yong-Hong; YAN, Xi-Yun; JIN, Gang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcf68af51410b9b024d9f5e3b41b3330df5d0276.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Silicon"],"keyphrases":["layer of phage M13KO7","saturated layer of antibody GP3","variation of layer thickness","concentration of phage M13KO7","Avidin layer","pfu","specific interaction","substrate surface of Silicon wafer","nm","immobilization of mouse monoclonal biotin-anti-M13","label free","short measurement time","potential","optical protein-chip","interactions","virus","early diagnosis of virosis","methods","quantitative test","aldehyde","results","range","solution","imaging ellipsometry","study","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, the most successful LAVs, such as the smallpox vaccine, the measles vaccine, and the yellow fever vaccine, have been isolated and/or developed in a purely empirical manner without any understanding of the immunological mechanisms they trigger. Today, the mechanisms governing potent LAV immunogenicity and long-term induced protective immunity continue to be elusive, and therefore hamper the rational design of innovative vaccine strategies. A serious roadblock to understanding LAV-induced immunity has been the lack of suitable and cost-effective animal models that can accurately mimic human immune responses. In the last two decades, human-immune system mice (HIS mice), i.e., mice engrafted with components of the human immune system, have been instrumental in investigating the life-cycle and immune responses to multiple human-tropic pathogens. However, their use in LAV research has remained limited.

The cellular antiviral protein ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein) binds CpGs and inhibits HIV-1 replication when CpGs are introduced into the viral genome. However, it is not known if ZAP-mediated restriction is the only mechanism driving CpG suppression. To determine how CpG dinucleotides affect HIV-1 replication, we increased their abundance in multiple regions of the viral genome and analyzed the effect on RNA expression, protein abundance, and infectious-virus production. We found that the antiviral effect of CpGs was not correlated with their abundance. Interestingly, CpGs inserted into some regions of the genome sensitize the virus to ZAP antiviral activity more efficiently than insertions into other regions, and this sensitivity can be modulated by interferon treatment or ZAP overexpression. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the virus to endogenous ZAP was correlated with its sensitivity to the ZAP cofactor KHNYN. Finally, we show that CpGs in some contexts can also inhibit HIV-1 replication by ZAP-independent mechanisms, and one of these is the activation of a cryptic splice site at the expense of a canonical splice site. Overall, we show that the location and sequence context of the CpG in the viral genome determines its antiviral activity. IMPORTANCE Some RNA virus genomes are suppressed in the nucleotide combination of a cytosine followed by a guanosine (CpG), indicating that they are detrimental to the virus. The antiviral protein ZAP binds viral RNA containing CpGs and prevents the virus from multiplying. However, it remains unknown how the number and position of CpGs in viral genomes affect restriction by ZAP and whether CpGs have other antiviral mechanisms. Importantly, manipulating the CpG content in viral genomes could help create new vaccines. HIV-1 shows marked CpG suppression, and by introducing CpGs into its genome, we show that ZAP efficiently targets a specific region of the viral genome, that the number of CpGs does not predict the magnitude of antiviral activity, and that CpGs can inhibit HIV-1 gene expression through a ZAP-independent mechanism.

Including memory effects in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model seems very appropriate for such an investigation.

All models have the same epidemic thresholds in mean-field theories but depending on the network properties, simulations yield a dual scenario, in which the epidemic thresholds of the modified SIS models can be either dramatically altered or remain unchanged in comparison with the standard dynamics. For uncorrelated synthetic networks having a power-law degree distribution with exponent [Formula: see text] , the SIS dynamics are robust exhibiting essentially the same outcomes for all investigated models. A threshold in better agreement with the heterogeneous rather than quenched mean-field theory is observed in the modified dynamics for exponent [Formula: see text]. Differences are more remarkable for [Formula: see text] , where a finite threshold is found in the modified models in contrast with the vanishing threshold of the original one. This duality is elucidated in terms of epidemic lifespan on star graphs. We verify that the activation of the modified SIS models is triggered in the innermost component of the network given by a [Formula: see text]-core decomposition for [Formula: see text] while it happens only for [Formula: see text] in the standard model.

The purpose of this Rapid Communication is to show that the presence of power-law distributions for the size of neuronal avalanches is not a sufficient condition for the system to operate near criticality.

In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to examine the association between avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents for urgent tracheal intubation and incidence of tracheostomy among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The setting of this study was an eight-bed ICU at a tertiary-care hospital in Okayama, Japan. We included patients who underwent urgent tracheal intubation at the emergency department or the ICU and were admitted to the ICU between April 2013 and November 2017. We extracted data on methods and medications of intubation, predictors for difficult intubation, Cormack\u2013Lehane grade, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reintubation. We estimated odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for elective tracheostomy during the ICU stay using logistic regression models. Of 411 patients, 46 patients underwent intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents and 61 patients underwent tracheostomy. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients who avoided neuromuscular blocking agents had more than double the odds of tracheostomy (odds ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.06\u20136.34, p value = 0.04). When stratifying the subjects by risk status for tracheostomy, the association was more pronounced in high-risk group, while we observed less significant association in the low-risk group. Avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents for urgent intubation increases the risk of tracheostomy among emergency patients, especially those who have a higher risk for tracheostomy.

Our aim was to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative assessment of rectal/throat ESBL-E carriage can predict ESBL-E-associated VAP in medical ICU patients. METHODS: From May 2014 to May 2017, all ESBL-E carriers had a semi-quantitative assessment of ESBL-E density in swabs cultures. For those who developed GNB-VAP (diagnosed using bronchoalveolar lavage or plugged telescopic catheter with significant quantitative culture), the last positive swab collected at least 48 h before GNB-VAP onset was selected. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: Among 365 ESBL-E carriers, 82 developed 107 episodes of GNB-VAP (ESBL-E VAP, n = 50; and non-ESBL-E GNB-VAP, n = 57) after 13 days of mechanical ventilation in median. Antimicrobials use before VAP onset was similar between groups. The last swabs were collected 5 days in median before VAP onset. ESBL-E. coli carriers developed ESBL-E VAP less frequently (n = 13, 34%) than others (n = 32, 67.3%, p \u003C .01). Throat swab positivity (39 (78%) vs. 12 (23%), p \u003C .01) was more frequent for ESBL-E VAP. ESBL-E VAP was associated with significantly higher ESBL-E density in rectal swabs. In multivariate models, non-E. coli ESBL-E carriage and rectal ESBL-E carriage density, or throat carriage, remained associated with ESBL-E VAP. CONCLUSION: In carriers of ESBL-E other than E. coli, ESBL-E throat carriage or a high-density ESBL-E rectal carriage are risk factors of ESBL-E VAP in case of GNB-VAP.

The same problem may arise for homologous proteins of different functions if one is newly discovered and the other is the only known protein of similar sequence. It is desirable to explore methods that are not based on sequence similarity. One approach is to assign functional family of a protein to provide useful hint about its function. Several groups have employed a statistical learning method, support vector machines (SVMs), for predicting protein functional family directly from sequence irrespective of sequence similarity. These studies showed that SVM prediction accuracy is at a level useful for functional family assignment. But its capability for assignment of distantly related proteins and homologous proteins of different functions has not been critically and adequately assessed. Here SVM is tested for functional family assignment of two groups of enzymes. One consists of 50 enzymes that have no homolog of known function from PSI-BLAST search of protein databases. The other contains eight pairs of homologous enzymes of different families. SVM correctly assigns 72% of the enzymes in the first group and 62% of the enzyme pairs in the second group, suggesting that it is potentially useful for facilitating functional study of novel proteins.

Harnessing the innate immune system to non-specifically respond to viral infection has the advantage of being able to circumvent viral mutations that render the virus resistant to a particular therapeutic agent. Viruses are recognized by various cellular receptors, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 which recognizes double-stranded (ds)RNA produced during the viral replication cycle. TLR3 agonists include synthetic dsRNA such as poly (IC), poly (ICLC) and poly (AU). These agents have been evaluated and found to be effective against a number of viral agents. One major limitation has been the toxicity associated with administration of these drugs. Significant time and effort have been spent to develop alternatives/modifications that will minimize these adverse effects. This review will focus on the TLR3 agonist, poly (IC)/(ICLC) with respect to its use in treatment/prevention of respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2011-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christopher, ME; Wong, JP","journal":"Antiinflamm Antiallergy Agents Med Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/406aad9b3f74f619a1aac3f29ad531b28fb7c37e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3552307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poly","viral mutations","number of viral agents","viral replication cycle","prevention of respiratory viral infections","ICLC","Respiratory RNA viruses","therapeutic strategies","TLR3 agonists","particular therapeutic agent","treatment","virus resistant","Toll","synthetic dsRNA","various cellular receptors","toxicity","development of additional prophylactic","advantage","effort","modifications","respect","innate immune system","Significant time","adverse effects","major limitation","administration","drugs","alternatives","review","AU"],"language":"en"},

Using a Multisectoral One Health Approach to Prioritize Zoonotic Diseases in the United States","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofy210.683","pmcid":"PMC6254946","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Emerging and endemic zoonoses continue to have adverse global impacts. One Health approaches promoting multisectoral, transdisciplinary collaboration are important methods to address zoonoses threats through disease surveillance, prevention, control, and response. We conducted a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) workshop in the United States (US) to identify zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern that should be jointly addressed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of the Interior, and partners. METHODS: We used CDC\u2019s OHZDP tool to prioritize zoonoses. Workshop participants selected criteria for prioritization, and developed questions and weights for each criterion. Questions were answered using available literature and expert opinion with subsequent scoring resulting in a ranked zoonotic disease list. After agreeing on a final prioritized disease list, participants used components of the One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit, developed by USDA and University of Minnesota, to review multidisciplinary coordination processes for the prioritized zoonotic diseases. RESULTS: Participants selected epidemic or pandemic potential, disease severity, economic impact, introduction or increased transmission potential, and national security as criteria to prioritize 56 zoonoses. The eight prioritized zoonotic diseases for the US were zoonotic influenzas, salmonellosis, West Nile virus, plague, emerging coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), rabies, brucellosis, and Lyme disease. Agencies then discussed recommendations to enhance One Health approaches to surveillance, response, prevention, and control of the prioritized zoonoses. Key themes and next steps for further implementation of One Health approaches were identified. CONCLUSION: This OHZDP workshop represents the first use of a One Health approach to zoonotic disease prioritization in the United States. It is a critical step forward in US government agency collaboration using One Health approaches. Further, the workshop created a foundation for future US government One Health systems strengthening for the prioritized zoonoses.

The Role of Respiratory Panel PCR in Decreasing Antibiotic Exposure in Patients Diagnosed With a Respiratory Viral Infection","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.2463","pmcid":"PMC6809478","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are becoming increasingly recognized as an important cause of pneumonia. There is limited data regarding the role of rapid PCR testing for RVI and its effect on antibiotic duration and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective chart review in adult patients who were admitted and underwent evaluation with the FilmArray Multiplex Respiratory Panel (RP) (Biomerieux\u2122) using a random sample from July 1, 2016 through April 1, 2018. Patient clinical and virologic characteristics, LOS, antibiotic use, and duration of treatment were collected. A Student\u2019s t-test was performed for all comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 540 patients who were admitted and underwent RP testing. The mean age was 57.1 years (range 19\u201399), 50.2% were immunocompromised, 23.8% were transplant recipients, 70.4% had respiratory symptoms, and 35.7% had an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia. 55.6% required supplemental O(2) and 24.6% had an ICU admission that required either noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. 22.6% (N = 122) of these patients were diagnosed with an RVI, of which 15 were co-infected with two or more respiratory viruses. There were 41 (34%) rhinovirus/enterovirus, 41 (34%) influenza (Types A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2209, and B), 16 (13%) RSV, 15 (12%) coronavirus (Types NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1), 13 (11%) metapneumovirus, and 7 (5%) parainfluenza (Types 2, 3, and 4). 85.2% (104/122) of patients with an RVI received antibiotics. The mean LOS and antibiotic duration were 9.07 days and 7.31 days for patients with an RVI when compared with 11.5 days and 10.4 days for patients without an RVI (P = 0.098; P = 0.032), respectively. In patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures, the mean LOS was 8.4 days and mean antibiotic duration was 5.9 days when compared with 16.4 days and 15.5 days for all patients with positive bacterial cultures (P = 0.003; P \u003C 0.0001), respectively. The mean time from available results of \u002B RP to antibiotic discontinuation was 5.1 days in the setting of negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSION: Although antibiotic exposure and time to discontinuation still remained significant in patients diagnosed with an RVI, there was a marked reduction in LOS and antibiotic duration in the subset of patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures.

Hence, anesthesiologists, armed with a comprehensive understanding of pathophysiology and physiologic effects of liver transplantation on recipients, are expected to maintain homeostasis of all organ function. Specifically, patients with fulminant hepatic failure develop significant changes in cerebral function, and cerebral perfusion is maintained by monitoring cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and intracranial pressure. Hyperdynamic circulation is challenged by the postreperfusion syndrome, which may lead to cardiovascular collapse. The goal of circulatory support is to maintain tissue perfusion via optimal preload, contractility, and heart rate using the guidance of right-heart catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome have high morbidity and mortality, and they should be properly evaluated preoperatively. Major bleeding is a common occurrence, and euvolemia is maintained using a rapid infusion device. Pre-existing coagulopathy is compounded by dilution, fibrinolysis, heparin effect, and excessive activation.

However, as free oligosaccharides are poorly immunogenic and do not induce immunological memory in the most at risk population (infants and young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients), glycoconjugate vaccines containing the same carbohydrate antigen covalently linked to an immunogenic carrier protein have gained a prominent role. Accordingly, a number of glycoconjugate vaccines mostly directed against infections caused by bacterial pathogens have been licensed and are currently available on the market. However, also glycoconjugate vaccines suffer from significant drawbacks. The challenging procedures required for the isolation and purification of the carbohydrate antigen from its natural source often lead to poor homogeneity and presence of biological contaminants, resulting in batch-to-batch variability. Moreover, in some cases, the overwhelming immunogenicity of the carrier protein may induce the carbohydrate epitope suppression, causing hyporesponsiveness. The development of synthetic oligosaccharide-based vaccine candidates, characterized by the presence of pure and well-defined synthetic oligosaccharide structures, is expected to meet the requirement of homogeneous and highly reproducible preparations. In the present chapter, we report on the major advances in the development of synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccines. First of all, we describe different strategies developed during the last years to circumvent the inherent difficulties of classical oligosaccharide synthesis, such as the one-pot glycosylation and the solid-phase synthesis, and their application to the preparation of carbohydrate antigens apt to conjugation with protein carriers. Next, we discuss the most representative methodologies employed for the chemical ligation of oligosaccharide structures to proteins. Finally, in the last section, we report significant examples of fully synthetic vaccines exploiting the multivalency effect. These constructs are based on the concept that the conjugation of multiple copies of synthetic oligosaccharide antigens to multivalent scaffolds, such as dendrimers, (cyclo)peptides, gold nanoparticles, and calixarenes, raises cooperative interactions between carbohydrates and immune receptors, leading to strong enhancement of the saccharide antigen immunogenicity.","publish_time":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cancogni, Damiano; Fusari, Matteo; Poggi, Niccol\u00F2; Lay, Luigi","journal":"Polysaccharides","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/567d2d7b5ac5f8a35c586c7a6f35261592b6999b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthetic vaccines","development of synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccines","well-defined synthetic oligosaccharide structures","development of synthetic oligosaccharide-based vaccine candidates","number of glycoconjugate vaccines","conjugation of multiple copies of synthetic oligosaccharide antigens","immunogenic carrier protein","carbohydrate epitope suppression","preparation of carbohydrate antigens apt","chemical ligation of oligosaccharide structures","carbohydrates","protein carriers","inherent difficulties of classical oligosaccharide synthesis","saccharide antigen immunogenicity","presence of biological contaminants","presence of pure","variety of different biological processes","ideal candidates","overwhelming immunogenicity","vaccine formulation","bacterial pathogens","significant examples","significant drawbacks","different strategies","batch variability","solid-phase synthesis","young children","occurrence","calixarenes","immune receptors","poor homogeneity","strong enhancement","immunocompromised patients","risk population","cooperative interactions","multivalent scaffolds","peptides","infants","malignant cell surface","isolation","natural source","application","gold nanoparticles","cyclo","dendrimers","years","concept","proteins","purification","major advances","infections","pot glycosylation","immunological memory","prominent role","requirement of homogeneous","reproducible preparations","representative methodologies","involvement","hyporesponsiveness","multivalency effect","challenging procedures","free oligosaccharides","cases","section","present chapter","market","constructs"],"language":"en"},

But, there are some limitations too which restrict wider applications of this technology to its full potential. Further refinement of this technology in terms of resolving these shortcomings constitutes one of the thrust areas in present RNAi research.

While the main clinical applications of immunoglobulin therapy concern their use as replacement for patients with primary immunodeficiencies, or as treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, their role in infectious disease is limited largely to viral and toxin neutralization and replacement therapy in patients with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Many aspects of the therapeutic regimen of immunoglobulins even in the established indications remain open. Recently, due to the worldwide surge of immunosuppression caused by AIDS, organ transplantation, cancer, and autoimmune therapies, as well as the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, there has been renewed interest in the use of antibody preparation to prevent infections in high-risk groups. Knowing the limitations of the current anti-infective armamentarium, approaches that target the host through manipulations to augment the host immune response provide a helpful aid to conventional treatment options. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that strategies aiming to support or stimulate immune response could be feasible approaches that would benefit immunocompromised patients.

It was originally thought that interferon could be used as a general anti-viral agent and in anti-cancer therapy. There are many different types of interferons, now known as interferons \u201Calpha,\u201D \u201Cbeta,\u201D \u201Cgamma\u201D and \u201Clambda,\u201D with different cellular receptors and modes of action, and there are possibly 24 different types of alpha interferon. Independently and simultaneously, a group of Japanese scientists found an \u201Cinterfering factor,\u201D which upon subsequent analysis turned out to be interferon, probably of the alpha type. The interferon alpha gene was the first mammalian gene to be cloned in a bacterial system and became the prototype for gene cloning technology. Until the cloning of the interferons in Escherichia coli, and expression of the interferon genes in mammalian cells in culture, it was impossible to obtain enough material for clinical use. Interferon today is predominantly used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C, leukemia and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. As an anti-viral agent, interferon has not lived up to its initial promise, since in vitro most viruses block the activity of interferon and clinical trials have given inconclusive results with severe side effects. Interferon induces hundreds of genes in vivo and in vitro, each interferon producing overlapping and distinct gene profiles. The mechanism of both interferon induction and anti-viral response is complicated and involves the interaction of many regulatory molecules. Interferon is now known to be a component of the large family of cytokines or interleukins.","publish_time":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Milton W.","journal":"Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ffa5b989efed715005089e4747c2f7882037327.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123835.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jean Lindenmann"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interferon genes","interferon induction","interferon alpha gene","activity of interferon","different types of alpha interferon","mammalian gene","anti-viral response","different types of interferons","general anti-viral agent","alpha type","gene cloning technology","anti-cancer therapy","distinct gene profiles","different cellular receptors","clinical trials","mammalian cells","clinical use","hundreds of genes","expression","inconclusive results","leukemia","prototype","culture","interfering factor","Escherichia coli","large family of cytokines","interaction","treatment of hepatitis B","lambda","modes of action","viruses","Alick Isaacs","overlapping","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma","subsequent analysis","group of Japanese scientists","component","interleukins","Jean Lindenmann","effects","material","bacterial system","beta","mechanism","regulatory molecules","initial promise","gamma"],"language":"en"},

Household studies were used as the basis for defining exposure to infection in vaccine studies as early as the 1930s in evaluating the efficacy of pertussis vaccines (Kendrick and Eldering 1939). In addition to evaluating vaccine efficacy, household studies have been used to learn about transmission and natural history of many infections. Aspects of the natural history studied in households include the transmissibility, the incubation and latent periods, the duration of infectiousness, and the serial interval between cases (Hope-Simpson 1952; Bailey 1957). Household studies have also been used to evaluate other interventions, such as post-exposure prophylaxis with influenza antiviral agents (Welliver et al 2001; Hayden et al 2004). Exposure to an infectious case within a household can be used as a natural challenge study, for example, when studying immunological correlates of protection (Storsaeter et al 1998). Longitudinal studies of pneumococcal carriage in households and schools have been used to estimate the acquisition and clearance rates for asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage. The general idea of a transmission unit is that individuals make contact sufficient for transmission within it. Households are the most common form of transmission unit used in studies. It allows easy identification of contacts between a case and susceptibles, and families are convenient units of study. Many other settings are also used as transmission units in studies and analyses that condition on exposure to infection. These include sexual partnerships, classrooms, schools, school buses, airplanes, day care centers, and workplaces, among others. Here we talk mostly about household studies, but many of the study designs and analyses are applicable with possibly slight modification to other transmission units as well. The term household is much easier for exposition than is \u201Ctransmission unit\u201D.","publish_time":"2009-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halloran, M.

In order to protect patients, staff, and facilities it is essential that healthcare facilities be prepared for such emergency events. Ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) and Office Based Anesthesia (OBA) practices are unique healthcare settings that necessitate specific emergency planning since they typically do not have rapid response or code teams on site. In addition, they typically operate with fewer personnel and have staff members who often perform multiple functions. Previously there has been variability in the emergency preparedness amongst ASCs and OBA practices. The Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services (CMS) has recently identified three requirements for maintaining healthcare services during an emergency. These are 1) safeguarding human resources, 2) maintaining business operations, and 3) protecting physical resources. In 2016 CMS issued new rules establishing national emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare and Medicaid participating providers in the United States. In addition there are requirements specifically for ASCs and OBAs. The first step in emergency preparedness is performing a risk assessment for a practice using an \u201Call-hazards\u201D approach. In this approach, the practice attempts to identify all hazards that could potentially affect the practice as well as evaluating the likelihood of such hazards. This risk assessment is then incorporated into an emergency plan for the facility.

Provitamin D (7-dehydrocholesterol) is converted to previtamin D which is further modified by a series of reactions to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This Chapter summarises the discovery of vitamin D and reviews the chemistry and photochemistry of its precursors, transformations and metabolites. The production of vitamin D in various human populations is described, and how to assess vitamin D status. The skeletal and non-skeletal effects of vitamin D are discussed, particularly its role in immunomodulation with consequences for protection against a variety of human diseases. The Chapter concludes with evolutionary aspects, the occurrence and role of vitamin D in the plant kingdom, biogeographical considerations, and the nonphotochemical production of vitamin D in certain plants.","publish_time":"2014-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Norval, Mary; Bj\u00F6rn, Lars Olof","journal":"Photobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f50ce0b3e36148b96421c3c28fb5df73c7266cdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121328.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of vitamin D","discovery of vitamin D","vitamin D status","nonphotochemical production of vitamin D","Provitamin D","previtamin D","non-skeletal effects of vitamin D","human body","various human populations","variety of human diseases","Chapter","protection","biogeographical considerations","plant kingdom","exposure","skin","occurrence","certain plants","rickets","active form","precursors","dihydroxyvitamin","consequences","evolutionary aspects","photochemistry","functions","result","dehydrocholesterol","transformations","series of reactions","wide range","ultraviolet radiation","immunomodulation","metabolites","ability","strict sense"],"language":"en"},

Despite great advances in synthetic organic chemistry, one fourth of present-day drugs have still a botanical origin, and we are currently living a revival of interest in new pharmaceuticals from plant sources. Modern biotechnology has defined the potential of plants to be systems able to manufacture not only molecules naturally occurring in plants but also newly engineered compounds, from small to complex protein molecules, which may originate even from non-plant sources. Among these compounds, pharmaceuticals such as vaccines, antibodies and other therapeutic or prophylactic entities can be listed. For this technology, the term plant molecular farming has been coined with reference to agricultural applications due to the use of crops as biofactories for the production of high-added value molecules. In this perspective, edible plants have also been thought as a tool to deliver by the oral route recombinant compounds of medical significance for new therapeutic strategies. Despite many hurdles in establishing regulatory paths for this \u201Cnovel\u201D biotechnology, plants as bioreactors deserve more attention when considering their intrinsic advantages, such as the quality and safety of the recombinant molecules that can be produced and their potential for large-scale and low-cost production, despite worrying issues (e.g. amplification and diffusion of transgenes) that are mainly addressed by regulations, if not already tackled by the plant-made products already commercialized. The huge benefits generated by these valuable products, synthesized through one of the safest, cheapest and most efficient method, speak for themselves. Milestone for plant-based recombinant protein production for human health use was the approval in 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration of plant-made taliglucerase alfa, a therapeutic enzyme for the treatment of Gaucher\u2019s disease, synthesized in carrot suspension cultures by Protalix BioTherapeutics. In this review, we will go through the various approaches and results for plant-based production of proteins and recent progress in the development of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) for the prevention and treatment of human diseases. An analysis on acceptance of these products by public opinion is also tempted.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massa, Silvia; Presenti, Ombretta; Benvenuto, Eugenio","journal":"Progress in Botany Vol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e0bf7801cc76a9713f9f9eb28eaeffcb335e575.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121380.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121380/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration","Protalix BioTherapeutics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of plant","plant-based production of proteins","non-plant sources","recombinant molecules","potential of plants","Drug Administration of plant","recombinant protein production","edible plants","term plant molecular farming","low-cost production","production of high","engineered compounds","new pharmaceuticals","value molecules","complex protein molecules","therapeutic enzyme","new therapeutic strategies","human health use","valuable products","oral route recombinant compounds of medical significance","rich variety of natural compounds","treatment of human diseases","use of crops","Modern biotechnology","treatment of Gaucher\u2019s disease","recent progress","carrot suspension cultures","taliglucerase alfa","synthetic organic chemistry","US Food","antibodies","novel","approval","quality","prevention","results","present-day drugs","reference","great advances","Protalix BioTherapeutics","acceptance","issues","attention","biofactories","bioreactors","systems able","vaccines","PMPs","regulatory paths","agricultural applications","various approaches","efficient method","amplification","botanical origin","intrinsic advantages","earliest stages of civilization","huge benefits","public opinion","prophylactic entities","safety","Milestone","diffusion of transgenes","hurdles","tool","analysis","perspective","revival","review","regulations"],"language":"en"},

This surprising finding underscores the importance of alternative splicing through which a single gene can generate structurally and functionally distinct protein isoforms [1]. Based on genome-wide analysis, 75% of human genes are thought to encode at least two alternatively spliced isoforms [2, 3]. The regulation of splice site usage provides a versatile mechanism for controlling gene expression and for the generation of proteome diversity, playing essential roles in many biological processes, such as embryonic development, cell growth, and apoptosis. The splice sites are generally recognized by the splicing machinery, a ribonuclear protein complex known as the spliceosome. Spliceosome binding is determined by competing activities of various auxiliary regulatory proteins, such as members of SR protein or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) protein families, which bind specific regulatory sequences and alter the binding of the spliceosome to a particular splice site [1, 4]. Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner [5]. The selection of splice site can be altered by numerous extracellular stimuli such as hormones, immune response, neuronal depolarization, and cellular stress, through changes in synthesis/degradation, complex formation, and intracellular localization of regulatory proteins. SR proteins are heavily phosphorylated in cells and involved in constitutive and alternative splicing, and the phosphorylation states of SR proteins are altered in response to these extracellular stimuli [6]. Splicing mutations located in either intronic or exonic regions frequently cause hereditary diseases, and more than 15% of mutations that cause genetic disease affect pre-mRNA splicing [7]. Based on a hypothetical idea that we can cure human diseases by regulating the phosphorylation state of SR proteins with synthetic inhibitors of protein kinases, we started our long voyage to challenge the development of new chemical therapeutics.","publish_time":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hagiwara, Masatoshi","journal":"Chembiomolecular Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f760e0454b37864b2d4e5a5552efe0486b3b92b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Splicing mutations","splicing machinery","members of SR protein","Pre-mRNA splicing","protein families","phosphorylation state of SR proteins","phosphorylation states of SR proteins","importance of alternative splicing","ribonuclear protein complex","distinct protein isoforms","particular splice site","selection of splice site","intracellular localization of regulatory proteins","Spliceosome binding","splice sites","specific regulatory sequences","regulation of splice site usage","activities of various auxiliary regulatory proteins","synthetic inhibitors of protein kinases","tissue-specific","human diseases","human genes","numerous extracellular stimuli","complex formation","embryonic development","immune response","developmental stage-specific manner","gene expression","hereditary diseases","single gene","spliced isoforms","genome sequence analyses","genome-wide analysis","limited number of genes","development of new chemical therapeutics","heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein","hormones","synthesis","neuronal depolarization","hnRNP","versatile mechanism","essential roles","cellular stress","high degree of proteomic complexity","biological processes","changes","degradation","intronic","cells","genetic disease","generation of proteome diversity","exonic regions","cell growth","long voyage","surprising finding","apoptosis","hypothetical idea"],"language":"en"},

OGG1 excises 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-dG) lesion on DNA that is often induced by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been linked to mutations, cancer development, and tissue damage. Most, if not all, environmental toxic agents and mammalian cellular metabolites elicit the generation of ROS, either directly, indirectly, or both, which is among the first cellular responses. ROS in combination with other oxidative molecules/moieties are recognized as a major factor for killing invading pathogens but meanwhile can cause tissue damage. ROS potentially modify proteins, lipids, and DNA due to the strong molecular reactivity. While oxidative stress causes increased levels of all types of oxidatively modified DNA bases, accumulation of 8-oxo-dG in the DNA has been singled out to be a main culprit linking to various inflammatory disease processes. Oxidatively damaged DNA bases such as 8-oxo-dG are primarily repaired by the base excision repair (BER) mechanism, in which OGG1, as the lesion recognition enzyme, plays a fundamental role in fixing this DNA damage. In this chapter, we summarize the roles and potential mechanistic analyses of OGG1 in lung infection and other inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Ping; Pu, Qinqin; Qin, Shugang; Schettler, Jacob; Thoemke, Mariah; Li, Guoping; Jiang, Jianxin; Wu, Min","journal":"Oxidative Stress in Lung Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48906d4feb8016d893ef34ea2237cede4df1c845.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121726.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121726/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA damage","xoguanine DNA glycosylase","Oxidatively damaged DNA bases","generation of ROS","underlying mechanisms of DNA repair enzyme","types of oxidatively modified DNA bases","OGG1 excises","inflammatory diseases","tissue damage","lung infection","potential mechanistic analyses of OGG1","lesion recognition enzyme","pathogenesis of inflammatory response","functional roles","various inflammatory disease processes","oxidative stress","oxidative molecules","cellular responses","mammalian cellular metabolites","base excision repair","generation of reactive oxygen species","increased levels","fundamental role","moieties","environmental toxic agents","BER","accumulation of","extensive research","main culprit","invading pathogens","major factor","cancer development","combination","decades","mutations","strong molecular reactivity","dihydroguanine","proteins","lipids","chapter"],"language":"en"},

To address this difficult scientific problem, we need to understand how transformations in social-ecological systems caused by multifaceted interactions with anthropogenic environmental changes such as urbanization, agricultural transformations, and natural habitat alterations, produce feedbacks that affect natural communities and ultimately their pathogens, animal host, and human populations. Focusing on the complex interactions among natural and human systems at diverse spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, we describe the development of a framework for analyzing social-ecological models, to understand how these systems function and the processes through which these systems interact with each other to influence disease outbreaks. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, we draw upon multiple social science theories and methods (e.g., environmental economics, geography, decision and risk science, urban and regional development, and spatial information science). We posit that the framework helps to identify potential vulnerabilities of CNH systems to disturbances, describing important elements as a starting point for the development and testing of more general CNH systems. We also posit that transformations in the elements and how they relate to each other are key in determining the robustness of CNH systems. Given the importance and difficulty of research on social-ecological systems, we recommend a carefully considered theoretical rationale and a model-guided methodological approach. We conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as EID and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Integrated approaches are arguably the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem.","publish_time":"2014-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finucane, Melissa L.; Fox, Jefferson; Saksena, Sumeet; Spencer, James H.","journal":"Understanding Society and Natural Resources","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e2cd7e28ec3b6989a25bfe9093e62efcbc88242.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human systems","social-ecological systems","systems function","general CNH systems","robustness of CNH systems","potential vulnerabilities of CNH systems","complex interactions","framework","complex problem","social-ecological models","natural communities","complex phenomena","multiple social science theories","regional development","natural habitat alterations","risk science","multifaceted interactions","spatial information science","EID","human populations","agricultural transformations","disease outbreaks","environmental economics","important elements","anthropogenic environmental changes","difficult scientific problem","decision","methods","urbanization","temporal","disturbances","testing","in-depth description","best way","infectious diseases","geography","starting point","relationships","pathogens","feedbacks","animal host","organizational scales","difficulty of research","analysis","factors","Unraveling mechanisms","Integrated approaches","single theory","multi-scale issues","importance","processes","theoretical rationale","methodological approach","key"],"language":"en"},

Label-free detection of different bioanalytes such as enzymes, viruses, microorganisms, and blood groups through mass-sensitive transducers has gained considerable importance in the development of modern biosensors. Analyte molecules interact with the surface of sensitive layer coated on these devices and as a result of this interaction, the frequency change is determined, which provides quantitative information about the mass of analyte. One of the most vital elements of these detection systems is to design selective sensor coatings through control surface structuring at nanoscale. Molecular imprinting has proven to be a highly suitable technique to generate selective surfaces that are capable of detecting different analytes, quantitatively and qualitatively as well. The tailor-made synthetic antibody cavities are rigid and stable, which are not immediately collapsed upon analyte interaction; moreover, the different bioanalytes do not undergo any phase change and maintain their original identity during analysis.

How to produce an optimal decision rule on the basis of the data given, which typically consists of test results for patients with or without confirmed health condition. To address questions of this kind, we develop an approach that combines (semi-supervised) machine learning methodology with concepts from (cooperative) game theory. Roughly speaking, while the former is responsible for optimally combining single tests into decision rules, the latter is used to judge the influence and importance of individual tests as well as the interaction between them. Our approach is motivated and illustrated by a concrete case study in veterinary medicine, namely the diagnosis of a disease in cats called feline infectious peritonitis.","publish_time":"2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfannschmidt, Karlson; H\u00FCllermeier, Eyke; Held, Susanne; Neiger, Reto","journal":"Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77e23cfd444a7be96166e97272909ae1f08c5e5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121901.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single tests","subset of tests","different tests","effectiveness of individual tests","importance of individual tests","optimal decision rule","decision rules","overall decision rule","approach","health state","medical diagnosis","health condition","test results","important questions","concepts","machine learning methodology","cooperative","disease","cats","veterinary medicine","concrete case study","feline infectious peritonitis","patients","information","basis","synergies","game theory","influence","account","redundancies","data","kind","interaction","example","cost"],"language":"en"},

The RAS counter-regulatory axis composed by the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and Mas receptor mediates pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic processes, frequently opposing the classical RAS arm (ACE-Ang II-AT(1) receptor) actions. Therefore, the balance between both RAS axes most likely affects the clinical and histopathological expression of liver diseases. It is worth noticing that liver diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Without proper treatment, all types of chronic hepatitis will progress to end-stage liver diseases, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which ultimately lead to death. In this context, to better comprehend the role of RAS components in liver failure might pave the way for the search of potential predictive biomarkers as well as the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Valuable data have been generated from preclinical and clinical studies.

It is generally accepted that pancytopenia results predominantly from the increased phagocytosis and destruction of hemocytes in splenic macrophages. In addition, liver fibrosis is amplified by migrated Th2 lymphocytes and transforming growth factor beta from the spleen. There is a possibility that increase of the spleen stiffness is the primary factor of idiopathic portal hypertension. Spleen stiffness is caused by bleeding, fibrosis, and calcareous deposits after increase in red pulp pressure due to venous congestion. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, macrophage activity in the spleen is upregulated. In addition, high levels of inflammatory cytokines are produced and T cell shows increased proliferation in the spleen. In autoimmune hepatitis model, CD4(\u002B) T cells are differentiated into follicular helper T cells (T(FH)) in the spleen. T(FH) cells promoted hypergammaglobulinemia and antinuclear antibodies production. T(FH) cells migrate from the spleen to the liver, triggering induction of autoimmune hepatitis in this model.

Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages play an important role in defence. However, ingenious pathogen survival mechanisms including phagolysosome destruction enable their persistence. Microbial biofilms present additional challenges. Low intracellular drug concentrations, drug efflux by efflux pumps and/or enzymatic degradation, emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR), are serious limitations of conventional therapy. Targeted delivery using nanocarriers, and passive and active targeting strategies could provide quantum increase in intracellular drug concentration. Receptor mediated endocytosis using appropriate ligands is a viable approach. Liposomes and polymeric/lipidic nanoparticles, dendrimers micelles and micro/nanoemulsions could all be relied upon. Specialised targeting approaches are demonstrated for important diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and Malaria.

Such vaccines can offer improvements in speed, safety and manufacturing process but an inevitable consequence of their high degree of purification is that immunogenicity is reduced through the lack of the innate triggering molecules present in more complex preparations. Targeting recombinant vaccines to antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells however can improve immunogenicity by ensuring that antigen processing is as efficient as possible. Immune complexes, one of a number of routes of APC targeting, are mimicked by a recombinant approach, crystallizable fragment (Fc) fusion proteins, in which the target immunogen is linked directly to an antibody effector domain capable of interaction with receptors, FcR, on the APC cell surface. A number of virus Fc fusion proteins have been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and shown to be efficiently produced and purified. Their use for immunization next to non-Fc tagged equivalents shows that they are powerfully immunogenic in the absence of added adjuvant and that immune stimulation is the result of the Fc-FcR interaction.","publish_time":"2012-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loureiro, Silvia; Robinson, Elena; Chen, Hongying; Phapugrangkul, Pongsathon; Colaco, Camilo; Jones, Ian M","journal":"Innovation in Vaccinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82d639734905dfe9e2442b3df17e5e8ca00b9bc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122206.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant vaccines","recombinant antigen","Traditional vaccines","defined vaccines","Fc-FcR interaction","non-Fc","live attenuated vaccines","number of virus Fc fusion proteins","insect cells","dendritic cells","immunogenicity","antigen processing","recombinant approach","immune stimulation","number of routes","Immune complexes","APC cell surface","antibody effector domain capable of interaction","inevitable consequence","receptors","innate triggering molecules present","crystallizable fragment","manufacturing process","safety","lack","speed","result","APCs","absence of added adjuvant","high degree of purification","complex preparations","baculovirus expression system","immunization","equivalents","improvements","way","target immunogen","use","neutralizing epitopes"],"language":"en"},

By keeping people and communities at the centre of an EWS from the beginning, the EWS can contribute to daily life and livelihoods, thereby supporting wider disaster risk reduction and sustainable development endeavours, rather than being a separate system waiting to be triggered only when a hazard appears.

Mediator release may occur via cross-linking of cell-bound IgE by di-(multi-) valent free drug. Physiological and pharmacological effects of histamine are mediated through four receptors, H(1), H(2), H(3), and H(4.) The H(3) receptor has a regulatory role in the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine; the H(4) receptor exerts a chemotactic effect on several cell types associated with allergy and asthma. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and PAF are powerful mediators of anaphylaxis, asthma, and shock. Sphingosine-1-phosphate, elevated in the lungs of asthmatics, regulates pulmonary epithelium permeability and contributes to the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis. Urticaria is a heterogeneous disease with many subtypes. Both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may cause angioedema. Abacavir changes the shape of the HLA antigen-binding cleft producing an alteration in the repertoire of self-peptides that bind HLA-B*57:01 and a T cell response to self-proteins. Drug-induced delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B CD3\u002B T cells in the dermis and epidermis.

Viral hepatitis B (HBV) affects an estimated 360 million people, whereas hepatitis C affects 123 million people worldwide, and last but not least, at current, India has an HIV/AIDS population of approximately 2.4 million people and more than 30 million in whole world and now it has become a reason for 1.8 million death globally; thus, millions of people still struggle for their lives. The progress in medical science has made it possible in overcoming the various fatal diseases such as small pox, chicken pox, dengue, etc., but human immunodeficiency viruses, influenza, and hepatitis virus have renewed challenge surprisingly. The obstacles and challenges in therapy include existence of antibiotic resistance strains of common organisms due to overuse of antibiotics, lack of vaccines, adverse drug reaction, and last but not least the susceptibility concerns. Emergence of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics has shown some promises to take challenges. The discovery of human genome project has opened new vistas to understand the behaviors of genetic makeup in development and progression of diseases and treatment in various viral diseases. Current and previous decade have been engaged in making repositories of polymorphisms (SNPs) of various genes including drug-metabolizing enzymes, receptors, inflammatory cells related with immunity, and antigen-presenting cells, along with the prediction of risks. The genetic makeup alone is most likely an adequate way to handle the therapeutic decision-making process for previous regimen failure. With the introduction of new antiviral therapeutic agents, a significant improvement in progression and overall survival has been achieved, but these drugs have shown several adverse responses in some individuals, so the success is not up to the expectations. Research and acquisition of new knowledge of pharmacogenomics may help in overcoming the prevailing burden of viral diseases. So it will definitely help in selecting the most effective therapeutic agents, effective doses, and drug response for the individuals. Thus, it will be able to transform the laboratory research into the clinical bench side and will also help in understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases with drug action, so the patients will be managed more properly and finally become able to fulfill the promise of the future.","publish_time":"2013-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dwivedi, Shailendra; Yadav, Suraj Singh; Singh, Manish Kumar; Shukla, Shailja; Khattri, Sanjay; Pant, Kamlesh Kumar","journal":"Omics for Personalized Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03f66e024d4c560bc03d460ad8042344b670ac9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120516.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120516/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["various viral diseases","progression of diseases","pathogenesis of viral diseases","various fatal diseases","Viral hepatitis B","prevailing burden of viral diseases","hepatitis virus","drug action","drug response","hepatitis C","millions of people","effective therapeutic agents","adverse drug reaction","drug-metabolizing enzymes","various genes","introduction of new antiviral therapeutic agents","new vistas","challenges","individuals","current","acquisition of new knowledge of pharmacogenomics","therapeutic decision-making process","behaviors of genetic makeup","small pox","chicken pox","effective doses","inflammatory cells","laboratory research","adverse responses","previous decade","AIDS population","Emergence of pharmacogenomics","human immunodeficiency viruses","previous regimen failure","discovery of human genome project","significant improvement","existence of antibiotic resistance strains of common organisms","overuse of antibiotics","therapy","lack of vaccines","receptors","dengue","influenza","development","treatment","immunity","SNPs","overall survival","India","HIV","adequate way","HBV","leading cause of deaths","repositories of polymorphisms","renewed challenge","medical science","pharmacogenetics","clinical bench","obstacles","promises","antigen","success","developing countries","drugs","patients","prediction of risks","susceptibility concerns","reason","future","expectations","lives","world"],"language":"en"},

The introduction of closed-tube systems as well as lab-on-a-chip devices further resulted in a higher automation degree with a reduced contamination risk. These applications complement or even stepwise replace classical methods in clinical microbiology like virus cultures, resistance determination, microscopic and metabolic analyses, as well as biochemical or immunohistochemical assays. In addition, novel diagnostic markers appear, like noncoding RNAs and miRNAs providing additional room for novel biomarkers. This article provides an overview of microarrays as diagnostics devices and research tools. Introduced in 1995 for transcription analysis, microarrays are used today to detect several different biomolecules like DNA, RNA, miRNA, and proteins among others. Mainly used in research, some microarrays also found their way to clinical diagnostics.

A review of studies indicates that climate change is unlikely to have much impact on agriculture and forestry; projected climate change will increase productivity in some regions while reducing it in others, leading to a redistribution of land rents with little impact on overall output. When CO(2) fertilization is taken into account, there might even be an overall increase in primary sector productivity that results in more undisturbed land, thus protecting biodiversity. Other findings in this chapter also run counter to current shibboleths: The biggest threat to polar bears is hunting, not climate change; current trends in Arctic ice extent are not without historical precedent; sea level rise is not an imminent threat; extreme weather events are not increasing; malaria is not only a tropical disease; and human health is a function of income, not climate, with bottom-up models using UN data predicting that death rates from almost all causes will be lower with projected global warming than without it. Meanwhile, integrated assessment models (IAMs) simply assume damages are an arbitrary function of temperature; upon balancing discounted costs and benefits, IAMs can be used to find an optimal path (usually of a carbon tax or emissions cap) for mitigating climate change. It is shown that different assumptions regarding damages, the discount rate, and/or the probability of catastrophic damage can be used to justify completely different policies for addressing global warming. Therefore, a carbon tax that is contingent on the temperature in the troposphere above the tropics \u2013 where the earliest indication of global warming is predicted to occur \u2013 is considered to be the preferred policy strategy as it should appeal to global warming proponents and skeptics alike. Finally, the Kaya identity is used to demonstrate the policy dilemma that decision makers face in reducing CO(2) emissions.","publish_time":"2012-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Kooten, G.

It was first recommended for the treatment of gout by Alexander of Tralles in the sixth century AD. Later it has been employed for suggested and approved indications including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), alcohol induced hepatitis, psoriasis, Beh\u00E7et disease, Sweet syndrome, scleroderma, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Perhaps the most effective results have been obtained in the prophylaxis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Colchicine is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum and is trapped in the body tissues. It is metabolized in the liver and the intestine by cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PGY) 1. Colchicine is excreted mainly by the biliary system, intestines and the kidneys. It has a narrow therapeutic range, but with normal liver and kidney functions is relatively safe and can be used during pregnancy, nursing and in infants. The main mechanism of action of colchicine is probably through interaction with microtubules affecting leukocyte chemotaxis, thereby suppressing inflammation. The blood level of colchicine may be affected by concomitant drug administration and therefore, caution should be exercised when such medications are added.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ben-Chetrit, Eldad","journal":"Textbook of Autoinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e61ca298ffbfb570c555627f4dcac7c2a6029f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120738.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120738/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Colchicum"],"locations":["Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["blood level of colchicine","normal liver","cytochrome P","biliary system","P-glycoprotein","active ingredient","primary biliary cirrhosis","active pharmacological component","Sweet syndrome","Beh\u00E7et disease","scleroderma","psoriasis","PBC","alcohol","3A4","plant","Colchicum autumnale","hepatitis","CYP","interaction","approved indications","prophylaxis of familial Mediterranean fever","Alexander of Tralles","caution","leukocyte chemotaxis","FMF","bulbs","meadow saffron","sarcoidosis","kidney functions","microtubules","narrow therapeutic range","concomitant drug administration","main mechanism of action","pregnancy","hexameric rings termed","treatment of gout","amyloidosis","intestines","kidneys","PGY","ileum","nursing","infants","century","inflammation","jejunum","alkaloid","body tissues","effective results","medications"],"language":"en"},

These pathogens have devised evolved environmental adaptations, including the possession of genomic resistance mutations. Haemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses and respiratory pathogens like the avian and human influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, most from zoonotic reservoirs, may significantly increase morbidity and mortality in the human population in the nearest future. Likewise, vector-borne zoonotic viral diseases including Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile, transmitted by arthropods from animal reservoirs, occur frequently in the tropics, exhibiting previously unseen patterns of infection and spread. These patterns are facilitated by many intrinsic factors like mutated sites in the viral genome, and external factors including urbanization, displacement, human migration and climate change. Emerging viruses can easily cross boundaries and pose severe threats to the human populations in new geographical areas. Here, we outline the features of common emergent viruses and factors facilitating their emergence, effects, control and sustained management in the environment.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shenge, Juliet Adamma; Opayele, Adewale Victor","journal":"Current Microbiological Research in Africa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3c34a0a9ad48f9bddc58ecc480e4cb94d0afa09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley"],"locations":["Africa","Middle East","West Nile"],"keyphrases":["Emerging viruses","Lassa fever viruses","Haemorrhagic fever viruses","yellow fever","human populations","respiratory pathogens","human migration","features of common emergent viruses","human influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome","Rift Valley fever","external factors","zoonotic viral diseases","viral genome","intrinsic factors","Emerging viral infections","zoonotic reservoirs","Middle East respiratory syndrome","public health implications","severe threats","animal reservoirs","unseen patterns of infection","re-emergent variants of existing ones","SARS","Marburg","displacement","dengue","Ebola","urbanization","EVI","emergence","MERS","growing threat","control","West Nile","effects","chikungunya","mutated sites","morbidity","cross boundaries","sustained management","evolved environmental adaptations","new geographical areas","possession of genomic resistance mutations","Africa","arthropods","climate change","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

Given its implication in immune homeostasis and immune surveillance combined with the fact that various lineages of malignant cells exhibit loss-of-function mutations, CD95 was initially classified as a tumor suppressor gene.

This gap can be addressed by estimating airport catchment areas. This research aims to determine how existing market area delineation techniques estimate airport catchments differently, and which techniques are best suited to anticipate where infectious diseases may spread. Multiple techniques were tested for airports in the Province of Ontario, Canada: circular buffers, drive-time buffers, Thiessen polygons, and the Huff model, with multiple variations tested for some techniques. The results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively based on spatial patterns as well as area and population of each catchment area. There were notable differences, specifically between deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Deterministic techniques may only be suitable if all airports in a study area are similar in terms of attractiveness. The probabilistic Huff model appeared to produce more realistic results because it accounted for variation in airport attractiveness. Additionally, the Huff model requires few inputs and therefore would be efficient to execute in situations where time, resources, and data are limited.","publish_time":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huber, Carmen; Rinner, Claus","journal":"Geospatial Technologies for Local and Regional Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b466b027fb201fbb4851c0000ffb3cc85820e324.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Huff"],"organizations":["Air"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Deterministic techniques","Multiple techniques","study area","airports","airport attractiveness","unexplored area of research","probabilistic Huff model","existing market area delineation techniques","airport catchments","airport catchment areas","volume of travel","global air travel data","international spread of infectious disease","drive-time buffers","circular buffers","infectious diseases","multiple variations","terms of attractiveness","infected passenger","realistic results","probabilistic approaches","infected individual","Thiessen polygons","Canada","public health practice","Province of Ontario","population","situations","resources","inputs","notable differences","spatial patterns","gap"],"language":"en"},

Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea, thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use\u2014chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties.

Using these host\u2013pathogen interactions to their advantage, pathogens attach, invade, disseminate, and evade host defense mechanisms to promote their survival in the hostile host environment. Many viruses, bacteria, and parasites express adhesins that bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to facilitate their initial attachment and subsequent cellular entry. Some pathogens also secrete virulence factors that modify HSPG expression. HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed on the cell surface of adherent cells and in the extracellular matrix. HSPGs are composed of one or several heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains attached covalently to specific core proteins. For most intracellular pathogens, cell surface HSPGs serve as a scaffold that facilitates the interaction of microbes with secondary receptors that mediate host cell entry. Consistent with this mechanism, addition of HS or its pharmaceutical functional mimic, heparin, inhibits microbial attachment and entry into cultured host cells, and HS-binding pathogens can no longer attach or enter cultured host cells whose HS expression has been reduced by enzymatic treatment or chemical mutagenesis. In pathogens where the specific HS adhesin has been identified, mutant strains lacking HS adhesins are viable and show normal growth rates, suggesting that the capacity to interact with HSPGs is strictly a virulence activity. The goal of this chapter is to provide a mechanistic overview of our current understanding of how certain microbial pathogens subvert HSPGs to promote their infection, using specific HSPG\u2013pathogen interactions as representative examples.","publish_time":"2011-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartlett, Allison H.; Park, Pyong Woo","journal":"Glycans in Diseases and Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8265802ea1d7844ea39c53f73e51dc3213440533.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSPG","HS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cell entry","HS-binding pathogens","cell surface HSPGs","HS adhesins","HS expression","cultured host cells","host components","intracellular pathogens","certain microbial pathogens","addition of HS","specific HS adhesin","host defense mechanisms","hostile host environment","cell surface of adherent cells","microbial attachment","specific HSPG","cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans","pathogen interactions","HSPG expression","virulence factors","subsequent cellular entry","specific core proteins","initial attachment","multitude of factors","virulence activity","parasites express adhesins","glycosaminoglycan chains","current understanding","heparin","survival","secondary receptors","pharmaceutical functional mimic","mutant strains","scaffold","normal growth rates","interaction of microbes","enzymatic treatment","representative examples","mechanistic overview","bacteria","advantage","chapter","chemical mutagenesis","viruses","extracellular matrix","capacity","infections","goal"],"language":"en"},

Subsequent global expansion of dengue infection outbreaks has occurred, with millions of cases yearly, probably from a combination of factors including proliferation of international travel and trade, possibly global climate changes, adaptation of the vectors to new environment, and emergence of a new mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus. Chikungunya virus, also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causes a very similar clinical disease but with more prominent arthralgia or arthritis and was originally described in Africa in the 1960s. After a quiescent period of several decades, it reemerged in Africa in 2004 and rapidly spread across the Indian Ocean to involve Asian countries and parts of Europe. However, the past 2 years have seen the emergence of chikungunya virus in the western hemisphere with major outbreaks in the Caribbean and the Americas. Similar to dengue virus, chikungunya virus has adapted to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes which can transmit the disease. Although dengue infection is a more deadly disease especially in young children, chikungunya infection can cause prolonged severe disability and occasionally rare fatalities from encephalitis. No specific treatment is available for either diseases, but development of an effective vaccine for dengue infection is in progress. Until 2007, Zika virus [also transmitted by Aedes species] was associated with only sporadic mild infections in Africa and Asia. In 2007, Zika virus for the first time caused an outbreak beyond Africa and Asia to the Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then Zika virus has spread to French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, and Easter Island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean [Chile] in 2014 and by 2015 to Brazil. By January 2016, it became evident that Zika virus had caused an explosive outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean with over 30 countries affected. On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika outbreak a global public health emergency. Zika virus infection is most commonly asymptomatic, and 20% of patients may develop a mild viral disease, but of major concern is the reported association of microcephaly in infected pregnant women in Brazil. This chapter explores the history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, treatment, and prevention of these rapidly emerging zoonoses.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fong, I.

The end of the twentieth century saw increased momentum to reframe infectious diseases from purely health issues to those of security concern. HIV/AIDS, SARS, bird flu, and swine flu pandemics in the twenty-first century have challenged nation-states and international institutions. Added to this challenge are the developments and breakthroughs in scientific experiments. While such progress has the potential to eradicate disease and improve human well-being, it also has the potential to present new risks and possible threats to society if the knowledge is used inappropriately. Biological dual-use research can inherently have both beneficial and dangerous consequences. Several incidents have highlighted the potential dangers associated with scientific experiments such as the accidental creation of the highly virulent mousepox, the reconstruction of the 1918 influenza virus, and the manipulation of the H5N1 bird flu virus. Almost all items necessary to produce lethal biological agents are dual-use and can be readily found in pharmaceutical laboratories. The ability to obtain a pathogen, weaponise the agent, and employ or disperse it, needs to be considered in terms of capability and intent and the increasing franchisation of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda. The availability of open-source information and material, developments in biotechnology sciences, and inexpensive equipment make the production of bioweapons an attractive option for non-state actors. For example, in recent times individuals and non-state actors have developed or obtained ricin and anthrax with the intention of using it for either personal or political harm. Biological agents are not constrained by sovereign borders and can have a devastating effect either in the form of an infectious disease pandemic or as a result of scientific experimentation. This chapter analyses key issues and problems associated with biological security issues and dual-use research including governance arrangements to address those concerns.","publish_time":"2016-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, Rita","journal":"Global Insecurity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/961458c62b1ac196cf312994ff02e5edbd6a1c6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122325.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Al Qaeda"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Biological risks","biological security issues","lethal biological agents","scientific experiments","non-state actors","century","developments","health issues","key issues","H5N1 bird flu virus","research","potential dangers","swine flu pandemics","infectious disease pandemic","result of scientific experimentation","infectious diseases","possible threats","new risks","security concern","influenza virus","material","production of bioweapons","recent times individuals","attractive option","manipulation","problems","increasing franchisation of terrorist groups","inexpensive equipment","source information","biotechnology sciences","society","accidental creation","SARS","increased momentum","virulent mousepox","reconstruction","ricin","sovereign borders","governance arrangements","AIDS","items necessary","breakthroughs","devastating effect","Al Qaeda","availability of open","pathogen","weaponise","intention","terms of capability","example","nation-states","international institutions","HIV","knowledge","chapter","forms","human well-being","political harm","dangerous consequences","anthrax","concerns","challenge","end","incidents","progress","globalisation of insecurity","pharmaceutical laboratories"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, it is not feasible to conduct certain research in humans because of ethical constraints, yet investigators may still be interested in the physiological response in human tissues; in vitro characterization of human tissue is an acceptable choice. Tissue culture techniques have been utilized extensively to investigate questions pertaining to physiology and disease. The isolation and propagation of human epithelial cells has allowed investigators to begin to characterize the interactions and reactions that occur in response to various stimuli. Moreover, the culture of other human tissue has allowed researchers to investigate pathological cascades as well as other physiological responses. Combining cultured endothelial cells and leukocytes together in vitro under laminar flow conditions has helped elucidate the critical interactions that occur in rolling and emigration of leukocytes during the inflammatory response.

Two different viruses, 229E and OC43 were initially recognized. Because of difficulty in isolating them using standard techniques, many of the early studies of their occurrence were seroepidemiologic. They were confirmed to be worldwide in distribution, and, in the North Temperate Zone, mainly occurring in the winter season. With the development of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, two additional distinct viruses have been identified, HKU1 and NL63. The four viruses have now been recognized as important in the etiology of common respiratory infections, second only to the rhinoviruses. In 2002, a previously unrecognized betacoronavirus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir in Southern China and spread during the following year to several major cities of the world. The resulting illness was termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) because of its potential lethality. More than 8,000 probable cases were reported during 2003, mainly from Hong Kong and mainland China, producing social and economic disruption in those areas affected. A constant feature of the outbreak was the importance of nosocomial spread. In spite of an estimated basic reproductive number higher than influenza, the outbreak was ended, in large part because of control of in-hospital transmission. In 2012, another betacoronavirus has emerged in the Arabian peninsula which is producing a somewhat similar illness, termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also marked by extensive nosocomial transmission. The outcome of this emergence is currently unknown.","publish_time":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monto, Arnold S.; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Peiris, J. S.

It is \u223C30,000 bases or 2\u20133 times larger than the genomes of most other RNA viruses. Coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales, the other three families being the Arteriviridae, Toroviridae and Roniviridae. (For a review of classification and evolutionary relatedness of Nidovirales see Gorbalenya et al. 2006.) This grouping is based on the arrangement and relatedness of open reading frames within their genomes and on the presence in infected cells of multiple subgenomic mRNAs that form a 3\u0027-co-terminal, nested set with the genome. Among the Nidovirales, coronaviruses (and toroviruses) are unique in their possession of a helical nucleocapsid, which is unusual for plus-stranded but not minus-stranded RNA viruses; plus-stranded RNA-containing plant viruses in the Closteroviridae and in the Tobamovirus genus also possess helical capsids. Coronaviruses are very successful and have infected many species of animals, including bats, birds (poultry) and mammals, such as humans and livestock. Coronavirus species are classified into three groups, which were based originally on cross-reacting antibodies and more recently on nucleotide sequence relatedness (Gonzalez et al. 2003).

In end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation provides benefits compared with dialysis in terms of improved patient survival better quality of life, and lower ongoing costs after the first year. Living donor kidney transplantation has an advantage with improved allograft survival, and performed earlier and electively compared with deceased donor transplantation. However sensitized patients are increasing in number on transplant waiting lists, and their prospect of getting a transplant is less than nonsensitized patients due to immunological incompatibility with the donor. Strategy for sensitized patients are listing for a compatible deceased donor transplant or, if they have a living donor, either selecting a kidney exchange program or undergoing a desensitization procedure. Desensitization procedures may be undertaken to increase access to either living or deceased donor transplants, and in some situations may also be employed to facilitate participation in a kidney exchange, in less immunological barrier to be overcome. The question of whether individuals are better off with a desensitization treatment followed by HLA-incompatible living donor transplantation or waiting on the deceased donor kidney transplant list for a compatible transplant has recently been addressed by two large multicenter studies, with conflicting results. A multicenter study from the United States published in the New England Journal of Medicine [365;318 326.2011] concluded that there was a strong survival benefit for sensitized patients undergoing desensitization followed by HLA-incompatible living donor kidney transplant compared with those remaining on the waiting list. Of interest, a second study, published in the Lancet, [389;727 734.2017] found no significant survival advantage for desensitized patients compared with similar patients remaining on the waiting list in the United Kingdom. Controversies still remain regarding how desensitization can be achieved and which techniques are effective and safe. In this chapter various complications from the desensitization will be dealt with in current use of medications or armamentum.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Duck Jong","journal":"Kidney Transplantation in Sensitized Patients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b626664dbce59f0c73d60ae5b312edcb7288c554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["donor kidney transplantation","deceased donor transplantation","deceased donor kidney transplant list","compatible deceased donor transplant","HLA-incompatible living donor kidney transplant","deceased donor transplants","HLA-incompatible living donor transplantation","successful kidney transplantation","compatible transplant","desensitized patients","similar patients","nonsensitized patients","desensitization treatment","Desensitization procedures","waiting list","kidney exchange program","improved allograft survival","significant survival advantage","strong survival benefit","multicenter study","terms of improved patient survival better quality of life","United States","United Kingdom","immunological incompatibility","immunological barrier","large multicenter studies","dialysis","benefits","end-stage renal disease","lower ongoing costs","major clinical challenges","New England Journal of Medicine","human leukocyte antigens","HLAs","conflicting results","number","current use of medications","armamentum","year","techniques","chapter various complications","individuals","lists","access","prospect","situations","participation","Strategy","question","Lancet","Controversies"],"language":"en"},

Since the first clinical islet transplantation was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1974 [1], the results have been far from ideal for more than two decades in spite of an improvement of islet isolation technique by Ricordi et al. [2\u20134]. The introduction of the Edmonton protocol, with a highly improved rate of insulin independency, encouraged us to promote clinical islet transplantation [5, 6]. In Japan, we organized the Working Group (The Japanese Islet Transplant Registry) in 1997 under the Japanese Society for Pancreas and Islet Transplantation for the purpose of starting clinical islet transplantation. The first issue of the Working Group was to construct a system of clinical islet transplantation in Japan including the registration of the recipients, procurement of the pancreas for islet isolation and transplantation of the isolated islets. In Japan, afterwards, various problems facing to a start of clinical islet transplantation have been discussed and we completed the guideline for clinical islet transplantation in Japan. The Japanese Organ Transplant Law was enforced in 1997 and organ transplantations using brain dead (DBD) donors were finally started. Since the islet transplantation was not included in the Japanese Organ Transplant Law because it was categorized as tissue transplantation, we were able to use the pancreas only from DCD donors for islet transplantation. The first islet isolation from the human pancreas was performed in 2003.9 and the first islet transplantation was performed in 2004.4 [7\u20139]. Sixty-five islet isolations and 34 islet transplantations were performed in our country from 2003.9.12 to 2007.3.11 [10]. In this chapter, we describe the current status of clinical islet transplantation using DCD donors in Japan.","publish_time":"2013-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kenmochi, Takashi; Asano, Takehide; Akutsu, Naotake; Ito, Taihei","journal":"Marginal Donors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47760eeb86548a0dc94391177b1ca06bfa5f6399.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Minnesota","DCD"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["Pancreatic islet transplantation","islet transplantations","system of clinical islet transplantation","start of clinical islet transplantation","islet isolations","current status of clinical islet transplantation","tissue transplantation","Japanese Islet Transplant Registry","improvement of islet isolation technique","Japanese Organ Transplant Law","DCD donors","Japanese Society","human pancreas","organ transplantations","Working Group","purpose","treatment of type","brain dead","DBD","procurement","registration","invasive procedure","improved rate of insulin independency","recipients","spite","Ricordi","potential","guideline","Edmonton protocol","various problems","isolated islets","diabetes mellitus","decades","introduction","chapter","University of Minnesota","country","results"],"language":"en"},

The RV is highly compliant, and is able to accommodate a wide range of preload conditions. Yet, it is afterload-sensitive, and normal physiology is dependent on its association with the low resistance of the pulmonary vasculature. Changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance, either acutely or over time, provoke a series of adaptations that are designed to maintain a normal cardiac output, but ultimately lead to decompensation and RV failure. Through ventricular interdependence, RV failure may impair left ventricular diastolic and systolic function, further reducing cardiac performance. Both echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging can provide detailed information about RV structure, with MRI providing better assessment of ventricular volumes and RV function. Right heart catheterization is often necessary for definitive diagnosis of the etiology of RV failure and for determining the best therapeutic options. The treatment of RV failure is highly dependent on the underlying etiology, which should be corrected if possible.

It has become increasingly clear that changes in the existing health care system will not be sufficient to maintain and improve our health at this historical juncture. Both our extensive knowledge on what creates health as well as the exponentially rising rates of chronic disease obesity, and mental health problems indicate that we need to shift course and apply a radically new mind-set to health and health policy. This is what we mean by policy innovations for health. The boundaries of what we call the \u201Chealth system\u201D are becoming increasingly fluid and health has become integral to how we live our everyday life. Health itself has become a major economic and social driving force in society. This shifts the pressure for policy innovation from a focus on the existing health system to a reorganization of how we approach health in 21st century societies. The dynamics of the health society challenge the way we conceptualize and locate health in the policy arena and the mechanisms through which we conduct health policy.

Nowadays, NoV is considered the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks and severe childhood diarrhoea worldwide, including water- and food-borne outbreaks. In animals, NoV infections have been reported in swine, bovine, ovine, canine, feline, and murine. The pathogenic role of NoV infection and its impact in animal health are not completely clear.

There are important differences between the oncologic patient with ARF compared to the general ICU population that likely underlie the increased mortality once intubated. Noninvasive oxygen modalities have been recognized as an important therapeutic approach to prevent intubation. Continuous low-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, and high-flow nasal cannula are the most commonly used noninvasive oxygen therapies in recent years.

However, though there are more than 7 billion people in the world, only 1 billion can expect to lead a long and healthy life. Unlike in the past, health problems are no longer confined within the individual countries. The SARS epidemic, which started in China in 2002, rapidly spread to 29 different countries in 8 months. The emissions of CO(2) in the United States and China may be causing an increase in floods in Bangladesh, as we show in the book. Global health has been defined by the United States Institute of Medicine as all those \u201Chealth problems, issues, and concerns that transcend national boundaries, may be influenced by circumstances or experiences in other countries, and are best addressed by co-operative actions and solutions.\u201D The concept of global health is connected with another important phenomenon, that of the epidemiological transition, or the continuous process according to which some diseases decline (many infectious diseases and those caused by malnutrition) and others spread (chronic \u201C non-communicable\u201D diseases). According to many indicators, including health, there is a general convergence of the countries in the world but also great internal inequalities in each country. In this chapter addresses the new health issues raised by globalisation, including the impact of economic and technological changes. In doing so, it tells three exemplary stories of globalisation and health: Nauru (a very early example of the impact of globalisation), Greece (the consequences of the economic crisis) and Bangladesh (one of the countries currently most exposed to the effects of climate change).","publish_time":"2017-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vineis, Paolo","journal":"Health Without Borders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CO","United States Institute of Medicine"],"locations":["China","Bangladesh","United States"],"keyphrases":["health problems","state of health","concept of global health","new health issues","world","different countries","individual countries","impact of globalisation","impact of economic","infectious diseases","China","Bangladesh","average global life expectancy","exemplary stories of globalisation","economic crisis","United States Institute of Medicine","healthy life","decades","Nauru","concerns","epidemiological transition","early example","great internal inequalities","continuous process","consequences","important phenomenon","Greece","effects of climate change","general convergence","country","national boundaries","malnutrition","increase","technological changes","circumstances","significant improvements","chapter","thanks","co-operative actions","solutions","number of deaths","measles","SARS epidemic","floods","months","experiences","past","estimated figure","vaccination","people","indicators","smallpox","emissions","book"],"language":"en"},

Perspectives for the field at both the basic research and the industrial level are emphasized. Perspectives considered of relevance in terms of basic research include (1) advancing the development of oral formulations, (2) expanding the modalities of expression of immunogens, (3) diversifying production platforms, particularly those performed under full containment, and (4) targeting a broader number of diseases. These goals are expected to multiply the expectations for benefits derived from plant-based vaccine-production technology. On the other hand, technology transfer and regulatory issues represent a critical hurdle to this technology becoming a reality. It is also critical to achieve social acceptance as well as implement initiatives for the exploitation of the technology for humanitarian purposes and for the benefit of poor countries. This overview predicts considerable potential for plant-based vaccines to positively impact the field of vaccinology in the near future.","publish_time":"2014-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Govea-Alonso, Dania O.; Rybicki, Edward; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio","journal":"Genetically Engineered Plants as a Source of Vaccines Against Wide Spread Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42d19adb203f33bed205e1af46a41297ab75884d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of plant","plant-based vaccine-production technology","technology transfer","plant-based vaccines","field of vaccinology","Perspectives","terms of basic research","critical hurdle","production platforms","development of new technologies","development of oral formulations","regulatory issues","exploitation","considerable potential","limitations","implement initiatives","humanitarian purposes","biotechnological approach","initial developments","social acceptance","hand","relevance","evolution","benefits","benefit of poor countries","immunogens","near future","expectations","overview","industrial level","broader number of diseases","modalities of expression","chapter","industry","reality","goals","containment"],"language":"en"},

As in many other types of crises, epidemic outbreaks may pose various degrees of surprise as well as various degrees of \u201Cderivatives\u201D of the surprise (i.e., the speed and acceleration of the surprise). Often, crises such as epidemic outbreaks are accompanied by a secondary set of crises, which might pose a more challenging prediction problem. One of the unique features of epidemic crises is the amount of fuzzy data related to the outbreak that spreads through numerous communication channels, including media and social networks. Hence, the key for improving epidemic crises prediction capabilities is in employing sound techniques for data collection, information processing, and decision making under uncertainty and exploiting the modalities and media of the spread of the fuzzy information related to the outbreak. Fuzzy logic-based techniques are some of the most promising approaches for crisis management. Furthermore, complex fuzzy graphs can be used to formalize the techniques and methods used for the data mining. Another advantage of the fuzzy-based approach is that it enables keeping account of events with perceived low possibility of occurrence via low fuzzy membership/truth-values and updating these values as information is accumulated or changed. In this chapter we introduce several soft computing based methods and tools for epidemic crises prediction. In addition to classical fuzzy techniques, the use of complex fuzzy graphs as well as incremental fuzzy clustering in the context of complex and high order fuzzy logic system is presented.","publish_time":"2014-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tamir, Dan E.; Rishe, Naphtali D.; Last, Mark; Kandel, Abraham","journal":"Intelligent Methods for Cyber Warfare","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/892781db890ef5fa05150cd893fcd3aab9cf6369.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fuzzy information","fuzzy data","classical fuzzy techniques","Fuzzy logic-based techniques","fuzzy-based approach","low fuzzy membership","incremental fuzzy clustering","use of complex fuzzy graphs","epidemic crises prediction capabilities","epidemic outbreaks","types of crises","unique features of epidemic crises","high order fuzzy logic system","secondary set of crises","sound techniques","information processing","uncertain information","various degrees of surprise","challenging prediction problem","Epidemical crisis prediction","context of complex","media","methods","data collection","data mining","challenging examples of decision","crisis management","perceived low possibility of occurrence","truth-values","tools","account of events","numerous communication channels","soft computing","uncertainty","spread","key","social networks","promising approaches","modalities","speed","derivatives","advantage","addition","chapter","acceleration"],"language":"en"},

Viroporins are generally very small (\u003C100 amino acids) integral membrane proteins that share common structure motifs (conserved cluster of basic residues adjacent to an amphipathic alpha-helix) but only limited sequence homology between viruses. Ion channel activity of viroporins is either required for replication or greatly enhances replication and pathogenesis. Channel characteristics have been investigated using standard electrophysiological techniques, including planar lipid bilayer, liposome patch clamp or whole-cell voltage clamp. In general, viroporins are voltage-independent non-specific monovalent cation channels, with the exception of the influenza A virus M2 channel that forms a highly specific proton channel due to a conserved HXXXW motif. Viroporin channel currents range between highly variable (\u2018burst-like\u2019) fluctuations to well resolved unitary (\u2018square-top\u2019) transitions, and emerging data indicates the quality of channel activity is influenced by many factors, including viroporin synthesis/solubilization, the lipid environment and the ionic composition of the buffers, as well as intrinsic differences between the viroporins themselves. Compounds that block viroporin channel activity are effective antiviral drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly distinct viroporins are inhibited by the same compounds (e.g., amantadines and amiloride derivatives), despite wide sequence divergence, raising the possibility of broadly acting antiviral drugs that target viroporins. Electrophysiology of viroporins will continue to play a critical role in elucidating the functional roles viroporins play in pathogenesis and to develop new drugs to combat viroporin-encoding pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hyser, Joseph M.","journal":"Electrophysiology of Unconventional Channels and Pores","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/583fe6c8dc311d6bdf64a271bf0ac679cd87ccef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119924.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HXXXW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ion channel activity of viroporins","termed viroporins","distinct viroporins","Electrophysiology of viroporins","viroporin channel activity","Channel characteristics","Viroporin channel currents","quality of channel activity","virus M2 channel","functional roles viroporins play","specific proton channel","viroporin synthesis","cell voltage clamp","host cell membrane","plasma membrane","effective antiviral drugs","pathogenesis","new drugs","Compounds","replication","integral membrane proteins","lipid environment","planar lipid bilayer","liposome patch clamp","voltage-independent non-specific monovalent cation channels","conserved HXXXW motif","wide sequence divergence","limited sequence homology","diverse set of viruses","conserved cluster of basic residues adjacent","common structure motifs","exception","compartment","amphipathic alpha-helix","standard electrophysiological techniques","exocytic vesicles","mitochondria","amiloride derivatives","Golgi","amino acids","solubilization","possibility","factors","emerging data","buffers","ionic composition","critical role","influenza","transitions","amantadines","intrinsic differences","fluctuations","burst","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we discuss the tools that have been developed to aid our understanding of mesothelioma such as cell lines and animal models. We then go on to detail the current use and understanding of conventional therapies for mesothelioma, e.g. chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy, plus their mechanisms of action, and why they may be ineffective. Finally, we discuss a range of newer treatments that are either undergoing clinical trials or are still in the earlier stages of preclinical investigation. These include a growing number of immunotherapies (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors), plus targeted therapies, the search for clinical biomarkers to predict whether patients with mesothelioma might respond to particular treatments, and combined therapies where conventional treatments may be added to newer drugs. The strategy of repositioning existing drugs, approved for other diseases, to treat mesothelioma is also discussed.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fear, Vanessa S.; Cook, Alistair M.; Fisher, Scott A.","journal":"Caring for Patients with Mesothelioma: Principles and Guidelines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21bcb4fb3749a9ad137bbb3293aee47e1d2417ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119960.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current understanding of mesothelioma","conventional therapies","conventional treatments","targeted therapies","combined therapies","particular treatments","range of newer treatments","newer drugs","clinical biomarkers","clinical trials","current use","strategy of repositioning existing drugs","terms of disease induction","checkpoint inhibitors","cell lines","chemotherapy","radiotherapy","development","search","patients","growing number of immunotherapies","decades of basic laboratory science","animal models","earlier stages of preclinical investigation","surgery","diseases","mechanisms of action","chapter","tools"],"language":"en"},

The most prominent representatives of DNA catalysts (also known as DNA enzymes, deoxyribozymes, or DNAzymes) catalyze the site-specific cleavage of RNA substrates. Two distinct groups of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes are the 10-23 and 8-17 enzymes. A typical RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme consists of a catalytic core and two short binding arms which form Watson\u2013Crick base pairs with the RNA targets. RNA cleavage is usually achieved with the assistance of metal ions such as Mg(2\u002B), Ca(2\u002B), Mn(2\u002B), Pb(2\u002B), or Zn(2\u002B), but several chemically modified DNA enzymes can cleave RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions. A number of studies have shown the use of 10-23 DNA enzymes for modest downregulation of therapeutically relevant RNA targets in cultured cells and in whole mammals. Here we focus on mechanistic aspects of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes and their potential to silence therapeutically appealing viral and bacterial gene targets. We also discuss delivery options and challenges involved in DNA enzyme-based therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2012-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pradeepkumar, P.
